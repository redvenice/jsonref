Just after Christmas apparently somebody complained to the police, saying it was offensive.‘Last month a lady from the police came in and asked if we could pull our sign in. And a bobby came in last Thursday. They’re just doing their job so I’m not annoyed with the iniduals.’Staffordshire Police have asked for its removal.What do people think ?When Pete took his signs down customers quickly complained about their absence, which led him to change his mind and he put them on the pavement again.He said: ‘I think it’s just blown out of proportion. I’m not trying to upset anybody, I’m not the kind of person who would write something genuinely horrible.’A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: ‘We’ve received no complaints about signage outside J W Ash and Son butchers in Leek.‘However, the local Chief Inspector for the Moorlands did advise the owner to give careful consideration to what was written on the boards in case anyone took offence.‘No other action has been taken.’MORE: Wave of Scottish booze cruises to England predicted after alcohol price hikeMORE: Why do people think the earth is flat?"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/465349272.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"kanye west says slavery choice latest facepalm moment","story":"Someone needs to hit the reset button on Kanye West like right now. Either that or just hit mute.During a Live chat with TMZ, Ye voiced a bizarre opinion that the 400 years of slavery suffered by black people was a ‘choice’. Yup the palm just met with the face.He told the hosts: ‘You hear about slavery for 400 years. 400 years? That sounds like a choice. 400 years and it’s all of y’all?’Trivialising nearly half a millennium of oppression and hugely offending the masses in one swift statement right there.Realising his comment was probably just a tad triggering, he tried to explain: ‘It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Like holocaust – Jews. Slavery is blacks.Has Kanye outdone himself with his latest rant? (Picture: Scott DudelsonFilmMagic)‘Prison is something that unites us as one race, blacks and whites.’But the damage was done, as his words had seriously offended TMZ reporter Van Lathan, who stood up to the 40-year-old on camera and called him out on his terrible choice of words.As Kanye asked: ‘Do you feel like I’m thinking free,’ the man responded: ‘I don’t think you’re thinking anything, it’s the absence of thought.’ Well said.‘You’re entitled to your opinion. But there is fact and real word consequence behind everything you just said,’ he continued.Kanye West attempts to defend shocking comments that slavery was a \u0027choice\u0027As Kanye looked dumbfounded that someone had disagreed, Van Lathan added: ‘And while you’re living the life you earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives. We have to deal with the marginalisation that’s come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was a choice.‘Frankly, I’m disappointed, I’m appalled, and brother. I am unbelievably hurt.’As the rapper went to apologise to Lathan, he added: ‘You’ve got to be responsible your voice is too big.’Hilariously, this exchange had almost been predicted a year ago, when one Twitter made this comment:So has Kanye is cancelled and has become predictable.

(Picture: Alexander Crawley)What I Rent is ’s weekly series that takes you inside people’s rentals in London.Because trying to find a place in London to rent can be hellish.It’s tricky to know how much is a ‘normal’ amount to be paying each month. Countless viewings make you start to genuinely consider living in a flat with a fold-out bed in the kitchen. Meanwhile, you see other people’s perfectly decorated homes on Instagram and wonder what on earth you’re doing wrong.There’s a lot of mystery and confusion when it comes to renting, which isn’t helped by estate agents’ very flattering photos of ‘cosy’ studio flats and the average renter’s reticence to openly chat about what they’re getting for how much they’re paying.**Either because they’re embarrassed by just how much they’re spending, or they don’t want to make us all feel bad because they have a bargain.To get rid of the mystery, we’re going inside different Londoners’ rented properties each week, for a look at all the bits landlords might not show you.This week we’re talking to Miranda and George, who live with their two cats, Chess and Cinder.They pay £1,283 per month, plus £170 in bills. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How much are you paying?Miranda: We pay roughly £1,283, plus £170 a month in bills. We’ve been trying to a more eco-friendly electricity provider but they keep screwing up the account.Bizarrely, this was the cheapest flat we could find and it’s in the nicest area we looked. Some es in North London are charging over £1,300 a month for what looks like a slightly spruced up slum.And what are you getting for that price?Miranda: It’s got three rooms and a balcony – a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan livingcookingdining space.It’s in Highgate, just down from Boogaloo. We’re not talking Highgate Village here (the ultra expensive, lush bit), but we were drinking in the same local as Jude Law last weekend….How long have you lived there?The flat has a bedroom, a bathroom, and an open plan living roomdining roomkitchen. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)How did you find it?Miranda: We set off one day determined to not return to my parent’s house until we’d found a flat.We started in Camden and walked up here – stopping at every single estate agent. We were just about to give up and head back east when we spotted a tiny estate agent next to Highgate station, and this was the first property they showed us. We fell immediately in love.George: Through a lot of searching. For the price we’re paying and the areas we were looking at, it was quite a full on process and we missed out on a couple of places before finally finding this one. But I’d say this was the best of any we saw for the price.And do you like it?We’re perfectly positioned at the top of the hill between Archway, Muswell Hill, Crouch End and Highgate Village. It’s perfect for running (try running up the hill from Chalk Farm and you’ll soon get a sweat on), it’s leafy, it’s got great transport links and there are any number of bars and restaurants.Unfortunately, we moved here in November when it was dark and miserable and we were both on quite strict training regimes so we’re only just starting to get to know the area properly and take full advantage of all its features.It was the cheapest place the couple could find. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)I’m learning to play tennis in the most beautiful park five minutes from the flat and as soon as the weather comes back, we’re off to start swimming in Hampstead Ponds.Oh, and it’s super quick to get to the Emirates which is a blessing given the number of mid week 7.45 kick off games!George: Yes, I’m very much happy with where we live. It’s quiet enough to escape a lot of hustle and bustle from the centre of London but has easy and quick access to virtually wherever we’d want to go.We’re still exploring the area having moved in relatively recently but there’s certainly a bit more of a suburban feel, which suits me as I’m not originally from here.Do you have enough space for both of you and the cats?Miranda: Yes, but we have a lot of crap – we’re both hoarders. You can never have enough space.George: Absolutely. The balcony really adds an extra dimension in the summer and catches the sun from that side but even when not using that in the warm weather, I’ve not felt cramped at all.The balcony is a definite highlight. (Picture: Alexander Crawley)Are there any annoying bits about the place where you live?Miranda: At the start I couldn’t work out how to operate the heating and there’s a serious draft from the balcony (no double glazing). But now that it’s warmer, that draft is kind of a blessing.George: Not really. Again, not being from London, I’d say the price we’re paying is absolutely extortionate for what we’re getting (even though we do really like it) but that’s more of a general gripe with living in this ridiculously overpriced city, I guess…Any plans to move again?Miranda: Next year…but who’s to say what or where.George: I’d be happy to escape London ASAP but don’t have any immediate plans to go anywhere.Or who knows? I might even start saving some money elsewhere…And have you thought about buying a place?Miranda: I lived at home for so long with the express purpose of saving for my own place. I still haven’t given up hope although I’m starting to wonder if it wouldn’t be more expedient to just buy somewhere outside of London.My dad kept nagging me to buy somewhere in Barking a few years ago and I scoffed at him – why would I want a place even further out than my parents?Now, of course, they’re saying that Barking is THE place to invest and prices have already doubled. I’m a fool.Now, let’s have a nosy around Miranda and George’s place…What I Rent is \u0027s weekly series that takes you inside the places in London people are renting, to give us all a better sense of what\u0027s normal and how much we should be paying.

I looked into travelling and volunteering.‘As soon as I read about house-sitting, a lightbulb went off. I signed up within the hour.’Splitting up from her ex-husband, who she does not wish to name, Angela’s life felt stagnant, so she decided to take action.Angela in Australia (Picture: PA Real Life)‘I’ve always been keen on travel. I emigrated from England to New Zealand’s North Island in 2003 – but wanted to see even more of the world,’ she said.Angela’s daughter Maisie, 17, who was living with her, convinced her mum to go for it after they discovered TrustedHousesitters, a website connecting homeowners with people willing to care for their pets and property while they are away.Angela continued: ‘I didn’t want her to feel like I was leaving her behind, but Maisie was adamant. She kept saying, “Mum, you have to go for it.”‘So, she’s been staying with her Dad, his new wife and her family while I’ve been travelling. I really miss her, but this experience has been so fulfilling.’At first, Angela did some house-sitting locally in New Zealand to find her feet and secure some good reviews on her website profile.Then, in December 2016, she took the plunge and left for Australia.Angela doing bee-keeping in Serpentine, Australia (Picture: PA Real Life)Starting in Serpentine, south west of Perth, she spent Christmas and New Year at a property with a menagerie of animals.After another month Down Under, she jetted across the globe to the UK, to be reunited with family she had not seen in years.Retracing her childhood steps, she worked her way across the south coast, staying in Devon, Somerset and Cornwall.‘Sadly, my dad Ken died of cancer aged 85 while I was in the UK,’ she said. ‘But the house sitting meant I could stay out as long as I needed, go to the funeral and be there for the family.’Since then, Angela has been living entirely on back-to-back house sits, caring for all manner of animals, from bees and reptiles to horses and livestock.She continued: ‘I have had a couple of mishaps. I managed to electrocute myself on the fridge light at one property and gave myself terrible food poisoning at another.Angela and Maisie in New Zealand (Picture: PA Real Life)‘I’ve locked myself out a fair few times too.’Heading to New Zealand in November 2017, Angela had a longed-for reunion with Maisie, before spending two months exploring the North Shore, near Auckland.Currently, she’s staying at a property in Wanaka, a lakeside resort on the South Island surrounded by snow-capped mountains.‘I’m managing an Air B\u0026ampB for my friend at the moment just to build back up my money,’ she explained.‘So far, I’ve just been relying on my savings to get by. I got half from the house sale, split between my ex husband and I.’Angela has organised lots of other back-to-back stays, and will be exploring the rest of New Zealand until September, going back to the North Island where she’ll be reuinited with Maisie.Then, she has no idea where she will visit next – but is adamant it will need to be by the sea.Angela with a dog she’s looked after (Picture: PA Real Life)As a thank you to the home owners, she has been using her skills as an artist to create intricate sketches of the pets she looks after, to give as keepsakes.Each takes her between 20 and 25 hours, and she has also set up a website, hoping to secure commissions from people she has not met to help fund her travels.‘I’d absolutely recommend house sitting to people. It’s a fantastic way to see the world, and you get to help somebody out in the process.‘I’ve met loads of fantastic people, it’s been so fulfilling.’MORE: Two pigs who were once used for cruel experiments now live happily on a farmMORE: Sun, sea and snorkelling: 13 reasons why you will fall in love with the remote Rodrigues Island"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/21/4B54270B00000578-0-image-m-44_1524170616142.jpg","title":"Paris Hilton fianc Chris Zylka wed November","story":"    Paris Hilton, 37, and her fiancé Chris Zylka, 32, will wed in Beverly Hills, California, on November 11, a family insider has told DailyMail.com          Paris confirmed that she was engaged to Zylka in an Instagram post of the proposal in Instagram in early January           Paris and Zylka first met eight years ago at an Oscars party at Chateau Marmont but didn\u0027t start dating until 2016, finally making it official on social media in February 2017\u0027No one is quite sure of the significance of the \u00271111\u0027 wedding date, but that\u0027s what they\u0027ve chosen,\u0027 the insider told DailyMail.com. \u0027It\u0027s on a Sunday, but following day is a holiday (Veteran\u0027s Day) so it will be a long weekend celebration.\u0027Paris has strong ties to tradition and wants to have the wedding close to hope so her grandfather, Barron Hilton, can attend, the insider said.The church seats 600 people, and was also the site of Elizabeth Taylor\u0027s first wedding to Paris\u0027 great uncle Conrad \u0027Nicky\u0027 Hilton in 1950.

I guess it hurt enough for me to remember 60 years later\u0027.\u0027According to Simon, people thought Garfunkel was the one who wrote the songs, not him, because he \u0027looks like he writes the songs\u0027.Simon said: \u0027It came up all the time. There is a prejudice against small men and that has been a problem at times because I happen to be a sort of alpha male-ish type guy. It becomes a competitive thing.\u0027There\u0027s this attitude that \u0027I\u0027m taller, so I could beat you up, or I should be in charge\u0027.          By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027. Simon and Jagger are pictured above in 1989Eventually, when he was in his 40s, Simon said to himself: \u0027Listen man, if you\u0027re going to make a big issue out of what you don\u0027t have, you\u0027re taking your actual gifts for granted….that\u0027s the hand I\u0027ve been dealt with. That\u0027s the way I\u0027m going to play it\u0027.Elsewhere in the book Simon talks about how his height was bound up in his long running mental health issues.In 1981 he went to see Los Angeles psychiatrist Rod Gorney and told him he was so unhappy he couldn\u0027t write songs anymore.Hilburn quotes an interview with Simon from 1984 in which he says that from the outside people could not understand why he was depressed, but inside he was looking at the \u0027thin slice of the pie that has got the bad news in it\u0027.What he meant by bad news: \u0027being short\u0027, his voice and his relationships.Simon said that his issues left him \u0027unable to absorb the bounty that was in my life\u0027 and he used to joke that he would happily pay $5 million to look like his hero Elvis Presley, who was 6ft 2in tall.Simon, 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees.But his dream died because of something that Hiburn says would \u0027haunt him for years: his size\u0027. By 1960 Simon started fretting about his thinning hair as well because all his role models like The Beatles and Mick Jagger were, as he put it \u0027skinny and tall, and they had a lot of hair\u0027.          Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade. They attended the same high school and began to play music together. The pair are pictured together in 1957          Simon (right with Garfunkel), 76, grew up in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, New York, and dreamed about playing for the New York Yankees. But his dream died because of his small statureSimon said: \u0027That\u0027s what rock\u0027n\u0027roll was, and it was a really big thing with me.\u0027I once had this conversation with John Lennon, and he really wanted to know how I knew enough to keep my own publishing rather than give half of it away like the Beatles did. I told him I grew up around the music business....then I asked him: \u0027Who ever told you how to comb your hair like that?\u0027\u0027Much of \u0027The Life\u0027 is taken up with the love-hate - mostly hate - relationship between Simon and Garfunkel.Simon first saw Garfunkel in 1951 at an assembly in their school when they were in the fourth grade.They attended the same high school and began to play music together. Their first single was an R\u0026ampB number titled, \u0027Sh-Boom\u0027 in 1954. And even before they turned 18, the boys were being played on national radio. In 1957, however, they suffered a split that \u0027caused a wound so deep in Art it would never heal fully\u0027.Sid Prosen, the owner of the record label called Big which signed them, asked Simon if he could record some songs on his own and \u0027caught up in the excitement of the moment\u0027, Simon agreed.Hilburn writes that their \u0027massive mistake\u0027 was not telling Garfunkel who knew he had a great voice but was \u0027dependent on Paul for songs, which meant Paul had all the power\u0027.Garfunkel \u0027always felt in danger of being tossed aside\u0027, the book says. Simon\u0027s song flopped as did their next collaborative project and the pair went their separate ways for five years. Tank tops, flock wallpaper and a cheese plant in the corner:...\u0027She just wanted to know that he\u0027s in jail\u0027: Patton Oswalt...Share this article    Simon and Garfunkel, pictured above in 1993, have long had a love-hate relationship with each other. The biggest blow up came in 1993, when Simon\u0027s business manager had to to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.They would go through the same cycle for the next 50 years reconciliation and fighting before breaking up once more. The biggest blow up came in 1993. Simon and Garfunkel had reunited for a series of shows in New York called Event of a Lifetime that sold out so fast they added 14 more nights to the ten-night run.But the old tensions came back straight away, and Joseph Rascoff, Simon\u0027s business manager, had to physically get between their dressing rooms to stop anything from happening.He said: \u0027I genuinely believed that if there had been a knife on the table, one of them would have used it\u0027.At one point Garfunkel accused Simon of getting a journalist to write a negative review of one of the sets.On another night, while playing their hit \u0027The Boxer\u0027, Garfunkel suddenly stopped singing, which Simon thought was a mistake. But after the show Garfunkel told him: \u0027I didn\u0027t forget. I just wanted you to see what it feels like to be made a fool of\u0027.The two men went at each other and, recounting the episode, Rascoff said: \u0027They never came to blows but there was shoving, and I had to step between them\u0027.Simon described the incident as \u0027ugly - the most vicious fight, verbally at least, I\u0027d had in my life\u0027.Simon ided opinion among those who met him and a veteran from the British club scene in the 1960s called him \u0027shy, arrogant, self-assured, ruthlessly determined\u0027.           Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974. He\u0027s pictured above, second from left, with Garfunkel (left), Yoko Ono (second right)  and Lennon in 1974Other said that he was so obsessed with music that human relationships came second.Joan Bata, a friend of his first girlfriend Kathy Chitty, said: \u0027He wasn\u0027t deliberately being hurtful. It was just that his mind was totally occupied with something else.\u0027The most striking breakup was with his first wife Peggy which is described with brutal starkness in the book.In 1974 the couple were due to go to their home in New Hope, Connecticut, but Simon was listening to his competition in that years\u0027 Grammy Awards, Stevie Wonder\u0027s Innervisions.Peggy called him to join her but he was too caught up in the music so she called him again and he became angry, thinking to himself: \u0027Can\u0027t I even listen to music any more?\u0027          Robert Hilburn\u0027s biography, Paul Simon: The Life, is out on May 8 on Simon \u0026amp SchusterAs the book puts it: \u0027When Peggy called out a third time, the marriage was over\u0027. Simon simply walked out of their townhouse and moved into the Stanhope Hotel around the corner until their orce was finalized.In the book, Simon said: \u0027Ultimately I wasn\u0027t ready for marriage. The marriage didn\u0027t solve the loneliness. I knew right away I had made a mistake. \u0027I didn\u0027t know how to be a good companion. I wasn\u0027t a very mature person. I didn\u0027t understand you had to work at problems. I wanted the marriage to solve my problems.\u0027\u0027The Life\u0027 says that Simon did not get on with some celebrities, including John Lennon when they were supposed to be working on a covers album in 1974.Lennon was constantly drunk and when Simon started to play acoustic guitar on \u0027Rock Island Line\u0027 before Lennon wanted he repeatedly told him to stop.Then Lennon started to reach over and mute Simon\u0027s guitar strings with his hand. A frustrated Simon told him: \u0027John, I play guitar too.\u0027May Pang, who was staying with Lennon at the time, said that Lennon was annoyed by Simon because \u0027unlike almost everybody else who entered John\u0027s orbit (Simon) had a powerful sense of himself and could actually refuse to be treated badly\u0027.In 2002 Simon was in Washington to receive a Kennedy Center Honor to receive an award for his lifetime of achievement to American culture through the performing arts.As he sat next to Elizabeth Taylor they watched as Alicia Keys butchered Bridge Over Troubled Water.Taylor leaned over to Simon and said: \u0027Tell me, Paul, does it upset you when somebody f**** up one of your songs?\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/17/4BB59ACE00000578-0-image-m-46_1525106173356.jpg","title":"Doria Ragland visits Oprah Winfrey 88m mansion","story":"    Meghan Markle\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland (right) was spotted over the weekend visiting Oprah Winfrey at her home in California, just three weeks ahead of the royal wedding  Ragland made a visit to Winfrey\u0027s $88million \u0027Promised Land\u0027 mansion in Santa Barbara on Saturday as expectations mount for her daughter\u0027s wedding to Prince Harry in LondonBut a source told DailyMail.com: \u0027No one knows how to schmooze better than Oprah.

Yes, it breaks that non-disclosure agreement, but it’s the truth. There was bullying.’Mr Bercow’s office strenuously denied the bullying claims, saying many of his other staff had been happy to work with him for years.The revelations come weeks after it emerged that a judge-led inquiry into alleged bullying and harassment of Commons staff would not investigate inidual complaints. It led to claims that the probe, ordered by the House of Commons Commission, will be nothing more than a whitewash. The Commission is chaired by the Speaker.          Angus Sinclair, who said he was repeatedly undermined by Mr Bercow, finding himself the victim of angry outbursts, foul-mouthed tirades and mimicryMr Sinclair served for 30 years in the Royal Navy and joined the House of Commons in 2005 as the private secretary to Michael Martin, the previous Speaker, who died on Sunday. Mr Bercow succeeded him in 2009.As well as running the Speaker’s office, the private secretary also has a role in the Commons chamber, assisting him in his duties.Describing Mr Bercow’s behaviour, Mr Sinclair said: ‘The Speaker responded in a way that I can only say is a form of bullying.‘And that is to show anger, to thump the table to say that someone has failed in front of others. It seemed to get more frequent.’Newsnight said other Commons staff have corroborated the account, saying he was undermined in meetings and held responsible for things that were beyond his power. Mr Sinclair also recorded examples of the bullying in his diary.He added: ‘There was one afternoon I was working at my desk and he came in and was absolutely furious about something. \u0027He asked for some information from another part of the House.‘It had been very slow coming and I’d prodded for an early resolution and he knew that but he held me responsible. \u0027There was a tirade of how I’d let him down and it was the worst thing...‘There was a lot of bad language and suddenly his mobile phone which he’d been holding was flung on the desk in front of me and broke into a lot of bits.’Mr Sinclair says that after the 2010 general election he was called in to see Mr Bercow who told him he was going to ‘redesign the office’ and that he would not be needed. He was given a ‘compulsory early retirement’ with a severance package worth £86,250, which was more than a year’s pay.The payment was explicitly dependent on his signing a non-disclosure agreement that would bar him from speaking to the media or raising a complaint about his treatment.Mr Sinclair said: ‘I can only think it was because of the detail of what had happened, you know, the bullying and the manner of my leaving. What I’d done was sign a cover-up.’He was replaced in the role by Kate Emms, who it has been claimed was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after less than a year of working for Mr Bercow. The Speaker has also denied bullying her.A spokesman for the Speaker’s Office told Newsnight: ‘Mr Speaker strenuously denies that there is any substance to any of these allegations.‘Mr Speaker has a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff – five of whom have worked for him very happily for a combined total of over 40 years.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/01/22/4BBD8F5B00000578-0-image-m-3_1525209251935.jpg","title":"Former boarding school pupils dominating jobs dont waste study time long commutes","story":"    Martin Reader, the head of the private Cranleigh School in Surrey, said that boarding schools provide advantages to childrenOusted AA chief suing firm for £220m \u0027covered up street...Brexit could make children healthier: Jamie Oliver says...Share this articleAnd many boarding schools are also now able to completely eradicate online bullying by simply banning smartphones for younger age groups, he said.It comes after former education secretary Justine Greening suggested employers should discriminate against alumni of top private schools like Eton because they are ‘not as impressive’ as those with the same grades from struggling comprehensives.She said bosses should use ‘contextual admissions’ to see how privileged youngsters had been in their education.Mr Reader, who is also head of the private Cranleigh School in Surrey, said it was no secret that boarding schools provided many advantages for children.Speaking at the BSA annual conference in Brighton yesterday, he said: ‘What sets a boarding education apart from all others is the time that we have with the children, and the time they have with each other.‘When people question why our schools dominate the nations’ sports, creative and performing arts, the professions and politics, it is because they have had time to do those things and time with experts to coach them.          His comments come after Education secretary Justine Greening (pictured) suggested that employers should discriminate against boarding school pupils‘Why sit in a car or on a train or a bus for 45 minutes twice a day, or in a bedroom by yourself hunched over homework or a screen?‘You could be spending those hours rehearsing for a play, having a band practice, spending more time mastering your musical instrument or your goal shooting technique, spending more hours perfecting that painting, debating or discussing politics or science or history - whatever is your passion.‘Or, perhaps more importantly, real face-to-face, social time, not always virtual socialising.’The BSA represents 550 boarding schools, including some of the most elite private institutions as well as a number which are state-funded.Mr Reader said all of his schools pride themselves on encouraging children to pursue extra curricular activities in their evenings and weekends.And at Cranleigh, sixth formers are expected to do 15 hours per week of extra study outside of lessons.He said that for many children in modern Britain, a long commute to school is inevitable because they cannot get into their local school.Some parents considering boarding have even mentioned this as a motivating factor, he added.‘There are some good things about commuting to school,’ he said.‘It’s independence, and some children have no alternative.‘But wouldn’t it be better if they were able to spend that time doing lovely things?‘Why waste that time on a commute?’Mr Reader said boarding schools are also an ideal place to tackle social media, which can distract pupils from studies and cause online bullying.At Cranleigh, all pupils aged 13 are banned from having smartphones, and this has eradicated all cyberbullying for that age group, he said.‘A smartphone was not designed for a child,’ he said.‘We use to get an incident a week of something unpleasant for that age group but now we’ve had nothing.‘Children that age are not mature enough for it.‘We restrict alcohol and cigarettes as a society because they are addictive, so why not restrict something as addictive as a mobile phone.’Smart phone use is gradually phased in for older children - alongside special lessons about how to stay safe online.Sixth formers have no restrictions as they are thought to be mature enough to use phones appropriately.He added: ‘We have and many of our schools have restrictions on social media either through controlling WiFi, controlling the apps they can use, and encouraging them to spend more time with each other, doing activities where they’re not using social media. It’s beneficial.‘It encourages kids to spend real time with each other, not virtual time with each other.‘What we have done is be equally illiberal for everybody. It has helped parents. One of the hardest things about being a parent is that your child says “everyone else has got one”. There is a pressure.‘So it’s helpful when we’re all in this together.’Mr Reader also responded to Miss Greening’s comments yesterday.He said: ‘We need social mobility in this country. But businesses have to make their own decisions about what is right. It is not for government to tell businesses who is the right person for them.‘There is a real danger in constantly talking about privileged children and underprivileged children. Let’s just talk about children.‘I want to see more social mobility. But we can’t dictate what a company should do.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/00/4BBFCFDB00000578-5680351-image-a-2_1525216029937.jpg","title":"Young mothers UKs loneliest people unable afford study finds","story":"    Young mums are suffering from loneliness and many struggle financially, a poll of 2,500 adults has found          Loneliness in young mothers is causing health problems, according to a new study. More than 40 per cent of women who have babies before the age of 30  are lonely, study findsIsolation among young mothers is particularly concentrated in single mothers, with 54 per cent saying they are lonely often or all the time.

The average age of a new mother was 30.4 in England and Wales in 2016. Fertility rates among over 30s are rising as more women choose to pursue education and careers and to delay having families.As a result younger mothers are more likely to be less well-educated, less well-off and without a husband or permanent partner. The most acute loneliness is among the youngest mothers, who are also the least likely to be married or living with the father of a child.Some 49 per cent of mothers aged between 18 and 25 say they are often or always lonely, against 37 per cent of 26 to 30-year-olds.Paul Gerrard of the Co-op said: ‘People do not think of young mothers as being susceptible to being lonely but our research clearly highlights that it is a major problem.’          Financial problems leaving Britain\u0027s young mums suffering from loneliness.

Social psychologist Dr Juliet Wakefield of Nottingham Trent University said: ‘The top 10 per cent of attendees to a GP account for 30 to 50 per cent of appointments, placing a considerable strain on the healthcare system.‘They are likely to be dissatisfied with the care they receive, and are often cited by physicians as a cause of occupational stress and burnout.

Yes, it breaks that non-disclosure agreement, but it’s the truth. There was bullying.’Mr Bercow’s office strenuously denied the bullying claims, saying many of his other staff had been happy to work with him for years.The revelations come weeks after it emerged that a judge-led inquiry into alleged bullying and harassment of Commons staff would not investigate inidual complaints. It led to claims that the probe, ordered by the House of Commons Commission, will be nothing more than a whitewash. The Commission is chaired by the Speaker.          Angus Sinclair, who said he was repeatedly undermined by Mr Bercow, finding himself the victim of angry outbursts, foul-mouthed tirades and mimicryMr Sinclair served for 30 years in the Royal Navy and joined the House of Commons in 2005 as the private secretary to Michael Martin, the previous Speaker, who died on Sunday. Mr Bercow succeeded him in 2009.As well as running the Speaker’s office, the private secretary also has a role in the Commons chamber, assisting him in his duties.Describing Mr Bercow’s behaviour, Mr Sinclair said: ‘The Speaker responded in a way that I can only say is a form of bullying.‘And that is to show anger, to thump the table to say that someone has failed in front of others. It seemed to get more frequent.’Newsnight said other Commons staff have corroborated the account, saying he was undermined in meetings and held responsible for things that were beyond his power. Mr Sinclair also recorded examples of the bullying in his diary.He added: ‘There was one afternoon I was working at my desk and he came in and was absolutely furious about something. \u0027He asked for some information from another part of the House.‘It had been very slow coming and I’d prodded for an early resolution and he knew that but he held me responsible. \u0027There was a tirade of how I’d let him down and it was the worst thing...‘There was a lot of bad language and suddenly his mobile phone which he’d been holding was flung on the desk in front of me and broke into a lot of bits.’Mr Sinclair says that after the 2010 general election he was called in to see Mr Bercow who told him he was going to ‘redesign the office’ and that he would not be needed. He was given a ‘compulsory early retirement’ with a severance package worth £86,250, which was more than a year’s pay.The payment was explicitly dependent on his signing a non-disclosure agreement that would bar him from speaking to the media or raising a complaint about his treatment.Mr Sinclair said: ‘I can only think it was because of the detail of what had happened, you know, the bullying and the manner of my leaving. What I’d done was sign a cover-up.’He was replaced in the role by Kate Emms, who it has been claimed was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after less than a year of working for Mr Bercow. The Speaker has also denied bullying her.A spokesman for the Speaker’s Office told Newsnight: ‘Mr Speaker strenuously denies that there is any substance to any of these allegations.‘Mr Speaker has a superb team of dedicated, effective and long-serving staff – five of whom have worked for him very happily for a combined total of over 40 years.’  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/00/4BBFCFDB00000578-5680351-image-a-2_1525216029937.jpg","title":"Young mothers UKs loneliest people unable afford study finds","story":"    Young mums are suffering from loneliness and many struggle financially, a poll of 2,500 adults has found          Loneliness in young mothers is causing health problems, according to a new study. More than 40 per cent of women who have babies before the age of 30  are lonely, study findsIsolation among young mothers is particularly concentrated in single mothers, with 54 per cent saying they are lonely often or all the time.

The average age of a new mother was 30.4 in England and Wales in 2016. Fertility rates among over 30s are rising as more women choose to pursue education and careers and to delay having families.As a result younger mothers are more likely to be less well-educated, less well-off and without a husband or permanent partner. The most acute loneliness is among the youngest mothers, who are also the least likely to be married or living with the father of a child.Some 49 per cent of mothers aged between 18 and 25 say they are often or always lonely, against 37 per cent of 26 to 30-year-olds.Paul Gerrard of the Co-op said: ‘People do not think of young mothers as being susceptible to being lonely but our research clearly highlights that it is a major problem.’          Financial problems leaving Britain\u0027s young mums suffering from loneliness.

Social psychologist Dr Juliet Wakefield of Nottingham Trent University said: ‘The top 10 per cent of attendees to a GP account for 30 to 50 per cent of appointments, placing a considerable strain on the healthcare system.‘They are likely to be dissatisfied with the care they receive, and are often cited by physicians as a cause of occupational stress and burnout.

Now the papers need to sign up.’IPSO regulates the vast majority of British newspapers with its members including most of the national papers.Those taking part in the present voluntary scheme include the Daily Mail, the Times, the Sun, the Daily Telegraph, Daily Mirror and Daily Express.

Legal claims that can be heard by an arbitrator under the scheme, without the claimant facing unaffordable legal costs associated with court actions, include libel, invasion of privacy, data protection and harassment.Bringing an arbitration case will cost the claimant a maximum of £100. And under the new rules they could be awarded up to £60,000, including aggravated damages.IPSO’s chief executive, Matt Tee, said of the development: ‘Lord Justice Leveson stressed the importance of having a low-cost means of people that had been wronged by a newspaper getting compensation, without the expense of court and legal fees.‘The new IPSO scheme does exactly that and the papers are not able to choose which cases they take.’Once IPSO has accepted the claim, a senior barrister will be appointed as an arbitrator. The arbitrator then makes a preliminary ruling on some of the issues at the centre of the dispute.This will indicate how likely it is that the claim will succeed and provide a basis for settlement negotiations.If either of the parties wants to continue the claim, it then goes to a final ruling stage. If the claim is successful, the arbitrator can award damages of up to £60,000.The existing scheme has been in place for 18 months. IPSO will now be writing to its members to set out details of the new rules, which will go live by July 31."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/02/01/0A8C620F000005DC-5680693-image-a-3_1525222648256.jpg","title":"James Bulgers mother says Jon Venables new identity not revealed","story":"The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger is not supporting an application to reveal the new identity of his killer Jon Venables (pictured after the killing)The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger is not backing a legal challenge to have the new identity of killer Jon Venables revealed.James\u0027s mother, Denise Fergus, said on Tuesday that she is not involved in the High Court proceedings launched by the murdered toddler\u0027s father Ralph Bulger.Ms Fergus says that while she \u0027understands the motivation\u0027, she is not supporting the application.In a statement, she said: \u0027I understand the motivation for the application, but my concern is that if Venables were known by his own name, it could lead to vigilante action and innocent people being hurt. \u0027Beyond that, I have no further comment to make.\u0027The father and uncle of the murdered toddler  launched a legal challenge against an order made almost two decades ago which has allowed the killer Jon Venables to live under a cloak of anonymity.Details of an application by Ralph and Jimmy Bulger were aired at the High Court for the first time at a hearing in London on Tuesday.Sir James Munby, the most senior family judge in England and Wales, was asked to deal with preliminary issues in the case which relates to an order originally granted in 2001.As the proceedings got under way, Sir James, President of the High Court\u0027s Family Division, confirmed that James Bulger\u0027s mother Denise was not involved in the application.The father and uncle are represented by solicitor-advocate Robin Makin, who told the judge he needed material relating to the proceedings dating back 18 or 19 years to prepare his case properly. Mr Makin said it was because the injunction was granted on the basis that Venables was rehabilitated and would not re-offend.The situation has changed as he has since been convicted on two separate occasions, most recently in February.

Then she heard the proposed name for it – Caroline Coon: The Great Offender. “I just gasped,” she says.It didn’t take her long to realise that, actually, the name was perfect. Offending – and offending greatly – has been a large part of what Coon has spent her life doing, even if it hasn’t always been intentional. In the 1960s, she flew in the face of the establishment by setting up the drugs agency Release, which helped young people who had been arrested for drugs offences. Its clients included John Lennon and George Harrison. A decade later, she was offending her own hippy generation by documenting the punk scene for Melody Maker, providing bands with artwork for their record sleeves, and even becoming the Clash’s manager for a while. But it’s with her oil paintings and collages that she’s made some of her most provocative statements, breaking down taboos and challenging ideas of what a female artist is expected to paint. The evidence is currently displayed over every inch of wallspace in her home and studio in west London where we meet (and when the walls run out, her works stack up on the floor). Brothel scenes sit next to self-portraits replete with wrinkled wrist flesh (“You rarely see portraits of old women,” says Coon, “because we go from being whores to being witches”). Then there’s her depiction of Valerie Solanas (who shot Andy Warhol) complete with severed penis on a plate, as well as her wonderful, gender-blurring tangles of male and female bodies. They seem particularly prescient in our era of sexual fluidity, yet at the time they gained Coon the reductive nickname of The Woman Who Paints Penises. That must have been frustrating. “Frustrating?” she laughs: “No, it was a triumph! Why wouldn’t I be a woman who paints penises? That was the whole point! To be a lady was to never admit that one liked sexuality – you were meant to bear it. Even the feminists of the 70s talked about the penis as a hate object, which I found very unhealthy. Because in my heterosexual mode” – she lets out another laugh at this – “the penis is something I love to draw into myself. Of course I need to love this object!”In person, the Great Offender couldn’t be any less offensive: she’s warm and funny and has even bought fresh fruit in for the interview because she’d heard I’d been unwell. She talks about sex workers’ rights, nuclear brinkmanship and the tragedy of Grenfell tower – which you can see starkly from her living room window – in unapologetically cut-glass tones that make you wonder what the punks must have made of her back in the day. At one point, when a question about her art delights her, she takes my hand and kisses it with gratitude. Yet offending people has always been in Coon’s blood. As the child of wealthy Kent landowners, she found herself trapped in an oppressively patriarchal system where, she says, “the question was always, ‘How can I grow up into a woman who does not cause offence?’ I couldn’t be assertive, or have an opinion, and I was warned that I should hide one’s intelligence because men didn’t like intelligent women. You were expected to grow into a respectable woman, a wife and a bearer of children. Even at the age of 13, I knew I couldn’t be that.” Aware of the pain her mother and grandmother suffered after giving up on their own artistic dreams, Coon moved to London to enrol at Central St Martins. Even that could be stifling: “I went through college without being told such a thing as a woman artist existed,” she says. However she did notice the emergence of such artists as Pauline Boty, who typified women who were “working side by side with their male colleagues but not included in most of the big exhibitions”.It was Boty’s husband Clive Goodwin who gifted Coon the pop artist’s oils following her death in 1966 at the age of 28. Coon used them to paint her playful tribute to Boty’s landmark work Bum, a full frontal called simply Cunt. Not all Coon’s work deals in outrage: there are joyous street scenes celebrating the ersity of her neighbourhood and plenty of still lifes depicting tulips and peonies. Other paintings are approached with subtlety. Her Brothel Series inverts the way male artists have depicted prostitutes by putting the same scenes through a feminist lens. Sometimes this can be a typical street scene, but tucked away in the background is a punter reading a card in a shop window, or slipping down some steps. In Ladbroke Grove, Dawn: She Walks Home From Work, the car driver’s eyes are trained not on the road but at the woman traipsing home after a night shift. Coon knows she has a right to paint these scenes because she’s lived them. Her illustrated memoir Laid Bare documented her brief time as a sex worker in the early 80s. It is full of bracing honesty about the experience, as well as paintings inspired by the experience. “I did that series because I think it’s very unhealthy, and very painful, for men to want sex and then to despise the women they have sex with outside of their marriage. It means men tend to ide women against each other. We are either virgins and wives, or we are whores.”Coon can reel off a long list of male artists who’ve painted brothels, from Toulouse-Lautrec to Picasso – so many, in fact, that she says we barely notice them doing it. So why shouldn’t she? “After all, I kind of know what I’m talking about.” She smiles. “Those people were both the artists and the whore-fuckers. Well, I was the artist and also the whore.”This gets to the core of Coon’s art. She may be the great offender, but often she’s simply flipping perspectives on common narratives. In Rush Hour: She Strips Them Naked With Her Eyes, the men ogling naked bodies in the tabloids on their way to work are simply shown stripped naked themselves. Any offence caused by her work simply exposes our own hypocrisy. That was certainly the case when Tate Liverpool chose not to show her painting Mr Olympia, a pastiche of Manet’s reclining nude Olympia, because its subject had a semi-erect penis. Coon is still campaigning for the things she believes in – including fighting the criminalisation of sex work, which she believes does untold harm to society. “Most of the men and women I speak to are using pornography – which comes from sex work – so to me it’s anathema that you will use the workers for your orgasmic pleasure and then not support them as workers like you would teachers or nurses.”She also remains committed to the legalisation of drugs and an end to the racist stop and search laws that she says are creeping back, since the recent rise in violent crime in London. Her famous photograph of the Clash that adorned their debut single White Riot – the band with their backs turned, their hands up against a wall – was recently repurposed by Release for a campaign against a law that it says makes black youth eight times more likely to be searched.It’s a coming together of all of Coon’s interests – punk, politics, painting – and a reminder that she’s managed to be present at so many countercultural moments. She says her political commitment is what led the punks to adopt her, but you suspect that her inbuilt ability to offend might have helped too. “There I was, the offensive hippy, arguing with Joe Strummer,” she laughs. “But actually there was this wonderful dialogue between the generations taking place. ‘Caroline you failed, you boring hippy.’ ‘No Joe, this is how it really was.’ ‘Well we’re going to do things differently.’” How does she compare those legendary movements to today’s generation? “I love this generation,” she says. “They may have to fight a war again. But as I see it, young people are very active and it’s just the establishment that refuses to recognise that. They like to say they’re apathetic and not getting engaged, but that’s never true. The next 10 years will be fascinating and it probably needs a Putin and a Trump to make people sit up and realise the fight isn’t over.”She pauses and adds: “I just really hope I’m still around to see it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7278a693c8091c44d4ebfe6ea2b6c47d03495cb5/0_251_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=909059cd86a243db8962afce150ca4ce","title":"may day celebrations in glastonbury in pictures","story":"Although more synonymous with International Workers’ Day and Labour Day, May Day, or Beltane, is celebrated by druids and pagans as the beginning of summer.

Kerry MacPhee, who heads community liaison, told locals that one of the windfarms could be 200 metres (650ft) tall, with the other 187 metres, up from 150 metres and 145 metres previously.That would be taller than the UK’s largest existing onshore turbine (193.5 metres) and be on a par with some of the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines, which are 60 metres taller than the London Eye.MacPhee said the potential changes were designed to increase the projects’ chances of winning future auctions for low-carbon electricity and unlock “substantial benefits for Lewis”.EDF said it was likely, but not guaranteed, that fewer turbines would be needed than the original 36 planned. Bigger turbines would also require a new application for planning approval, allowing opponents a chance to air their opinions.Critics remain unimpressed, however. Four crofting groups have been battling EDF’s proposal, arguing that local people would benefit more if the island’s wind resource was harnessed by community-owned turbines.Rhoda MacKenzie, a spokesperson for the crofters, said: “It’s going to have a detrimental effect on tourism. The largest wind turbines in the UK? I hardly think that’s going to bring people here.”Calum Macdonald, a former MP who backs an expansion of community-owned wind power, said the turbine size was staggering. EDF has said there would be no case for more community windfarms without a new power cable to the mainland. The estimated £780m investment needed for such an interconnector would only be justified by electricity generation on the scale proposed by EDF.After several years of not backing support for any onshore windfarms, the government last year threw its weight behind schemes built on remote islands such as Lewis. Wind power developers fighting in auctions for government subsidies across Europe are increasingly dependent on scale to win contracts by bidding with the lowest subsidy price. The next UK auction is scheduled for spring 2019.Will Collins, the project manager for EDF’s Lewis wind power venture, said: “We want to assess the potential for us to consider using larger turbines in order to make the projects as competitive as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cac31d6fcb265f63f247b58568cbde9e1da7b168/0_331_3661_2197/master/3661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41cd1cbc4bbb97b9ddcd0a4885d4852f","title":"tsb questions mps it meltdown eurozone economy uk construction business live","story":"All the day’s economic and financial news, including a parliamentary hearing on TSB’s banking woes and a new healthcheck on Europe’s economy Some TSB customers are fuming this morning after it emerged that the bank had failed to execute their standing orders yesterday.The blunder affected important bills, such as monthly rent payments, set to be paid at the start of the new month.Scientist Stacey Bell found herself caught up in the mess, when her rent found its way back into her account:TSB says the issue has been fixed - but it has created further anxiety among its customers:Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Twelve days ago, TSB pressed the button to switch its 5 million customers onto a shiny new IT platform.

Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George TownAsia is growing. Literally. From Malaysia to Dubai, luxury developments are rising on artificial islands and coastlines. Everybody wins – except the local sea life and the fishermen who depend on itby Wade Shepard in George Town“Before, there were many fish,” says fisherman Mohd-Ishak Bin Abdul Rahman as he pulls a dried up crab from his net. A few years ago he could just walk out into the surf and pick up crustaceans with his bare hands, he tells me. “Now, nothing.”He blames the palisade of new luxury condominiums that rise on the coastline behind him. Built on 240-acres of land artificially reclaimed from the sea, they are part of the Seri Tanjung Pinang 1 (STP1) project. Started in 2006, it brought a taste of new Asian modernity to what was then a rural area beyond the fringes of George Town, Penang’s only city. It also took away the fish, says Mohd-Ishak.The 72-year-old is the undisputed chief of Tanjong Tokong, a fishing village of 100 houses built by the community a few decades ago. He is also the leader of a movement of fishermen protesting against development projects they claim are destroying the island’s fisheries, and with them their livelihoods.Mohd-Ishak says his family has been fishing the area for at least five generations. As we talk, shirtless fishermen watch cautiously from handmade hammocks, half-broken plastic chairs and pieces of junk that washed up on the shore.The contrast between the village with its shacks built from planks, beams and drift wood and the condos, swimming pools, luxury mall and Irish-themed pub is extreme.Now the second phase of the STP project is in full swing. Dredgers, barges, bulldozers and diggers operated by a local subsidiary of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) are busy creating 1,000 more acres of land for luxury development. Slated for completion in 15 years, the STP2 development is expected to have an eventual value of $4.4bn.Land reclamation is nothing new in Asia – China, Hong Kong and Japan have been at it since the 19th century – but it has recently reached epidemic proportions. Maritime ecosystems are abruptly transformed as natural islands are artificially conjoined with coastlines, natural shorelines are extended and artificial islands are built from scratch.Cities on China’s coast reclaimed an average of 700 square kilometres of land – that’s about the size of Singapore – from the sea every year from 2006 to 2010 for new houses, industrial zones and ports. The 130 sq km of land that was reclaimed to build the new city of Nanhui was significant enough to reconfigure China’s national map, and the reclaimed land for the Caofeidian economic zone was twice the size of Los Angeles.Concerned these megaprojects were getting out of control and doing irreparable harm to the environment, Beijing stepped in earlier this year and put an end to land reclamation projects that were not spearheaded by central government.Meanwhile, many Asian cities are picking up where China left off. Besides the STP projects on Penang, Malaysia has massive reclamation works under way for the 700,000-person Forest City in Johor the Philippines is reclaiming 1,010 acres from the sea for its New Manila Bay – City of Pearl Cambodia is building a slew of Chinese-financed properties on reclaimed land Dubai has turned reclamation into an art form and Sri Lanka is building a new financial district on the dredged and deposited land of Colombo International Financial City. Around a quarter of modern-day Singapore was open sea when the nation state came into existence in 1955.Apart from acting as geopolitical flash points – reclamation in the South China Sea is repeatedly bringing the region to the brink of conflict – sourcing the sand is a major problem. Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Vietnam have already banned the export of sand, with reports of a multibillion dollar black market run by organised crime syndicates. Some of Indonesia’s Riau Islands have mysteriously disappeared – loaded on to barges and shipped to nearby Singapore, reports suggest. The verdant, hilly island of Penang has been gripped by a development boom since the historic centre of George Town was declared a Unesco world heritage site in 2008. As tourists poured in from all over the world, so too did prospective property buyers looking to take advantage of the Malaysia My Second Home programme, and floods of east Asian real estate speculators.“Penang has this obsession with wanting to become like Hong Kong and Singapore,” explains Andrew Ng Yew Han, a local film-maker who has documented Penang’s development.The state government’s crosshairs soon fell upon the other natural feature hemming in their ambitions: the sea. Taking a trick from the playbooks of their model cities, Hong Kong and Singapore, Penang launched several large-scale reclamation initiatives – many strategically placed in prime locations.This ability to home in on high-value sections of cities to reclaim land for new development often produces incredible profits. Research from Ocean University of China professor Liu Hongbin found that land reclamation in China can produce a 10- to 100-fold profit.“If you are confident that you can sell the properties at a high price, which is likely the case at the fringe of large coastal cities or in popular coastal tourism destinations, reclaiming the land from scratch could potentially be more profitable than building on extremely expensive existing land,” explains Matthias Bauer, an urban designer who has worked on reclamation projects in China. However, there is a lot more at stake with these projects than the money that is invested in them. Not only are the fishermen of Tanjong Tokong banned from entering what was once an extremely productive fishing ground but there are now fewer fish in the waters near their village. Mohd-Ishak claims his catches have halved since development began.Walking with him down the beach, another fisherman calls me over to his small house. His name is Haron Din, and his torso and legs are covered in the traditional tattoos that many fishermen in south-east Asia once wore. At his feet lie piles of torn up old nets. He pulls out a dried up crab and explains it was dead long before it got tangled in his net. “The mud from the project suffocates them,” he says.Holding a shiny new white net next to one of the 40 or so damaged ones littering the beach, Din complains that mud from the nearby reclamation area is killing the local marine life and doing irreparable damage to their fishing equipment.The fishermen must travel further out to sea to find fish, which drastically increases both the cost of petrol and the dangers of the job. Unable to make a living in their sheltered bay, they now have to cross a busy shipping lane and contend with higher waves. There have already been a few deaths, Mohd-Ishak says.Mageswari Sangaralingam, a research officer for Friends of the Earth Malaysia, says the thousands of sq km of land reclaimed across coastal Asia has meant the annihilation of mangroves, wetlands and reefs – destroying the habitats and breeding grounds for fish, sea turtles, crustaceans, plants and other marine life. In addition, the new cities, transport hubs and industrial zones built on the new land inevitably create added pollution and waste, he says.“The multimillion-ringgit fisheries sector here on which thousands depend is being traded off for development,” says Sangaralingam. “Fish are being wiped out, and the fishermen will soon be too as they lose fishing grounds.”“You have this development and yet people are losing their jobs,” adds film-maker Han. “You have reclamation which promised development, but you have fishermen who are losing their livelihoods, looking for second jobs … You build so many buildings here but in the end it doesn’t belong to us, it will be bought up by other people and foreigners.”I visit Straits Quay – the high-end shopping mall surrounded by luxury condos overlooking the fishing village. On three trips here I’ve never seen anyone actually shopping in its luxury boutiques. The hallways are bare wind tunnels and even the giant atrium that acts as an opulent entranceway to the mall appears desolate, echoing the caws of resident crows and little else. If it wasn’t for a few stragglers slipping in and out to pick up groceries at the small supermarket – and the yacht owners drinking on the patio of the Irish-themed pub – the place could be called a ghost mall.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d701fce77715f908c8609a69e5c296606126b4/529_1010_2312_1387/master/2312.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5f83b9ae8c5a597a0c49fd577a2fdc","title":"black tories windrush conservatives government british","story":"Not long ago, black Conservatives would invoke the name Windrush in a positive context, as evidence of how far the Tories had come since the bad old days of overt racism. “When Empire Windrush arrived at the docks of Tilbury … there was a clear split. Labour embraced migrants … the Tories, not so much … Things are changing,” said one young black Tory in safer times, in 2015.Most of the black Tories I know are of African heritage and were raised with values that emphasise enterprise, faith, family and social conservatism. (For me, the conundrum has never been why there are black Conservatives at all, but why there aren’t more.) They have adopted a worldview in which racism – both within British society and the Tory party in particular – is largely a thing of the past. This has enabled them to create a mental ide between the party’s social and economic values, which they like, and its dodgy history on race. Their emphasis has been on personal responsibility and enterprise, rather than structural barriers to advancement.The last two Conservative prime ministers both made bold statements about their commitments toward eradicating these barriers. David Cameron, branding it “disgraceful” that a young black girl had to change her name to Elizabeth before she was invited to job interviews, for example and Theresa May, in her stance on stop and search, and the launch of her race audit.But the struggle to reconcile those warm words with the Windrush scandal has, perhaps not surprisingly, sent my black Tory acquaintances into a bout of soul-searching. “Better inside the tent looking out than outside the tent looking in,” one – a successful banker – told me. He then, somewhat mournfully, sent me the  article that Margaret Thatcher’s former speechwriter Derek Laud wrote on why the treatment of the Windrush generation made him glad he had left the party. Another black Tory told me, as if trying to convince herself: “Imagine how much worse it would be if there were no black people in the party.”I can’t imagine that, actually. How much worse could it be? We have a foreign secretary who has a long and distinguished track record of the crudest racist remarks – and the comments he published as editor of the Spectator about Caribbean people “multiplying like flies” are particularly painful to read in the light of current events. We have a litany of racist comments by activists, councillors and MPs. The last Conservative London mayoral campaign was so toxic that other Tories sought to distance themselves from it. And even when alerted to the Windrush injustices, May’s instinct was not to meet Caribbean leaders.Yes, there has been racism in the Labour party too, and it is currently – as has been widely reported – battling antisemitism in its ranks. The left has had a lazy\u0026nbsptendency to caricature black Tories as sellouts, while enjoying a historical sense of entitlement towards\u0026nbspthe black vote – an attitude that has its own imperialist connotations.Yet on the right there is a tendency to manipulate black conservatism to paper over a history of appalling racism and discrimination. Even the most conservative Conservatives have shocking stories of treatment within their own party, both at national and local level. Most do not speak about them publicly, although the former party chair Sayeeda Warsi’s rare account of the prejudice she experienced as a Muslim in the party is sobering. When a young black man close to me went to enquire about local party membership not long ago, they assumed he was there to deliver their pizza.But politics should be about policy, not the behaviour of rogue bigots, who can be found on all sides of the political spectrum. And that’s why the Conservative track record on immigration is so hard to reconcile. The new home secretary, Sajid Javid, for example, has a well-known backstory, beloved by Conservatives, of hard-earned success after his father’s arrival in the UK with just £1 to his name. Yet this story could not happen today, because Javid’s own party would not let his father into the country.The families of the MPs Kwasi Kwarteng, Sam Gyimah and Adam Afriyie, one or both of whose parents came, as my mother did, from Ghana having been British subjects under the empire, would – had they achieved the unlikely feat of making it into the country under today’s immigration policies – have found themselves in the nightmare of the Tories’ own hostile environment.It’s this hypocrisy that black Conservatives, on both sides of the Atlantic, struggle to shake off. The conviction of Bill Cosby for aggravated indecent assault against one woman – though he has more than 50 accusers – is bitter justice for a man whose message was, “Do as I say, not as I do”. Cosby, like black British Tories, blamed absent black fathers, shameless single mothers, black culture and rap music – not structural racism and injustice – for America’s creation of a black underclass. Substitute Cosby’s critique of “rap” for British Tories’ critique of “grime” and it all sounds very familiar.In the House of Commons on his first day in his new role, Javid told his shadow, Diane Abbott, that she did not have a “monopoly” on either being the descendant of migrants, or feeling anger and pain at the way some have been treated. And he’s right. But his party is fast earning itself a reputation for having a monopoly over treating British people of colour as less than British, indeed as less than human. And that will reverberate not just among people like me, who already fundamentally distrust the Tories, but many black and brown Brits who once did."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6061f5a1bb13edaadc8392483fccd74a29aeb39/1_0_5258_3155/master/5258.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d0f5de834cc50799111a70d4f3bdf2d","title":"election labour corbyn left thursday","story":"Corbyn’s opponents are desperate to revive the doomed left narrative. Galvanising voters on Thursday will deny them thatAs local elections approach, the danger of overconfidence becomes a very real one for Labour. A year ago the Tories were sure they would snuff Labour out as an electoral force instead Corbynism deprived Theresa May of a majority, ending a neoliberal consensus that had prevailed for a generation. The result left the party membership and much of its support base exuberant. Yet the Labour party, nationally and at London level, is guilty of failing to manage expectations. Despite recent government chaos over the Windrush scandal, Labour has spent the last few weeks in a defensive posture against a media onslaught that has undoubtedly had an impact.Yes, polls suggest Labour is on course to win the best results of any party in the capital for more than 40 years. But George Osborne’s London Evening Standard and No 10’s spin doctors have hyped up the prospect of Conservative Armageddon – hoping to frighten Tory voters to polling stations, suppress the Labour vote through complacency, and make any Labour gains seem insufficient. Unless the party’s grassroots turn out to vote, historic prizes will remain out of reach.Labour’s electoral goals would, in a not too distant age, have been seen as otherworldly, and the party’s current challenges nice to have. Westminster, Barnet and Kensington and Chelsea are all Tory citadels in the capital that have never surrendered to the wooing of Labour, and the party has never won a majority in Barnet, not even in the age of the poll tax or a national Conservative meltdown. Wandsworth, in south London, was last in the red column when James Callaghan was prime minister four decades ago: Labour has never amassed the number of wards it needs to win there in one go. One ward Labour needs to gain in Wandsworth to win the council has an average property value of £1.3 million. Labour is seeking to win wards in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea, which are home to Buckingham Palace and Harrods. Outside London, only a third of some councils’ seats are up for grabs, making Portsmouth impossible to win, and Trafford, in Manchester – last held by Labour 15 years ago – extremely challenging.Labour’s big asset, of course, is a mass membership: I’ve spent the last few weeks with Momentum, mobilising thousands of activists as part of a national campaign called Unseat. Many are young people who are campaigning for the first time – such as the 19-year-old daughter of two Norfolk Ukip voters, or 17-year-old Frank, who travels to campaign days from Lewes in East Sussex. This politicisation of young people isn’t covered enough: the idea of teenagers taking trains and buses across the country en masse to canvass in local elections would be far-fetched in my own younger days. This campaigning is particularly critical for Labour. Those most likely to vote are older, white, more affluent people, who strongly lean towards the Tories.A perennial problem is that those suffering most from a broken social order are the most disillusioned about the entire political process. The reach of Corbynism still has limits. In a Westminster tower block, for instance, I meet a man who lives with three others in a one-bedroom flat: the Tory borough won’t rehouse him because there aren’t enough council\u0026nbsphouses. In Trafford, a tired-looking woman in her early 30s opens the door, cradling her baby. She fled\u0026nbspher husband who beat her, and she and her two children now live with her parents in a cramped two-bedroom house, causing huge family tensions again, the council has no stock to rehouse her.Both are disillusioned with politics and had no intention of voting. It takes a prolonged conversation to convince them otherwise. There are younger voters who may spontaneously break out into chants of “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!” but remain distinctly unenthused by local elections. Some have got in touch to ask me what local elections are, which is unsurprising in a country that does so little to educate its citizens about politics.The campaigning is critical for another reason. Labour began the last general election campaign with catastrophic polling. Critical to reversing the party and leader’s poor popularity ratings were the broadcasting impartiality rules, which kicked in after the election was announced, granting Corbyn unfiltered access to the public. The dramatic increase in political interest gave an opening for a social media campaign that reached millions of voters. Combined with a transformative manifesto, the shift in public attitudes in\u0026nbspa six-week campaign was unprecedented.In these elections, Labour has faced a relentless media barrage, with very few sympathisers in the press to challenge it: the party’s enemies are defining it again. Its policies – such as free bus travel for the under-25s, or linking housing affordability to people’s incomes – were covered in the press, but received no broadcast coverage. National media have shown extremely limited interest in the elections, leaving it off the radar for many. Doorstep campaigning therefore takes on a particularly critical function, both bypassing a hostile media and raising awareness that there are even elections on.But there are profound challenges to Momentum’s mass canvasses. Such campaigning is sometimes chaotic, and outside the mass campaign days complacency can stalk. “Data is good in terms of Labour promises but canvass days are tiny, as are members signed up to door-knock on election day,” says one councillor in Wandsworth. “Just nowhere near the same numbers as the general election. I think the membership are on a high, and think things are all good,\u0026nbspbut they don’t realise how important getting out\u0026nbspthe vote is for locals, due to turnout.”I’m told that Tory core voters are fired up, fearing a clean sweep by the red menace, while many Labour supporters are relatively uninterested in local elections. In Wandsworth the local party believes that it could have enough promises to win the council – but fears it doesn’t\u0026nbsphave enough activists to turn out the vote on election day. Such warnings sometimes require a healthy scepticism: on the evening of the general election, one senior Tooting Labour figure texted me to warn that turnout was rocketing in Tory areas and suppressed in Labour’s. A few hours later the Labour majority surged from less than 3,000 to 15,458. But local Labour fears about turnout on the ground are genuine.Barnet, in north London, is home to Britain’s biggest Jewish population, many of whom feel angry about, and fearful of, the left’s antisemitic fringe. At a general election, Labour could get voters’ attention with promises to end austerity, scrap tuition fees, introduce a\u0026nbspliving wage and bring utilities under public ownership. Commitments in local elections are inevitably more modest, which makes arousing enthusiasm more challenging. Labour is making pledges to use local powers, for instance, to challenge the housing crisis, but the devastating government-imposed cuts limit the party’s ability to match the radicalism of its national policy commitments. In addition, Brexit is an understandably emotive subject among citizens of the European Union who are entitled to vote.Media smears, too, can land: one middle-aged voter in Trafford, previously Labour, yelled at me that Jeremy Corbyn was a Russian spy who would make the tsar ruler of the country, and that he needed “shooting”. It is a reminder that the media is fuelling dangerous radicalisation.Corbyn’s opponents – the Tories, the press,\u0026nbspand within the Labour party – are desperate to turn the clock back on the last general election result – to\u0026nbsprestore a narrative that the left is a doomed, delusional cult. They may be attempting to set the party ludicrously high standards in the local elections to justify another round of attacks. Labour will undoubtedly do well. But without a determined push against complacency, and to mobilise the party’s base, the great Tory prizes will remain out of reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5af2d5e74394b6c532b4768b0074c47c81a0fc21/0_284_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7bb09064e94b3e2ca0efbe2894306f51","title":"vegans top sports stars you asked google autocomplete","story":"Veganism and sport might seem like unlikely bed-mates but a burgeoning number of athletes appear to be turning to it in a bid to avoid injury or recover more quickly from training. It’s a curious thing when a Premier League footballer such as Arsenal’s Héctor Bellerín embraces a plant-based diet in a bid to improve his fitness. Mostly met with scepticism, Bellerín’s solution to an ankle injury that had prevented him from playing was one that involved eliminating animal products and fuelling up on wholefoods instead. Despite the naysayers, it seems to have done the trick, allowing the Spaniard to return to his pre-injury form but not without ruffling a few feathers in the process.With veganism on the rise then, why are many professional athletes still so averse to accepting that adopting a plant-based diet might just give them that desired edge? One club that does understand the power of a plant-based diet is Forest Green Rovers, who have opted to keep their collective diets entirely animal-product-free during training. To many people’s surprise, the team recently got promoted to the football league for the first time in their 128-year history, leading people to wonder whether veganism had played a part in their success.Endurance athlete extraordinaire Rich Roll might just have a few answers when it comes to linking a plant-based lifestyle to increased performance, listing some of the obvious benefits as being able to maintain weight, as well as expeditiously furthering the body’s ability to repair exercise-induced stress. Named as one the world’s 25 fittest men by Men’s Fitness magazine and at 52 still taking on challenges that would make people half his age wince, Roll’s approach to training involved swapping his penchant for pepperoni pizza to veggies, lentils and “tons of greens”.Speaking from his home in the Malibu hills, the author of Finding Ultra said: “I think many would be surprised to learn that I don’t excel athletically\u0026nbspdespite\u0026nbspmy plant-based diet, but\u0026nbspbecause of it ... Many people think I must be eating gigantic amounts of food daily. I have found that to not be the case. In addition to being highly adapted to the training load I endure, the foods I eat are so nutritionally dense that I don’t require the calorific density one might imagine. In other words, I do better with less.”And it’s not just the immediate gains athletes are now concerned with but also their long-term health. With many athletes succumbing to heart failure at a young age, are the new generation now thinking ahead, hoping to avoid the same fate as many of their peers? Some cases are indeed congenital (or the result of high-intensity exertion, which can lead to structural, functional and electrical changes to the heart) but that doesn’t necessarily mean a plant-based lifestyle can’t have a significant impact in combating chronic disease. Roll explains this was a major factor in his own wholefoods overhaul: “With heart disease in my family lineage, this was a prime motivator for me making the switch back in 2006 ... in addition, eating a wholefood, plant-based diet is the one diet that has been proven to prevent and even reverse a litany of chronic lifestyle illnesses including type-2 diabetes.”Because sugar and processed-food consumption are currently at the forefront of many people’s minds, particularly in the wake of Jamie Oliver’s recent #AdEnough campaign, Roll thinks it’s also pertinent to point out that not all vegan food is healthy. “A wholefood, plant-based diet should not be confused with a vegan diet, which despite being animal-free can or may include processed and other less healthy ingredients.” This might be disappointing news to many who think a tub of dairy-free Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s is tantamount to having a smoothie bowl, but with an increasing array of junk food alternatives on the market, it’s vital to remember that these should be regarded as occasional treats and not something to rely on daily.So, what is the future for veganism in sport and if you are considering making the switch yourself, where exactly should you begin? Roll maintains that while endurance athletes have led the charge when it comes to plant-based eating and performance, many mainstream professionals are now following in their steps, including tennis virtuoso Serena Williams who’s previously claimed her new diet “changed her life”.• Aine Carlin is a vegan food writer and blogger"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c4c1806e9de97e92413a25dd757287d3b882164/0_0_650_391/master/650.jpg?w=940\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eebc4b139e98268bd6316855e387f308 940w","title":"from backstreet eats to five star feasts abu dhabis diverse dining scene","story":"Whether you’re on a blow-out budget or hunting for a bargain, Abu Dhabi has it all.

But levels of contamination vary widely depending on government actions and financial resources.But these gains were set against a worsening trend in other regions.Delhi and Cairo are by far the most polluted mega-cities in the world with average PM10 levels more than 10 times the WHO guidelines. They are followed by Dhaka, Mumbai and Beijing, each with particulate concentrations about five times the recommended level.In terms of household air pollution, which contributed to 3.8m deaths, the gap is also wide because families in poorer nations are more dependent on burning wood, coal and kerosene for cooking and heating.Overall, the authors said the global annual death toll of 7 million is largely unchanged from the previous 2016 air pollution report by the WHO, despite growing awareness of the problem and government promises of action.Reducing these risks depends on public awareness and political will, as well as income. The authors of the report praised China, which has tightened pollution controls in the wake of “airpocalypse” scandals, public protests and health concerns.“One of the reasons for that, is the health argument is strongly presented and citizens felt the link between air pollution and their own health,” said Dr Maria Neira, director of public health at WHO. “We’d like to see the same movement now in India, which is a country of particular concern.”There are signs of progress from specific projects, such as India’s Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana scheme which has provided 37 million women living below the poverty line with free liquified petroleum gas connections, and Mexico City, which has committed to cleaner vehicle standards. More cities are also measuring air quality, which is pushing the subject up the political agenda.But there is much to be done, even in wealthy nations with relatively progressive policies. The new data reveals 49 towns and cities in the UK – ranging from London and Manchester to Prestonpans and Eccles – are at or over WHO standards for PM2.5. Jenny Bates, Friends of the Earth air pollution campaigner, said this showed the need for more research and stronger policies.“As more air quality data becomes available, we are uncovering a deeply concerning number of seemingly quaint, fresh aired places across the UK with dangerously polluted air,” she said.But the overall picture is clear. WHO says the threat remains enormous across the globe with the worst impacts hitting the poor.“Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalised people bear the brunt of the burden,” says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of WHO. “It is unacceptable that over 3 billion people – most of them women and children – are still breathing deadly smoke every day from using polluting stoves and fuels in their homes. If we don’t take urgent action on air pollution, we will never come close to achieving sustainable development.”As well as governments, WHO are encouraging iniduals to do more to reduce air pollution with a campaign to promote greater use of public transport and bicycles."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c85c4cff78b2165dfda780ba631ac1bde6b9148/14_150_4373_2624/master/4373.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea5e09078ff93c68314ab87649e8a15","title":"harry kane fa tweet england spurs","story":"• Tottenham striker says other nations would not belittle players• Kane will not leave social media despite actions of minorityHarry Kane has said the Football Association was silly to poke fun at his performance in Tottenham’s FA Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester United and questioned why people feel the need to mock England players before the World Cup.The striker was kept quiet by United’s Chris Smalling at Wembley and after the game, which United won 2-1, the official FA Cup account tweeted: “What’s that in your pocket, Chris?” and linked to an unrelated video of the defender saying: “Harry Kane.”The tweet was deleted and the FA apologised to Tottenham and United “for any offence caused”. Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham’s manager, branded the game’s governing body an embarrassment last week. Kane is relaxed about the issue but he pointed out it was an odd way for the FA to treat one of its own.“The FA tweet was a silly tweet,” Kane said. “We all know that. I talked to the gaffer about it and all we said was: ‘Would other countries do that to their players?’ Probably not.“It is something that has gone. Two weeks ago now or whatever – I am over it. The gaffer may have said I am sad but I am focused. I am a guy that gets over things. If it happened, it happened. I move on and look forward to the next game and that is all I worry about.”Kane, who scored his 38th goal of the season in Tottenham’s 2-0 win over Watford on Monday, added that England players receive too much flak at times.“It’s strange,” he said. “Maybe it’s a mentality thing. It is easier nowadays maybe to banter England players or take the mickey out of the England players. So if we don’t do well in the World Cup, then they can write and say: ‘We told you so.’ But that is maybe a weaker mentality.“It is what it is. We are focusing on what we have got to do. We have got to go with the mindset and belief we can do it. We try to win everything we go into. The World Cup is no different.”Kane has been the butt of a few jokes since fighting to be credited with a goal that brushed off him against Stoke on 7 April. However he has no plans to step away from social media.“On social media you get a few people who don’t see eye to eye and it is being a fan and having an opinion,” he said. “I will always engage with my fans. It is just a small number of fans who maybe go over the mark but that is just life. You cannot get too down about that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db12fd1128e63e30b30cab2945c7d88c8516a93d/0_204_3067_1840/master/3067.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14af96f54b4fc3a83ad0dc562de0a200","title":"real madrid bayern munich champions league match report","story":"Real Madrid always find a way, they say, and somehow they did – all the way to a third consecutive European Cup final. For so long, they had the Bavarians at the gates, the Bernabéu gripped by fear, but when a long, wild, tense and often inexplicable match was over and the siege subsided at last, there they were, still standing. A goal down after three minutes, Real were not safe until the very end but it is they, not Bayern Munich, who made it to Kiev. The world’s biggest club, 12 times winners of this competition, finalists for the fourth time in five years, are also its greatest survivors.“The European Cup releases special powers in Real Madrid,” Toni Kroos had said it does something to their opponents too. For Bayern, 39 shots over two legs proved less decisive than three gifts, each greater than the last. This time it was Corentin Tolisso’s back pass and Sven Ulreich’s moment of panic that cost them, an error that lent credence to Franz Beckenbauer’s suggestion that Bayern have a “complex” when it comes to Real. And yet for a long time it appeared they might overcome even that.The problem was that standing before them, ing before them too, were the team who know that to resist is to win, making a virtue of suffering, a word Zinedine Zidane uses often. This time they suffered like never before: when one last ball was sent into Real’s area, desperate whistles bursting ear drums, the clock beyond 95 minutes, they might have wondered if for once fate would be cruel. Instead, the ball escaped Thomas Müller, the referee blew for the last time and the roar rocked this place. Ulreich sat distraught and alone on the turf as the noise engulfed everything. “That’s how Real win!” they chanted, but how, exactly? Real win because, well, Real win. Even when they don’t actually win. It finished 2-2 but those two goals from Karim Benzema were enough. A 2-1 win in Munich had allowed it, the tie finishing 4-3 on aggregate.It had been a long night. Zidane had said the key was “not to take a step back, not to try to hang on to the result, but to go for it from the start”, but in the end hanging on was what they did. Jupp Heynckes insisted the first leg showed Real could be hurt and it was his side who began on the front foot, swiftly levelling the aggregate score. When Joshua Kimmich struck from close range it was not even the first time Bayern had ventured into the Real area. James Rodríguez playing deep, finding space, red shirts seemingly outnumbering white, the balance tilted Bayern’s way. But hurting Real is one thing, killing them another.Although Marcelo’s superb cross was headed in by Karim Benzema to make it 1-1 in the 11th minute, Bayern had always needed two anyway and continued to press. In a match that was marked by missed opportunities, the most astonishing came after half an hour. Mats Hummels went past three and slipped the ball into the area for Robert Lewandowski, alone. His shot looped up off Keylor Navas and Müller leapt to head goalwards, the ball hitting Marcelo’s back. It dropped to Rodríguez, who volleyed over from three yards.Soon after that Cristiano Ronaldo forced a save from Ulreich, a reminder of the risk and Bayern must have felt that they needed another goal before half-time. The Bernabéu, whistling for the half to end, certainly feared one. Tolisso curled over and then Marcelo handled before Lewandowksi forced a corner. Hummels headed wide. The chance, it seemed, was gone.Thirty seconds into the second half, it seemed it really had. Tolisso played the back-pass blind and Ulreich froze, wanting to pick it up before realising he could not and effectively just sitting down, collapsing and allowing the ball to escape him. Benzema, barely able to believe it, strolled past to score – another “gift” to add to the two Heynckes lamented in the first leg.David Alaba’s shot was pushed away by Navas and then Lewandowski tumbled, challenged by Sergio Ramos, as Bayern kept coming. White bodies were on the line, just like in the first leg, roars accompanying every block, save and header. Tolisso could not force home and, on the hour, first Thiago Alcântara and then Lewandowski fired goalwards, before the equaliser arrived. James volleyed Niklas Süle’s cross, reacted swiftly to the rebound and guided under Navas. A former Real player, he did not celebrate but high in the north stand the German fans did.They were just a goal away now, the game on a knife edge. But if there is a team capable of living on the edge, it is Real. Tolisso connected with a volley six yards out and Navas made a superb save.It was the 18th shot Bayern had had, one more even than in the first leg, yet still they trailed. The deliveries from the left were endless – from one, Navas scrambled away Müller’s header and from another he punched clear. A scramble was hacked clear and in the fourth minute of added time Navas saved once more.Time slipped away, hearts raced and one last cross was played in, once more into the fray. Müller launched himself at it but the ball evaded him, taking the final with it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941daefdb07464da176d9b076e37d10b5895d563/392_380_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ddd757488c615e05ed65549a4675c7e","title":"six of the best one pot meals","story":"Cut down on the washing-up with these all-in-one dishes, including pork ribs with dumplings, chard gratin and Korean beef stew6 tbsp olive oil3 red onions, peeled and finely chopped5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped3 carrots, roughly chopped2 heads celery, outer branches removed, hearts roughly chopped1 bunch parsley leaves, roughly chopped5 tbsp tinned chopped tomatoes1 bunch cavolo nero, chopped500g cooked borlotti beans, cooking liquor reserved¾ loaf stale white bread or ciabatta, crust removed, cut into 2.5cm thick wedgesPlenty of good olive oil 600ml boiling waterSalt and black pepperIn a large heavy-based pot, fry the onions, garlic, carrots, celery and parsley uncovered in the olive oil for about one hour over a low heat.When these are entirely soft, add the tomatoes and continue to cook for a further 15 minutes.

Season the ribs with salt and pepper and brown them really well over a high heat in batches, so they colour nicely. Set aside with any juices. Don’t wipe the pan out.Add the potatoes to the pan and brown well all over. Add the onion, lower the heat and sweat for 10 minutes or until soft. Add the apple juice or wine, and deglaze the pan. Put the meat and juices back in the pan and add enough water to cover. Add the bay leaf, season, and cook over a low heat for two hours, or until the meat falls off the bones.Meanwhile, make the dumpling dough. Put the kefir or yoghurt, sunflower oil, vinegar, sugar and salt in a large bowl, and mix with a fork. Mix the flour with the bicarbonate of soda, then sift into the kefir mixture and mix in to a soft, pillowy dough. If it’s still slightly sticky, heavily flour your work surface and start kneading the dough, incorporating more flour into it. The dough should stop sticking to your hands when it’s ready but also remain soft. Divide the dough into four.Roll out each piece of dough on a floured surface into a 2mm rectangle. Add a tablespoon of the sunflower oil, rub all over with your hand, roll into thick sausages and cut each dough sausage into 5cm discs. You should end up with about 35 dumplings. Now check how much liquid there is in the stew. It should be still wet, but not too much. You want your dumpling bottoms to absorb some of the juices but their tops should steam.Turn up the heat under the stew. My gran used to call this ‘breathing strength’ into it. It should be boiling like crazy. Now swiftly but gently put the dumplings into the stew and cover, securing with a wet tea towel if steam escapes, so put a folded wet tea towel around the rim of the lid if you see steam escaping. Cook on high for 15 minutes, then lower and cook for another 30.

But how can you stop wasting your life in pointless meetings? Here’s an expert guideSome human inventions flash into being, get a little polish and then are pretty much left alone, their users generally satisfied, or at least not so dissatisfied that they attempt to come up with an alternative. No one tries to build a better hankie, a more comforting cuddle or a dinner plate “that really works”. Yet the search for the perfect business meeting seems never-ending. The caravan instead of the boardroom, the rubber chicken that bestows the right to speak: you name it, it has been tried and generally found to suck. Now Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, has had a go, creating what he calls “the weirdest meeting culture you will ever encounter”.Weird? Maybe, though other words that spring to mind include “anal” and “stultifying”. As Bezos told the audience at the George W Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, he has banned the PowerPoint presentations that dominate most commercial meetings. Instead, some poor devil must spend a week or more preparing “a six-page, narratively structured memo” full of “real sentences” rather than bullet points. Everyone else must then spend the first half-hour of the meeting silently – and publicly – pondering it, before moving on to a debate. Bezos calls this “a kind of study hall”.“Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely,” Bezos admits. “Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum …”If this sounds like your idea of hell, don’t panic. Some of the finest minds in business are working on alternatives.“This is quite pervasive in organisations now,” says Prof André Spicer from Cass Business School at City, University of London. “They might ask people to reflect for a few minutes in a meeting before making a decision. Or they’ll ask people to turn inwards, and think about what their own feelings are telling them.” Evidence suggests that injecting more mindfulness can help alleviate inidual anxiety, and help people focus better in meetings and lose the irrelevant information.“The danger of it, though,” says Spicer, “is that it gets treated as a way to cover up more systemic issues. I’ve been working with the Department of Health, which introduced a mindfulness programme to deal with health and wellness issues in the department. The truth was that the problems there were with endemic restructuring and extreme working hours – the mindfulness just extended meetings and the working day.”“The death of the long lunch is a tragedy for businesses,” says Spicer. “Many organisations had lunch together in cafeterias where everyone stopped and ate together and talked. There is research by Humanize, which studies social networks and work, that shows that people who go to lunch and sit in fairly large groups tend to do a lot better in the company, simply because they are building up networks and finding out what is going on in the business. Bring back lunch!”Actually, says Emma Sinclair, the co-founder of EnterpriseAlumni, there is a lot to be said for the regular company-wide catchup, even if it comes in the form of a traditional meeting. “People do need to feel included. And a bit of consistency is good.”“One PayPal executive, David Sacks, used to burst into meeting rooms like a prohibition-era cop and ask what people were meeting about,” says Bruce Daisley, the European vice-president at Twitter and the host of the Eat Sleep Work Repeat podcast. “If it wasn’t any good, he would stop the meeting right then and there. I love this idea of superhero-style vigilantes closing meetings down. Imagine if the burden of having a meeting was that at any point you’d have to explain what the meeting was about. Brilliant! If all of us knew we would be held to account for the cost of a meeting and the amount of people’s time we are taking up, our perspective would be different. The meeting is taking all the fun out of our jobs because we are so scared of not being busy. But sitting at your desk and thinking is an important part of the job.”Ever sat in a meeting and wondered how much it was costing the company in terms of salaries? Tools such as Harvard Business Review’s business meeting cost calculator will put a figure on it. Spicer recommends a meeting budget. “If you want to invite a member of staff to your meeting, it will get taken off your budget. The cost of inviting loads of people to come along and listen to a PowerPoint presentation actually becomes valued, and you have to think: ‘Do we actually need this person there?’”Everyone wants meetings to be shorter, but stunts pulled in some workplaces such as making attendees hold the plank, do situps, speak against a timer or put money in a charity box if they overrun are counterproductive and, frankly, irritating. “I’m a bit suspicious of any of that jiggery-pokery,” says Stefan Stern, the co-author of Myths of Management. “That doesn’t feel like work to me. If you’re trying to achieve something from your meeting, you need to be focusing on the meat of the matter.” Rather than your aching muscles, for example.“All this show-and-tell stuff turns the meeting into a spectacle, rather than something productive,” agrees Spicer. However, he adds, standing meetings are effective at cutting meeting times. Walking and talking (favoured by Mark Zuckerberg and Barack Obama) has also been shown to help people work better. “Marily Oppezzo at Stanford University has done a lot of research in this area,” says Daisley. “She shows how meetings can engage ergent thought – so they help people come up with ideas, although not necessarily narrow them down.”“It’s a great idea to get people to check in their phones and laptops,” says Spicer. “Unless they are actually being used, not having them helps people focus their attention on what is actually going on in the room.” That doesn’t mean it’s not awkward, however. “I recently did some work with senior managers at a bank and they were forced to put their phones in sealed envelopes. They were constantly looking over to the cupboard where their phones were. As soon as the first break came, they ripped them open like they were crack addicts who had just seen a bag of crack. But once they had actually got focused on a task, they got a lot more done. One of the basic principles of productivity is that we are terrible at multitasking, so we need to remove as many distractions from meetings as possible.”Another Bezos rule: he won’t call a meeting, or even attend one, where two pizzas couldn’t feed the entire group. “Meetings now are easier than ever to arrange,” says Daisley. This means they can often become “very low-quality exchanges of ideas and powerplay” if they are not considered properly and numbers kept under control. The solution is to “value the introverts”. “Most of modern work has been around celebrating the extrovert – brainstorming meetings, presentations, open-plan offices,” he says. “Performance art has become part of our job. But when you look into how a creative idea is formed, it is normally by inidual thinking and one-to-one conversation. As Susan Cain says in her book Quiet, the truth about the best collaborations is that they are in smaller groups – it’s more Lennon and McCartney than loads of people in an open-plan room.”“Walk out of a meeting or drop off a call as soon as it is obvious you aren’t adding value,” the billionaire CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, has said. “It is not rude to leave it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time.” Of course, it is probably easier to get away with this when you are a fantastically rich company boss rather than an underpaid middle manager.“Is your meeting really necessary?” asks Stern. “As the management consultant Peter Drucker put it, ‘One either meets or one works.’” Daisley says we should abolish half of all meetings. “If you go into a meeting and somebody asks: ‘Has anyone got anything for today’s agenda?’, that should tell you that there is no point to it. We live in a world where the quality of our work is being appraised by others, by our bosses, so we never want to appear as if we’re not working hard. So when a meeting comes up that we are responsible for, we all want to show that we have packed agendas. We need to lose the fear of standing people down for meetings and cancel them.”How do you do it? Maybe cite some evidence. “We’re starting to realise that interruptions and distractions are the curse of getting anything done,” says Daisley. “We need to permit people to have quiet spaces. In Cal Newport’s book Deep Work, he argues that anything of any value is created only by a period of isolated concentration.” Something to send back on your next calendar invite."},{"url":null,"title":"kanye west on slavery for 400 years that sounds like a choice","story":"In a confrontation in the TMZ newsroom, the rapper talks about his view on slavery as well as reaffirming his support for Donald TrumpKanye West has said that 400 years of slavery is “a choice” in a TMZ interview that resulted in a confrontation.The rapper, who has been tweeting out support for Donald Trump in recent weeks, was talking about the president, free thinking and labels before he moved onto slavery.“When you hear about slavery for 400 years,” he said. “For 400 years? That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it’s all of y’all. It’s like we’re mentally in prison. I like the word prison because slavery goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews. Prison is something that unites as one race, blacks and whites, that we’re the human race.”He then proceeded to talk directly to the entire office before TMZ reporter Van Lathan shot back at him for his comments. “I actually don’t think you’re thinking anything,” he said.He continued: “While you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you’ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.” Lathan said he was “unbelievably hurt” about Kanye morphing into something that’s “not real”.West’s comments were met by anger and incredulity on social media.Earlier in the conversation, West reaffirmed his support for Trump calling him his “boy” and explaining why he tweeted a picture wearing a Make America Great Again cap. “I felt a freedom in doing something that everybody tells you not to do,” he said.West’s return to the spotlight has preceded the release of two new albums out in June. The rapper dropped two initial tracks over the past week to a mixed reception.Today also saw the release of an hour-long interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God which saw West say he’s in “a stronger place” than he’s ever been while also expressing hurt over Barack Obama calling him a “jackass”.“Don’t tell the world I’m a jackass,” he said. “I’m fightin’ hard enough. Something about me going on stage was similar to what you was doing. ’Cause I’m fighting to break the simulation, break the setup. That didn’t make no sense.”In the same interview, West also briefly touched upon slavery. “When I saw Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, that’s when I wanted to use bitcoin,” he said. “It’s like all the slave movies. Why you gotta keep reminding us about slavery? Why don’t you put Michael Jordan on the $20 bill?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d619853674bfc614b9ebabe52a0031e72243e12/32_54_1128_677/master/1128.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b40cc8eb25537df4d956ecdf17c9fac","title":"gareth liddiard on the wreckage of the web if i could go back to 1999 i would","story":"Former Drones frontman opens up about past trauma, his new band and his firm belief that smartphones are making us stupidI’m recording this interview with Gareth Liddiard into my laptop, which has a bit of tape over the camera aperture.

In the track The Future of History, he turns the 1996 defeat of the chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov by the supercomputer Deep Blue into an epic battle straight out of Norse mythology: “A 64-bit lightning war … a data-crushing Viking of a Commodore.” He makes the droll observation: “If IBM is here to make your dreams come true  You can probably say the same thing about nightmares too.”The album title links “meatspace” – as Silicon Valley engineers derogatorily refer to the physical realm – with a neurodegenerative disorder called kuru, once found in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea. Men would eat the muscles of the deceased, while women and children ate the brains, thereby inheriting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and pot-holing their own grey matter to such an extent that they lost control of their emotions and laughed themselves to death.Liddiard digs that kind of grim polarity, and he has found a polarity in his new band, too. Other than himself, it’s populated entirely by women: the Drones bassist Fiona Kitschin, guitarist Erica Dunn (Harmony) and drummer Lauren Hammel (High Tension). The female chorus alternating with his gruff vocals make him sound outnumbered and outgunned. This album was recorded at Liddiard and Kitschin’s home in Nagambie, Victoria, and, while it’s intense, there’s also a casualness to it, as though it’s the product of jam sessions and overturned ashtrays. “We’ve watched plenty of DVDs in tracksuit pants,” Liddiard confirms. In the clip for the first single, You Let My Tyres Down, the band are pictured in white robes, regurgitating spag bol in a paddock at dusk before tearing up Lake Nagambie in a speedboat.If that seems a little feral, well, it’s not a mockery of how the other half live. Liddiard says there’s a lot of his own youth in Perth reflected in this song about ram raids, drug use and kids on remand. “The older I’ve gotten, I’ve taken stock – and that’s my story, all that sort of stuff,” he says. “I was given drugs by my stepsister at 13, before she went to jail with her husband for a long time. My cousin was nearly stabbed to death he was a drug dealer. On the flipside my other cousin was nearly killed by fascists because he was a successful lawyer trying to prosecute General Pinochet in Chile.”With both sides of his family “fucked up”, Liddiard finds himself drawn to people with dysfunctional backgrounds, including bandmates past and present. “There are knock-on effects of trauma getting passed on through generations,” he says. “If we got upset our parents would shut that down really quick, so we’d just bottle it up. Birds of a feather flock together we all found each other and got wasted and had a fucking great time.”At school, his best mate – and later a bandmate in the Drones – was Rui Pereira, who had been born during the war of Mozambique, then became a refugee in Rio de Janeiro. “It’s an insanely dangerous place and also where my dad was born and grew up,” Liddiard says. “It left Rui world-class messed up, and we used to laugh and go, ‘Why is this guy so mad?’ Now it’s like, ‘Oh yeah, of course.’”For years, Liddiard kicked around with Rui and his own girlfriend, the Asian-Australian daughter of a PTSD-suffering Vietnam veteran. She wound up dying of a heroin overdose in Liddiard’s car when he was 21, not long after a mate of his had killed himself. “Then I met Fiona. She was newly ex-Mormon, so the good times just kept on with all the drugs and booze,” he says dryly.Liddiard and Kitschin have worked together for 16 years and he credits her with the business acumen. “You don’t get a lot of kudos for that,” he acknowledges. “If she worked with a pop band she’d be a gazillionaire but she’s stuck with us.”It seems an opportune time to ask if he has ever just written a song about his feelings – if only to discard it. “Your worldview is part and parcel with your interior dialogue,” he deflects. “They all get mixed up together. They’re in there.”But let’s get back to the internet, which Liddiard is pointing out humanity survived 200,000 years without. While he reckons Twitter has been useful for LBGTQI+ advocacy and for movements including #MeToo, it’s also damaging the brain, laughing-death style. “There’s all sorts of jargon on the left where people talk in a similar way to AFL footballers, in that they’ve been trained to say this empty bullshit,” he says. “You think in whatever language you speak, and if you can’t understand that language properly, you can’t think properly.”Still, he’s hopeful that the next generation might rebel. “When I moved out of home, my mum suggested I get a TV,” he recalls. “I was like, ‘Why would I get a TV?’ She was like, ‘Why would you not? How are you going to know anything?’” In 2018 it seems quaint to worry about TV being the drug of the nation, but as Liddiard notes, “Her generation couldn’t live without it.”• Tropical Fuck Storm’s debut album A Laughing Death in Meatspace is out on Friday 4 May through TFS Records and Inertia.

Labour would have to take 15 more seats – overturning huge majorities in some – to win control.But many believe that the tide is turning. Labour’s Emma Dent Coad sent shockwaves through the local Tory establishment when she won Kensington at the 2017 general election, primarily on the back of Brexit in one of the most remain-supporting constituencies in the country.Then came the horrors of the Grenfell fire, which killed 71 people, and the woefully inadequate response from the town hall which saw even national Tory politicians heaping on the criticism.Jackie Michael, 57, who has lived in the north of the borough for more than a decade, said: “It is inconceivable that the Tories hang on to the council after the disastrous way they responded to the fire. All you need to do is look up, and you see the tower. It’s a constant symbol of their ineptitude.”But Robert Atkinson, Labour group leader on the council, is cautious. “In the last 12 months we’ve made astonishing progress in all areas of K\u0026ampC and while we may not take the council this time, we’re certainly going to come close to it,” he told the . “But there will be future elections and we will then be starting from a much stronger position.”Party insiders believe the most likely outcome is that it piles on votes in wards it already holds, while picking up a few extra seats in those which are currently split between the two main parties, although not enough to take control. “But we’re fighting seriously in wards where we haven’t fought for years,” said one Labour candidate.They also play down the relevance of Dent Coad’s victory. “It’s not quite as revolutionary as people think,” said one, suggesting the outspoken MP fears she may not win a second time so is keeping her options open by standing again for the council.Momentum has been out in force and, although Corbyn was campaigning in Ladbroke Grove, so far he has stayed away from the south of the borough. “I don’t think it would help if he was seen down the Kings Road,” said one party insider.Back in Chelsea, however, Labour is knocking on some doors it never has before. Activists report that some lifelong Tory voters think the council’s handling of Grenfell has been a disgrace, but concede that the most they can hope for is that they stay at home on Thursday.The local Conservative party was condemned for its insensitivity in November for sending out a questionnaire in one of the richest parts of the borough asking people to rate the importance of Grenfell as an issue alongside rubbish collections and parking.But some voters think that enough is enough. “The council has spent a fortune on big new homes for Grenfell victims. Why are they still complaining? It’s about time the self-flagellation stopped,” said one.Labour is attempting to stir up anti-Brexit sentiment among the thousands of European citizens who live in the borough – many of them in Chelsea - and who make up almost a fifth of the electorate.“Don’t overlook the fury of the Europeans,” said one candidate. “Usually these people don’t think local government matters. So we hope some can be prodded into casting a protest vote.”The biggest issues that come up on the doorstep in this part of the borough, however, are planning and parking. John Miller, 72, a retired accountant, said: “While we all recognise how terrible Grenfell was, I think any council would have struggled to deal with it. I am more likely to judge them on how they look after our public realm and our streets.”Whatever the result, the incoming council is going to look very different to the old one, with 17 Tory councillors not standing for re-election. Some have retired, others have stepped down over the fire and its aftermath.The Tory leader, Elizabeth Campbell, who took over after the fire, has been campaigning “all over the borough”, perhaps mindful of the damage done when she admitted she had never been inside a tower block before Grenfell.She is reluctant to comment on whether the tragedy – or the fact that some victims are still waiting for new permanent homes – will affect her electoral chances. “I can’t predict things. I can only just work as hard as I can, so we will see. Ask me afterwards,” she said in one interview.Daniel Moylan, a former deputy leader of the council who is standing down as councillor this time, is also hedging his bets. “It will be tough for the Conservatives. We could lose some seats but it will be difficult for Labour to take control of the council,” he said. “It would be a political tsunami if we lost. Though, of course, tsunamis do happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b299bd77de0a008f353cc581e3dbf88b5b309143/463_141_1866_1120/master/1866.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8965b776d1a8e978f8201d6eee31e3a","title":"pm tries to hold cabinet together by delaying customs partnership decision","story":"Two options for EU arrangement set to remain on table as 11-strong subcommittee meetsTheresa May will attempt to head off a rebellion of her Brexit inner cabinet and prevent key leave-supporting ministers from resigning by delaying a final decision on her “customs partnership” model.The prime minister is expected to keep both of Downing Street’s options for a future customs arrangement with the European Union on the table at least for now as the 11-strong subcommittee meet for talks on Wednesday.No 10 sources said the prime minister had no plans to “boot out” one customs union option immediately and that officials would continue working on both.However, May faces a tense showdown with key Brexiters, after the  learned that they are planning to “pointedly and forcefully” persuade her to drop her preferred plan altogether.Downing Street has spent the last few days intensely lobbying ministers including David Davis, Liam Fox and Boris Johnson on the benefits of the so-called hybrid model, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels.But the Brexiters now believe they have the numbers to force her hand, claiming that new home secretary Sajid Javid and defence secretary Gavin Williamson would back them, giving them a majority of six to five in the crunch talks.It comes after it emerged that 60 Eurosceptic MPs from the European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, have sent May a 30-page report setting out their opposition to the plan.The group is understood to have repeatedly warned No 10 in recent weeks that the customs partnership would be considered a red line, and crossing it could precipitate the collapse of the government. One remain-supporting cabinet minister told the  earlier that they expected the prime minister to make a “big push” for her preferred option at the meeting, but Whitehall officials suggested she would stop just short of ditching the alternative. Brexiter sources claimed that the prime minister had been told eight times by civil servants that her preferred option, which is backed by her top Brexit civil servant Olly Robbins, was unworkable but has continued to stick with it.The option is regarded as cumbersome and impractical by Brexiters, who describe it as the “unicorn” model and fear it would be “a customs union by the back door”.The customs partnership has become the most contentious issue in the debate about what kind of Brexit should be pursued, with many MPs regarding it as the only way of successfully avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland.Brexiters hope to persuade the prime minister to keep the alternative on the table for now – the maximum facilitation (“max-fac”) proposal, which relies on technology to minimise border checks.Conservative sources suggested Davis could be prepared to resign if the subcommittee throws its weight behind the prime minister’s option. Insiders said he felt “cut out of the loop” and concerned that he had been effectively replaced by Robbins, who is based in Downing Street.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, also put down a marker in a BBC interview, insisting that staying in the customs union in all but name would be unacceptable. He refused to deny that he might be prepared to resign if the government pressed ahead.“That’s worse than the position in which we found ourselves today in the European Union. I don’t think there is a customs union that could ever be acceptable,” he said.“If we are in a customs union of any sort we will have less ability to shape Britain’s future than we have today. That is not what the public voted for.”One cabinet minister suggested that ultimately the government would have to settle for a customs union in all but name. “My more pragmatic colleagues understand that, faced with the need to fix this, we will have to reach an agreement that involves significant alignment with Brussels, although we will not technically be in a customs union.”Cabinet supporters of May’s preferred approach, including Philip Hammond and Greg Clark, believe it has a better chance of avoiding the risk of a hard border in Northern Ireland by allowing traders to move goods freely.“The technology is challenging for the hybrid option but if you solve it, it solves the Irish border question”, said a Whitehall source. “Max-fac is probably more technologically straightforward – but it requires borders.”However, the Brexiters are expected to push back against the idea that maintaining the integrity of the Good Friday agreement requires no infrastructure whatsoever between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Instead they will argue that unobtrusive checks set a few miles back from the border wouldn’t breach the government’s pledge to avoid a “hard border”.The departure of former home secretary Amber Rudd removes one of the strongest voices in support of staying in the customs union around the cabinet table. Brexiter sources have suggested that Javid, who reluctantly backed remain in the referendum, and Williamson, considered by colleagues to be pliable, would take a different position. The subcommittee could also be asked to consider extending membership of the customs union temporarily, while the successor arrangement is implemented. HMRC permanent secretary Jon Thompson told a select committee last September that the customs partnership could take up to five years to be introduced.On Brexit Williamson told an audience at the Institute of Economic Affairs on Tuesday night that it was “not the time to be timid or go into retreat”. He added: “As we look to Brexit, it is important that we see our Brexit choice not as a problem, but as an opportunity to expand our role in the world.”Mujtaba Rahman, managing director of political consultancy Eurasia Group, said with talks in Brussels at a standstill, negotiators would be watching the evolution of the government’s stance closely.“All eyes in Europe are on the Brexit subcommittee tomorrow, and what it throws up,” he said. But with the next round of talks in Brussels not due until late May, he suggested the prime minister could still delay narrowing her options too much.Rahman added that by continuing to press the hybrid option, which she knows is unacceptable to Brussels, May is engaged in “stagecraft”, while awaiting the outcome of a series of contentious parliamentary votes on the customs union. understands that neither the customs union, nor Brexit more generally, was brought up at Tuesday’s meeting of the full cabinet. They will be expected to endorse the final option once one is eventually agreed. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have been absolutely clear that we are leaving the customs union and won’t be joining a customs union. “We have put forward two proposals for addressing the customs issue in general and they will be discussed by the government further.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eea698da1965548192c84f122cbc9402e718945e/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eac000251a6cf305bf3e27e690aa23c","title":"sugar fat junk obsesity uk hugh jamie parliament health committee","story":"Exposed to ardour of TV chefs, the health committee dispenses with ceremony and sharp brains turn to juicy pulpThe proceedings are normally rather dour affairs but, for one afternoon only, the health and social care select committee was sprinkled with a little stardust as Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall came to give evidence on the UK’s obesity crisis. The two chefs strolled into the room, took off their jackets and sat down. Lights, camera, action. The Jamie and Hugh Show could now begin.“Hello Jamie, hello Hugh,” gasped the star-struck committee chair, Sarah Wollaston. It’s more usual for witnesses to be called by their surnames on these occasions, but no one was in the mood to stand on ceremony. The two chefs put on their best professional smiles: they’re used to the brains of ordinarily rational people being turned to pulp by celebrity.Jamie began with a bombshell. Words that haven’t been heard around Westminster for several years. He loved David Cameron and George Osborne. More than that, he adored them. He dabbed an eye, overcome with emotion. Several members of the committee shuffled uncomfortably in their seats but Jamie’s passions were not to be denied. Dave and George had been political colossi for embracing his vision and implementing a sugar tax.Here’s one they had prepared earlier. Jamie held up a bottle of pre-sugar tax Ribena he had brought with him and 12 white bits of paper taped together hung down. One for every teaspoon of sugar in the drink. He then passed a bottle of post-sugar tax Ribena to Hugh. This only had a trail of five pieces of white paper. “Change can be a beautiful thing,” he said. The soft drinks levy was a tax for love – a maternal kind of tax – not a tax on the poor.“What do you think, Hugh?” asked Wollaston, aware that Hugh had barely been allowed to get a word in edgeways.“He’s absolutely right,” replied Hugh. Jamie nodded approvingly. Echoes of “I agree with Nick”. On this particular show, Hugh was most definitely the sous-chef.Jamie moved into the first ad break. Food advertisements were the worst. Pure evil, designed to tempt children into tipping bucketfuls of sugar, fat and processed foods down their throats.But it didn’t have to be this way. Take Tony the Tiger, the Frosties icon, whom Theresa May had boasted of saving when she had pulled the plug on Dave and George’s obesity initiative in her psychopathic desire to kill as many children as possible. Jamie had news for Satan Theresa. Tony the Tiger was sick to his rotten back teeth of trying to turn kiddies into chubsters. He was deeply ashamed and desperate to make amends. Tony the Tiger had seen the light and wanted nothing more than to bound through the jungle promoting the benefits of chia seeds and celery.At this point, Hugh started to get in on the act. Forget Tony the Tiger. What he wanted was a real live Batman with carrots for ears. A superhero who could inspire people to go foraging for turnips. “I’ve got a programme on the TV about this tomorrow night,” he added helpfully. Not all ads are bad ads.After Jamie had followed this up with an all-out assault on “buy one get one free” offers, Labour’s Diana Johnson wondered what he would have to say to someone who was hard up and was tempted into buying four sausage rolls for £1.There was a hush in the room. Then Jamie spoke, a beatific look on his face. “A sausage roll is a thing of beauty,” he said. “It should be cherished.” There was nothing wrong with treats, but far too many sausage rolls were mere imposters. Rubbish meat just wrapped in fat. Out, out, damned Gloucester old spot.Hugh chipped in once more. “Perhaps,” he said, “instead of selling four sausage rolls, the butcher could sell two sausage rolls and a couple of carrots.” You never know, it might catch on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fd1c3033c7e5edfdedfcbed8b7481ccb2987c9b/0_53_4199_2519/master/4199.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ccabfdb22d5c7503df467405f2dcf74","title":"wealthy professionals most likely to drink alcohol regularly figures show","story":"British manual workers drink the least and middle-aged have most harmful habits, reports sayHigh earners in professional jobs, such as doctors, lawyers and teachers, are much more likely to be regular alcohol drinkers than those on average incomes, according to the latest official figures.Drinking rises steadily with socioeconomic status: people whose work is classified as routine and manual, including labourers, receptionists and care workers, were the least likely to have had alcohol in the week before they were asked.The reports come from NHS Digital (England only) and the Office for National Statistics. The ONS Opinions and Lifestyle Survey shows that in Great Britain in 2017, an estimated 29.2 million adults said they had drunk alcohol in the week before they were asked.How much people drink varies with age. A fifth of people said they did not drink at all. They were most likely to be between 25 and 64. Those most likely to drink were over 65.When the young drink, they are the most likely to binge on Friday and Saturday nights and then not drink for the rest of the week. Data from previous years in the Health Survey for England showed the most harmful drinking was among middle-aged people, who were more likely to drink every day.“Middle-class drinkers are unlikely to pay attention to government health warnings as they may be less likely to get excessively drunk, and can withstand increases in prices,” said Steve Clarke, an alcohol addiction therapy services manager with the Priory Group. The data was published on Tuesday, the day Scotland introduces minimum unit pricing after a long fight with the alcohol industry, which challenged its legality in the courts. The ONS findings support other evidence that price is a big factor in people’s drinking habits. Campaigners and experts hope minimum unit pricing will lead people, especially the most vulnerable, to forgo the strongest drinks because they will become more expensive. They are lobbying for England to follow Scotland’s example.“The Westminster government should now follow Scotland’s lead and introduce MUP in England,” said Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance, a coalition of more than 50 organisations.“Cheap alcohol is wrecking lives and livelihoods in England as well as Scotland. There are more than 23,000 deaths a year in England linked to alcohol, and many of these come from the poorest and most vulnerable sections of society.”He added: “Minimum unit pricing will save lives, cut crime and benefit the public finances. At the same time, pub prices will be left untouched, and moderate drinkers will barely notice the difference under MUP.“Any delay in implementing MUP in England will only cost lives and lead to unnecessary alcohol-related harm. We urge the Westminster government to act now.”Minimum unit pricing sets the lowest price at which a unit of alcohol can be sold, which in Scotland is now 50p. A pint of beer containing two units will now have to cost at least £1, and a bottle of wine containing nine units will have to cost at least £4.50. But the biggest impact will be on the very strong ciders and other strong alcoholic drinks that have been very cheap and are often bought by alcoholics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ceb21a267131486898a8cbe2ff1ae8fc75feef/0_241_5482_3290/master/5482.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68359675c5e4069c5fb4d3ba21e7b684","title":"athletics world cup usain bolt mo farah","story":"• New July event in London hopes to give fans new stars• Adam Gemili: ‘We need new heroes and new people to get behind’For the past decade Usain Bolt has almost single-handedly carried casual fans’ interest in athletics on his 6ft 4in frame, with Mo Farah providing much of the auxiliary work in Britain. But when the track and field season kicks off in Doha on Friday two of its most bankable names will no longer be doing the heavy lifting.Bolt has retired. Farah has quit the track and many in the sport are unsure what the future holds. The lack of a world championships or Olympics this year only makes them more fearful that the sport may drift further from the mainstream.As Adam Gemili, a member of Britain’s gold-medal winning 4x100m relay team at the 2017 world championships, conceded: “We need new heroes and new people to get behind, especially in Britain. Bolt is Bolt and will we ever see another athlete like him? Probably not. And Mo has left a massive gap too.”Yet Gemili, one of the more eloquent athletes, is nevertheless optimistic. “There’s a lot of talented athletes in Britain,” he said. “Katarina Johnson-Thompson can smash it when in form. Andrew Pozzi has been under the radar because of injuries but now people are seeing his worth. And Holly Bradshaw and Laura Muir are hugely talented too. One of the problems is the sport is not on TV regularly enough to be in the public eye. But when it is on, people get behind it.”This year UK Athletics is pinning its hopes on a new two-day competition, the Athletics World Cup, in which eight leading nations – including Britain, the US and Jamaica – will compete for a $2m (£1.47m) prize fund under floodlights at the Queen Elizabeth Stadium in London.Some think the event is a gamble, given it takes place on the same weekend as the World Cup final and the Wimbledon singles finals – and half the adult tickets will cost £100 or more (although the cheapest tickets are £38 and children’s tickets are £10).Richard Bowker, the new chair of UK Athletics, views it as an exciting opportunity. “Other sports have got World Cups that have been incredibly successful and this will be the same,” he said.“The format is a bit different, straight finals, one competitor from each country in each race, and with each point counting to a final tally.”Bowker is also confident the biggest names, including the world 60m champion Christian Coleman, will turn up and insists the World Cup will be the third pillar in a brilliant midsummer weekend of sport.“I rather like to think the guys at Fifa are sat there thinking: ‘Oh my goodness, we are the same day as the Athletics World Cup,’” he said, jokingly. “I think we will get World Cup fever, actually. I really do. The Fifa final and Wimbledon finals are in the afternoon, while we’re on at 7pm. They segue into each other. I think it will be an extraordinary weekend of sport.”Not everyone is as optimistic about the state of British athletics, given the lack of big sponsorship deals in recent years and the disappointing performance of some of the country’s athletes at last month’s Commonwealth Games.Bowker accepts the next generation will have to step up but is confident they can do so. “I spoke to Neil Black, our performance director, and he actually came back very positive from the Commonwealth Games,” he said.“There were some really good performances. Callum Hawkins is an absolutely phenomenal talent. Kyle Langford is great. Our sprinters are looking fantastic. And Johnson-Thompson got another gold medal.”He is just as optimistic about the sport’s future, despite Bolt’s retirement. “Athletics is cyclical. It moves on, it changes, it grows,” he said. “Usain was a one in a lifetime athlete and he did a huge amount for the sport. But this is a new era and there will be new stars.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d269dc920d86ee91a31b3c1eed5ee3ce8f3736/5_285_4780_2868/master/4780.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e55dd04cb689a5212721681d73b51a","title":"barry hawkins ding junhui world snooker championships","story":"• Hawkins, on verge of fourth semi-final in five years, leads 11-5• Kyren Wilson leads Mark Allen by same scorelineBarry Hawkins moved to within two frames of a place in the world championship semi-finals in Sheffield after a superb second session in his last-eight match against Ding Junhui.Hawkins, bidding to reach a fourth semi-final in five years, won six of the eight frames on Tuesday evening to end the day 11-5 up. Kyren Wilson led Mark Allen by the same scoreline after powering ahead in the evening.

As the Leicester and England prop reflects on his first season with the club he joined 12 years ago that has not ended with a place in the play-offs, he offers a succinct summation: not good\u0026nbspenough.Successive home defeats by Northampton, who had previously won only one match on the road this season, and Newcastle, who on Saturday entertain Wasps in a third-place tussle, have left the Tigers outside the top four and needing to secure two points at Sale on Saturday to be certain of maintaining their record of being the only English club to qualify for every European Cup.“It is a tough pill to swallow but the table does not lie and the top four deserve to be there,” said Cole, who has been on the past two Lions tours. “It is the first time we have missed out on the play-offs for 14 years. We have to reflect on this and come back stronger next season.“We have not been good enough. We have lost five league matches at home and we have not scored enough points. The league is competitive with everyone capable of beating everyone else. You have to be at your best every week and we have not been. We have scraped into the play-offs in the past when we did not really deserve to and the only positive from this is that we will have a longer off-season to put right what went wrong.”The defeat by Newcastle at Welford Road on Friday reflected Leicester’s season. They blew a 10-point lead in the final 11 minutes and had Gloucester beaten Bath at home the following day, the Tigers’ hold on a place in the top six and Champions Cup qualification would be more precarious.Gloucester will be in the Champions Cup next season after reaching the Challenge Cup final and go into their final match at Saracens not having to worry about where they finish in the Premiership. Leicester will start the weekend in fifth, two points ahead of Gloucester and four ahead of Sale, who are chasing a place in the top six.“You want to be in Europe’s top competition and we have to defeat Sale to confirm that,” Cole said. “They score a lot of tries, have a dangerous back three and Faf de Klerk runs the show behind a strong pack. We know we are going to have to play.“We reviewed the Newcastle game this week but the inquest on the season will wait until next week. What I would say is we have made progress as a squad and as a club off the field and we are a lot better than we were this time a year ago. Mark Bakewell came in as forwards coach halfway through the season and he has been brilliant: he will have a whole pre-season to bed things in and we will regroup.”Cole also endured a difficult season with England, who finished fifth in the Six Nations, their lowest in the championship, after losing their three matches.“The Six Nations is as competitive as it has been for a while and that makes it the best international tournament going,”Cole said. “We had a difficult tournament but we have not become a bad side. We lost in Scotland and France but there were periods in both when the game was there for us.”England have a three-Test tour to South Africa, who are expected to include at least five overseas-based players in their squad, next month. Eddie Jones has talked about resting some of his Lions but Cole does not know the coach’s thinking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd3a25af0ed453892101e75c45958db4c3acffe5/0_91_2975_1786/master/2975.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c32b7dcf6bac1fb43ba9a62abb768c1f","title":"cavaliers raptors game 1 lebron overtime","story":"LeBron James had 26 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds, JR Smith scored 20 points and the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Toronto Raptors 113-112 in overtime on Tuesday night to win Game 1 of their second-round playoff series.Kyle Korver scored 19 points, including the go-ahead 3-pointer in overtime after Cleveland never led in regulation. Tristan Thompson had 14 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who have eliminated Toronto in each of the past two postseasons.Toronto’s Fred VanVleet missed a three-pointer with 3.4 seconds to go in overtime that could have won it for the Raptors, who couldn’t hold on to a 14-point, first-quarter lead.James’ game-tying fadeaway jumper over Toronto rookie OG Anunoby with 30 seconds left in regulation proved a dagger in the hearts of the Raptors, who came up frigid throughout the fourth quarter.Jonas Valanciunas had 21 points and 21 rebounds, Kyle Lowry had 18 points and 10 assists, and DeMar DeRozan scored 22 points for the Raptors, who host Game 2 on Thursday night.Jeff Green scored 16 points and Kevin Love had 13 rebounds.The Cavaliers beat the Raptors in six games in the Eastern Conference finals in 2016 before going on to win their first NBA championship. Last year, Cleveland swept Toronto in the second round.Korver’s three early in overtime gave the Cavaliers their first lead of the game, 108-105.Lowry’s three-point play made it 113-112 with 57 seconds to go and, after the Cavs were called for a shot-clock violation, Toronto had one more chance to win, but VanVleet couldn’t come through.VanVleet was one of four Raptors to miss in the final seconds of regulation. Toronto got four looks at the potential winning basket on its next possession but missed all four, including a wide-open three by VanVleet, giving Cleveland the ball with 0.6 seconds remaining. Green inbounded to James, but his shot bounced off the rim.The Raptors shot 5 for 24 in the fourth quarter, with Valanciunas missing six of seven attempts.DeRozan scored 11 points in the first, connecting on five of eight attempts, and Lowry had eight points and five assists as Toronto led 33-19.

With James on the bench, the Cavs scored two points the rest of the quarter.Green and Smith each scored 11 points in the second quarter and the Cavs found their shooting stroke, connecting on 14 of 22 attempts. James had five assists in the period as Cleveland cut the deficit to 60-57 at halftime.VanVleet took exception to a shove from James at the end of one play and made an attempt to get at the Cavs star, but was restrained by teammates.Valanciunas had 13 points and eight rebounds in the third, but Korver scored 10 points and James had eight to keep the Cavs close. Toronto led 87-82 heading to the fourth.Long before tipoff, Stephen Curry swished his routine tunnel shot on the second try. Once the game began, the two-time MVP stood along the bench anxiously waiting for his turn, shaking his legs and clapping his hands with nervous energy and anticipation.Then – mouthpiece dangling, of course – Curry finally entered at the 4:20 mark of the first quarter to a roaring ovation from the Oracle Arena crowd and immediately got to work. He knocked down a three-pointer from the left wing 11 seconds later and was off and running in Golden State’s 121-116 victory over the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday night.“The ball swung to him and he just launched. It didn’t surprise me. That’s who he is,” coach Steve Kerr said. “That was a fun moment.”Curry came off the bench to score 28 points in a triumphant return from a knee injury and nearly six weeks off, and the Warriors held off Anthony Davis and the pesky Pelicans to go ahead 2-0 in the Western Conference semifinals.All is right with the Warriors again now that No30 is back on the floor – even as a backup.Kevin Durant scored 29 points with a huge 3-pointer with 3:10 to play, to go with seven assists and six rebounds in Golden State’s franchise-record 14th consecutive postseason victory at Oracle Arena. Draymond Green contributed 20 points, 12 assists and nine rebounds while battling Davis on both ends all night.Davis finished with 25 points and 15 rebounds, and Jrue Holiday had 24 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Pelicans, who also got 22 points and 12 assists from Rajon Rondo.Andre Iguodala converted a snazzy three-point play with 6:41 left when he flipped the ball up and it came back down and through the net as he was fouled by Rondo, then Golden State pulled away.The best-of-seven series resumes with Game 3 on Friday at New Orleans.Curry shot 8 for 15 with five 3-pointers and grabbed seven rebounds in 27 minutes. He let it fly for a 30-foot three in the closing minute of the third.“He’s going to score,” New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said.The Warriors were focused on keeping their edge after a blowout Game 1 win.Just the energy Curry brings helped that cause.The whole place came alive when he made his first appearance on the floor.“That was a special moment when Steph checked into the game,” Kerr said.Curry had been sidelined since spraining his left knee on 23 March, the same day he came back from a six-game absence with a right ankle injury.He already had a history of brilliant returns from injuries.In late December against Memphis, Curry came back after being sidelined 11 games with a sprained right ankle to score 38 points with 10 three-pointers.Curry returned for Game 4 of the Warriors’ five-game Western Conference semifinals against Portland two years ago and made 16 of 32 shots with five 3-pointers and scored 17 points in overtime on the way to 40 in a 132-125 victory. He grabbed nine rebounds and dished out eight assists.The game had its testy moments.Curry made a bounce pass in transition to Iguodala late in the third and Solomon Hill was hit with a flagrant 1 for grabbing Iguodala’s neck area as he shot. That came 14 seconds after a double-technical against Davis and Green after they got tangled and rolled around and over each other.“I live for playoff basketball. It’s the most fun time of the year for me,” Green said.Klay Thompson never found his groove and went 4 for 20, 2 of 11 on 3s, and scored 10 points. Iguodala scored 15.Green drove coast to coast for a three-point play 2:08 before halftime, then Thompson banked in a 3 at the halftime buzzer for a 58-55 Warriors edge at intermission.Even a balanced Pelicans attack – they took 105 shots – with all five starters scoring in double figures wasn’t enough to stop the explosive defending champions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cee8e690138497fb804ef7ab9407fc948ceb266/0_148_3653_2192/master/3653.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fd9af6a32e881419f47d3b296c01a5e","title":"one green bottle review soho theatre london kathryn hunter hideki noda","story":"Soho theatre, LondonKathryn Hunter is the patriarch in Hideki Noda’s strange, yet ultimately moving, family tale that draws on Japanese traditionHideki Noda is a master of the theatrical endgame. In his 2012 show The Bee, a man’s family are taken hostage by an escaped convict so the man duly kidnaps the convict’s family. In this apocalyptic farce – the third of three Noda plays to be staged by Soho theatre, all starring the ever-playful Kathryn Hunter and all cast against gender – the family home becomes a prison of their own making. Hunter plays family patriarch Boo, the self-styled “legend of the classical stage” clinging to more than 600 years of Noh history. He is going out for the evening but wife Bo (Noda, who also directs) and daughter Pickle (Glyn Pritchard) also have appointments and are just as determined to leave the house. But with Princess the dog about to give birth, somebody has to stay home for the evening. Who is it going to be? Drawing on the Noh theatre tradition and featuring live musical accompaniment from Japanese kabuki musician Denzaemon Tanaka XIII, this is as strange and dislocating an evening as you can currently find in London. It’s like watching a heightened Ray Cooney farce crossed with Beckett and overlaid with a heavy veneer of Japanese cultural references. It is distinctly odd, and yet in the end oddly moving, too, as the entire family’s failure to take responsibility for the future has appalling consequences. The performances are spot-on, and if the outlandishness of the comedy sometimes veers dangerously close to being irritating, the piece earns its ending as it demonstrates the madness of standing your ground and refusing to give an inch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f29bb15b0927ffb0f74411763c9cff05fc921c0/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb526b8a6d6789af8adc72b663a51a8a","title":"apple second quarterly report best ever iphone x","story":"With revenues of over $61bn, Apple beat its 2015 record in the report released Tuesday – but sales of its most valuable product are slowingApple on Tuesday shook off worries that its $1,000 iPhone had failed to live up to the hype – but sales of the world’s most valuable company’s most valuable product are slowing, and Apple has announced a plan to buy its way out of trouble. “We’re thrilled to report our best March quarter ever, with strong revenue growth in iPhone, services and wearables,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer. “We are very bullish on Apple’s future,” Cook told analysts after the news broke.Apple sold 9.11m iPads and 4.08m Macs over the quarter.Analysts had worried that the high-priced iPhone X would dent sales. The results came after Apple suppliers including AMS and Taiwan Semiconductors have reported slowing revenues in a sign seen by analysts as proof of shaky demand for iPhone X.The iPhone remains Apple’s biggest product, even as sales of services and other items, including the Apple Watch, have grown. Services – from the Apple Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and others – generated $9bn over the quarter. But the 11-year-old mobile device accounts for the majority Apple’s revenues and contributed $100bn over the quarter. Despite the better-than-expected results, however, sales are slowing.Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the results did not mean innovation in the high-end smartphone is dead.Husson said: “However, it indicates Apple will have to smartly manage its iPhone product portfolio and pricing, especially in Asia, where some countries still witness smartphone growth Apple has proven over the past few years that it masters the art and science of managing its product portfolio.”Yet Husson believes 2018 represents a tipping point for Apple. “It has no choice but to demonstrate it can reduce its dependency on iPhone sales and enter new adjacent markets and territories,” he said. “Because it’s a human-centered and ideas-driven marketing company, Apple is still the most valuable brand worldwide and it would be a mistake to make too early a call based on this quarterly financial earnings.”On a call with analysts Cook was once again critical of tech rivals, including Facebook, that have been rocked by privacy scandals. “We believe privacy is a fundamental human right,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/377460c9c9dc493cee3699e358e0020069a51c46/0_406_4041_2426/master/4041.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bed75c39e6c19580f648133a53a31fa","title":"how i deciphered silent witness using football and a spreadsheet","story":"When the ’s football tactics wizard wanted a way to unwind between assignments, the BBC’s pathology drama seemed like the perfect foil. Then he noticed some giant plot holes and former Southampton striker Neil ShipperleyLast year, I watched my first episode of Silent Witness – largely because I’d run out of Poirots, Marples, Veras, Rebuses, Morses and Endeavours. It had always been there, vaguely in the background for the previous 21 years, but it was never something that had much concerned me. But it was good, just preposterous enough – ideal for a football journalist looking for something to watch over lunch while working from home or to wind down in another featureless hotel room after a game.I watched season 20 first, then 19, and then went back to the start when, rather than the ensemble based around Dr Nikki Alexander (Emilia Fox), the main character was Dr Sam Ryan (Amanda Burton). I preferred the broader scope of the more recent episodes (each story was initially screened on BBC in two parts, each lasting an hour I have used the term “episode” to refer to a two-hour long story as it was subsequently broadcast on channels such as UKTV’s Drama Channel). My preference for the later episodes meant I jumped to season eight, when Burton leaves and Fox comes in. But then I felt bad about neglecting the early ones so began alternating between seasons two and nine, then three and 10, and so on, while also watching season 21 when it was screened earlier this year.Keeping track of which episodes I’d seen became difficult, so I drew up a chart to help. This has been brutally satirised on the ’s Football Weekly podcast, which has suggested I have some sort of exhaustive spreadsheet, all arrows and photos like the evidence boards used (at least by TV police) in murder investigations. I don’t, but immersion in a series means you do start to notice patterns: recurring plots, recurring actors and – far more significant – a recurring piece of football commentary.Now, if I’m aware of that, with just a notepad and a memory that essentially is no longer good for anything other than reeling off sports statistics from the 1980s, you can only assume that the writers and producers know exactly what they are doing. So when Neil Stuke (AKA The Stuke) appears playing Ch Insp Cooke in series 21, you realise that the most logical explanation is that Andy Fox, the rogue undercover cop he played in series three, must actually have survived despite appearing to commit suicide while in police custody. Perhaps that’s not a surprise – it probably suited everybody for him to be believed dead so he could start afresh – but it means Dr Ryan must have faked the postmortem. Shockingly, she had form.At the end of series one, DC Kerry Cox, played by Ruth Gemmell, is ‘killed’ after a blow to the head from a metal beam. Again, Dr Ryan stages the postmortem, and yet Cox reappears in series 10 under the name Beth Ashdown, having lost her north-east accent and been promoted to DI. (It may be that in the Silent Witness universe surnames ending “-ox” are a code for undercover officers). By series 17, the Gemmell figure has left the force, married a policeman and taken the name Ellie Brooke. The pressure of her multiple identities seems to have got to her and, after two suicide attempts, she kills a pregnant woman. None of that, though, is as confusing as the mystery of Neil Shipperley’s disallowed goal for Southampton against Manchester United, which hangs over the second season. The incident is first seen on television as a neighbour goes to visit a grieving neighbour one evening. It’s easily identified as having happened during United’s 2-0 FA Cup quarter-final on Monday 11 March 1996. So far, so plausible. Except there is something odd. The game was on Sky, whose commentators were Martin Tyler and Andy Gray, but the voice we hear over the footage of Shipperley is that of David Pleat. The former Tottenham manager’s words weren’t broadcast until the highlights on Match of the Day, screened on BBC One at 10.10pm that evening. Yet it’s implied – and the light suggests – the game is being watched live. Perhaps the streetlighting is very bright, or perhaps this is a hint that this moment illuminates the entire show.In the very next episode, as a suspect sits in front of a television, we hear Pleat’s incredulity at the referee’s decision once again. In itself, that’s not problematic. Why wouldn’t two people in Cambridge both be watching the same match? And why wouldn’t the writers separate out two unrelated cases to make the plotting simpler? Except that Dr Ryan’s relationship with Supt Ross, going well at the time of Pleat one, has all but collapsed by the time of Pleat two.Perhaps the suspect has simply recorded Match of the Day and is watching a video some time later. But another, more intriguing, possibility occurs. What if these two cases were concurrent? What if Dr Ryan, a pathologist we know to have faked at least two postmortems, provoking who knows what feelings of guilt and anxiety, is prone to mood swings? That might explain why, across 27 episodes over eight seasons, she is so incapable of maintaining a stable relationship with anybody, from her mother and sister to lovers or colleagues.The whole programme, perhaps, is rather more subtle than is generally realised. After all, can it really be coincidence that the FA Cup tie that turns out to be the key to the whole series was played just three days before Silent Witness aired for the very first time?

Chandler, who founded the Legatum thinktank, rejected the claim as “complete nonsense”.Seely said that he and four other MPs had seen documents from Monaco’s security department. These “brief, terse, factual files” related to “national security and money laundering” and included information supplied by the DST intelligence agency, France’s equivalent of MI5.The MP said senior French intelligence sources plus their British and American counterparts had “authenticated” their content. He added: “The documents indicated a link – a noted inidual in this country – with Russian intelligence.”The files dated from 2005 and covered a period from the mid-1990s, he said. They concerned “Christopher Chandler and his brother”, the MP said, adding that he was convinced the files were genuine. He told the Commons: “According to the French intelligence services, as recorded by their colleagues in Monaco ... Mr Chandler is described as having been ‘an object of interest’ to the DST since 2002 on suspicion of working for Russian intelligence services.”Monaco intelligence ision had marked Chandler’s file with an S, to indicate “counter-espionage”, he added.The Legatum Institute has advocated hard Brexit and has had significant influence on ministerial thinking, especially over trade policy. Chandler and his brother Richard were born in New Zealand and made their fortunes from a series of investments in Russia in the 1990s.Legatum robustly denied the MP’s allegations on Tuesday. In a statement, the institute said that Chandler “has never been associated directly or indirectly with Russian intelligence or the Russian state”.It added: “Neither Christopher Chandler nor anyone at Legatum is aware of any such alleged “investigation” by the French authorities, not 16 years ago or at any time since. “To be clear Christopher Chandler has never been approached at any time by the French or any other authorities regarding Russia and maintains a sterling record of ethical business practices earned over many decades.” It called the accusations “complete nonsense” and said Legatum had “previously rebutted them”. Speaking in the Commons, the MP Ben Bradshaw who has previously raised questions about the Kremlin’s possible role in Brexit said he called for an investigation into Legatum last November.Bradshaw said he was concerned by Seely’s new “information” and by the “growing corruption, money laundering and sale of passports by Malta, where Chandler has just acquired citizenship”. The MP called on the UK authorities to “urgently investigate”.Last year the Mail on Sunday published a detailed story on Chandler’s alleged ties to Moscow. It claimed that Legatum’s economics director, Shanker Singham, had met Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, and had coordinated a letter written by them to Theresa May demanding a hard Brexit. Singham held discussions with leading cabinet Brexiters on multiple occasions, and saw representatives of David Davis’s department six times in the year up to August 2017, it has been reported. Singham recently left to work for a rightwing thinktank. Legatum said at the time in a statement that Singham had been sought out for his “unparalleled knowledge and expertise”. Legatum has said it will do less Brexit work and instead concentrate on the benefits of international trade. Chandler and Legatum’s chief executive, Mark Stoleson, became Maltese citizens in 2015. They say their applications were unrelated to Brexit, and were made the previous year.The Legatum institute responded to the Mail on Sunday with  a lengthy statement. Among other things, it said that Chandler was “a much-loved friend of the institute” but that he had no role within it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3cef50af3c2ba5c4dd8cc1c15cc3409cfb02eb4/0_204_5976_3584/master/5976.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4f1c27f1dbdd35ea921701ae48a0320","title":"chile disappeared excavations colonia dignidad","story":"Colonia Dignidad was a secretive enclave run by an ex-Nazi paedophile where victims of the Pinochet regime were tortured, killed and buriedThe road to Villa Baviera winds 380km south from Chile’s capital, Santiago, through forests and fields of newly harvested hay, to the foothills of the Andes.At the resort’s hotel, tourists sip German beer and enjoy the scenery, but the tranquil setting belies a horrific past: until 1991, the sprawling compound was known as Colonia Dignidad, and was home to a religious sect led by a convicted paedophile and former Nazi.During the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, the enclave was also used as a clandestine torture site where about 300 people were interrogated and tortured by the Dina (National Intelligence Directorate) secret police. Between 1973 and 1978, at least 100 people are believed to have been murdered at the site and their bodies destroyed.Now a new hunt is under way to find a grave believed to contain the remains of some of those who were “disappeared” at Colonia Dignidad. Relatives still fighting for answers hope that fresh excavations may reveal forensic science evidence – and grant them a degree of closure.“Finding this grave is the last hope for the families of the disappeared. The search must continue for as long as it takes to find it,” said Winfried Hempel, a lawyer representing the victims of human rights abuses perpetrated at the enclave.Colonia Dignidad was founded in 1961 by Paul Schäfer, a former medic in the Nazi-era German army who fled Germany in 1959 after being charged with child abuse.Surrounded by watchtowers and electrified fences and patrolled by armed men and guard dogs, the community was populated by about 300 Germans, and cut off from the rest of Chile.Schäfer – who died in a prison hospital in 2010 – was accused of running a cult-like community where he systematically abused young children. According to prosecutors, he also allowed Pinochet’s agents to torture political prisoners in a maze of stone-walled tunnels beneath the enclave.In 1978, the Dina chief, Manuel Contreras – hoping to destroy evidence of human rights abuses – ordered the exhumation and disposal of all the executed prisoners’ remains.According to Chile’s national commission for truth and reconciliation, 40 corpses may have been dug up at Colonia Dignidad, before being chemically burned and their ashes tossed into the river Perquilauquén, which runs to the south of the 37,000-acre compound.But recently, a former member of the colony – who at the time was in charge of the heavy machinery used to exhume the bodies – testified that one grave had been left intact.The victims of Colonia Dignidad were not all Chileans: in 1985, Boris Weisfeiler, a nationalised US citizen born in the Soviet Union, vanished while trekking a few miles from the enclave. According to witnesses, local police detained and beat him before taking him to the colony where he disappeared.“After 33 years of agonising search to find my brother, I still hold hope that they find his remains,” said Boris’s sister, Olga Weisfeiler, who lives in Boston, Massachusetts.Eight retired police and military officers were eventually indicted over Weisfeiler’s abduction in 2012, but four years later, a judge applied the statute of limitations and closed the case.“I have given up on getting answers from the Chilean government as to what happened to him,” she said. “At present, it seems both the Chilean government and its judicial system are complicit in stalling the judicial process and in avoiding taking responsibility for my brother’s tragic death.”In October, the search for the truth of Villa Baviera gained new impetus when Judge Mario Carroza ordered a new search of the site, but the recent election of billionaire businessman Sebastián Piñera as president has raised fears that there is little political appetite for a full reckoning.After more than a decade on the run, Schäfer was arrested in 2005 and sentenced to 20 years in jail for sexually abusing and torturing children at the colony.Today, Villa Baviera is run by Anna Schnellenkamp, daughter of one of Paul Schäfer’s right-hand men, Kurt Schnellenkamp, who died in 2017 after serving a five-year prison sentence for enabling Schäfer’s abuse.The colony survives on income from a poultry farm, which produces 30,000 eggs a day, and tourism: there is a manmade-lake with pedal boats, a restaurant serving venison, sauerkraut and other German dishes, and a small museum that makes no mention of the disappeared.Relatives of the disappeared say that the site of mass murder should not be a leisure centre they have called for Villa Baviera to be closed and replaced with a memorial. “It is not possible that a place where serious violations of human rights such as torture, murders and disappearances should function as a tourist destination,” said Margarita Romero, president of the Association of Memory and Human Rights.“Imagine a hotel built in a concentration camp in Europe – it would never be permitted.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef5651f6461dae923ce0985b7e8df2876cda35d/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb84c1ac283ba718b1cb5c000c0eaad2","title":"jacinda ardern asks why new zealand is left off world maps in new tourism campaign","story":"Video shows the prime minister and NZ comedian Rhys Darby questioning why the nation has been omitted from so many maps New Zealand is aiming to crack the mystery of why it is often left off world maps, as part of a new tourism campaign featuring prime minister Jacinda Ardern.The #getnzonthemap campaign features Ardern and Flight of the Conchords comedian Rhys Darby in a two-minute video exploring why the nation is continually left off maps of the globe.“We’re a bit of a fiddly looking shaped country, a bit like a half-eaten lamb chop. Perhaps people are just leaving us off, thinking we’re a mistake?” Darby tells Ardern in the video. Despite the global popularity of the country’s prime minister and the country’s long association with hobbits and Middle Earth, the video shows the nation repeatedly been left off maps, including at The Smithsonian Natural History Museum, Central Park Zoo, Starbucks and Ikea. In the video, Darby jokingly refers to Ardern as “your majesty”, “your highness”, “Cindy”, and “my lady” and explores the notion that there’s a “big conspiracy going on” to obscure the island nation. New Zealand is located in the South west Pacific ocean, 2,000km from Sydney, 2,000km from Antarctica and home to 4.7 million people.A reddit thread dedicated to recording incidents where New Zealand is left off global maps has nearly 30,000 subscribers, and last year the BBC vox-popped Londoners asking if they could identify which country was missing.

The charismatic 26-year-old, rarely seen without his “Pashteen hat”, leads the Pashtun Protection Movement (PTM), which has convulsed the country with unprecedentedly virulent criticism of the powerful armed forces. It accuses the military of being behind a litany of abuses in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata), an inhospitable, mountainous region on the border with Afghanistan dominated by Pakistan’s 15-million-strong Pashtun minority and which has played host to a variety of terrorist groups.Although Pashteen is committed to non-violent protest, his youthfulness, firebrand speeches and distinctive headgear have drawn comparisons with Che Guevara.What marks the PTM out as a particular threat to Pakistan’s army, which has ruled the country for more than half its 70-year history, is that its allegations mirror those made by western officials, namely that the army plays a “double game” with regard to terrorism, silently supporting groups that target India and Afghanistan.The government has responded with a crackdown, banning rallies and harassing PTM supporters. Nine PTM activists have gone missing in Karachi, Pakistan’s southern business capital. At a rally last weekend in Swat, pro-military protesters tried to block entry to some of a 25,000-strong crowd.Even the “Pashteen hat” has been subjected to local, unofficial bans. Replicas can no longer be found in the Swat valley city of Mingora, where at least five shopkeepers selling the hat were recently detained and beaten by thugs associated with the military, locals say.At a rally in Lahore on 21 April, held in defiance of the government ban, Pashteen bowed his head like a boxer as minders escorted him through an exultant, selfie-taking crowd to a stage adorned with pictures of missing people. Earlier that day, sewage had mysteriously flooded the ground. About 8,000 people – many in the Pashteen cap – chanted “the uniforms are behind the terrorists”, a slogan that fosters particular apoplexy in the military’s headquarters in Rawalpindi.Pashteen tells his audience that he has come to Lahore, a city populated by relatively few Pashtuns, to “expose what the army are doing against us”. To his right, a gigantic poster shows a devastated, rubble-strewn street in a town in North Waziristan partly flattened during a 2014 military campaign against Pakistan’s Taliban. That campaign is credited with helping reduce deaths from terrorism by more than two-thirds. Yet, according to the PTM, ordinary Pashtuns were caught in the crossfire, and have ever since been subject to humiliating curfews, checkpoints and collective punishment by troops stationed to maintain order.So-called enforced disappearances generate particular grief. A government commission has dealt with almost 5,000 cases since 2011, but rights groups say this number vastly underestimates the scale of the problem. “According to the constitution, anybody who commits a crime must be produced in a court of law within 24 hours,” says Pashteen. “But so many people have been taken and are still missing.” His voice rising, almost to a scream, Pashteen yells at the crowd “are you with the tyrants?” He calls on ordinary soldiers to defy the orders of high command, a statement some have interpreted as treasonous. One rally-goer from Pakistan’s Punjab majority bites his lip and glances anxiously over his shoulder. “It’s quite remarkable hearing this,” he says, on condition of anonymity. “What it portends for Pakistan I don’t know.”By tradition the military is largely referred to in code, as “the establishment” or, in the case of agents of the feared Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), “angels”. Among PTM-supporters, however, that is changing. “Before the PTM we didn’t say anything, even in our bedrooms, about the ISI and military intelligence,” says Shehrullah Khan, whose brother was “disappeared” from his luggage shop in 2016. With some safety in numbers, “we can now say everything in our mind and hearts”. PTM leaders admit that some of the disappeared may have links to the Taliban, but argue that all should be produced in court to face charges.A white flag, representing the movement’s commitment to non-violent protest, flutters above the stage. Among the stereotypes Pashteen is helping to break down, says analyst Fasi Zaka, is that of “Pashtuns being a martial ethnic group given to conflict”. Its leaders argue that Pashtuns are more victims of the Taliban than the willing hosts often portrayed in the media. One, Ali Wazir, has had 17 members of his family or killed.The military response betrays choking discomfort. General Bajwa, the chief of army staff, has referred indirectly to the PTM as being “engineered” by Pakistan’s enemies. Reporting on the movement has been censored in the media. Yet, unable to stop its growth, corps commander Lt General Nazir Ahmad Butt held a meeting last week with the PTM to discuss its “legitimate grievances”, referring to a five-point list of demands that includes de-mining, the punishment of a Karachi police chief accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, and a “truth and reconciliation commission” on enforced disappearances.“The PTM’s success,” says civil rights activist Jibran Nasir, is that after years of denial, some in the military “admit there have been some transgressions”.From the back seat of a car whisking him away from a horde of supporters, Pashteen tells the  that he is unconcerned by a possible threat to his life. “At first my family said they would throw me out of the house,” he says, “but now they say if you are killed, then at least you will have done something for the people.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6a0b0dfb77ba4f782654801f1f991833431ffaa/144_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69095d3fe230f0d580f0af93ad420ead","title":"radio dodo syrian refugee children bedtime","story":"Canadian Brigitte Alepin’s brainchild is a bilingual radio station with stories, songs and segments to help Syria’s scattered kids get to sleep“Attention ladies and gentlemen, come closer! The circus – and your favourite radio show – is about to start,” says a French-Canadian veteran journalist in French. He turns to his co-host, a Syrian storyteller, who repeats the words into her microphone, this time in Arabic.In the tiny downtown studio of a student radio station in Montreal, Bernard Derome and Marya Zarif are recording a radio show for Syrian refugee children.Launched in 2017 with the support of the Canadian Commission for Unesco, Radio-Dodo, or Sleepytime-Radio, has already broadcast 37 episodes online and through Radio-Rozana, a Syrian radio station based in Paris. News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can follow up with our Further Reading guides and can also recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThe weekly bilingual show mixes stories, songs and segments about everything from tying your shoelaces to why your milk teeth fall out. The aim is to help Syrian refugee children around the world forget about their worries and fall asleep at night. The woman behind the show is Brigitte Alepin, a French-Canadian tax expert whose Syrian grandfather immigrated to Canada in the early 20th century.When the Syrian war erupted in 2011, Alepin said she felt shocked and helpless only a few years earlier, she had visited her grandfather’s hometown of Aleppo with her young son. Throughout the trip he had played with local children now, she couldn’t help wondering about them.“I asked myself, how is it that life makes it possible for my boy – who had been in Aleppo – now to be safe at home in Quebec?” she said. “I told myself I would never be able to feel good about myself again if I didn’t find a way to help.”For a while, Alepin wondered how she could help Syrian refugees half a world away, but as she discussed the problem with a friend, an idea formed: radio waves could cross borders and reach an audience anywhere around the world. “We were talking and a little while later, I had an intuition: I would try to make a radio show for children,” said Alepin. She gathered a small team of Syrian, Algerian and Canadian volunteers to help her organize the show, find content and sign up storytellers. Prominent Canadian writers including Kim Thuy and Wadji Mouawad, and former Canadian Olympic athlete Marie-Ève Marleau have appeared on the show to read stories or discuss their jobs.Most of the audience is in Turkey and Quebec. One regular listener is Rahaf, a 10-year-old Syrian refugee from Damascus who came to Montreal in 2016 with her two brothers and their parents.Rahaf uses her brother’s laptop to listen to the show as she falls asleep her favourite story so far was about a dog taking the bus by himself.“I just listen on my bed and I sing along,” she said in French, her new language.Rahaf’s mother, Basma – who asked for the family’s surname to be withheld – said that her husband and sons escaped to Jordan first. But when Basma and Rahaf attempted to follow, they were arrested and jailed for 18 months. After being released, she and her siblings lived in a refugee camp in Jordan for three years conditions were harsh, and there was no chance for the children to go to school.Now Rahaf is getting used to her new life, going to school during the day and playing at home. “I like telling myself stories and when I have a new book, I read it to myself,” she said.Alepin says she wants to continue spreading love and joy to refugee children and plans to further expand her project. She has recently found a partner radio station in Mali to broadcast her show to children in the French-speaking country, and hopes that eventually Radio-Dodo can become a global radio show for child refugees around the world.

The company referred to Mr O’Brien’s role leading the Irish national health service in a March 21st public statement to the stock market released in advance of its annual meeting next week.As a non-executive director of the company Mr O’Brien will receive an “annual cash retainer” of $50,000 in addition to $10,000 a year from his role as chairman of the company’s compensation committee and $5,000 a year as a member of the company’s audit committee.The HSE chief currently holds no shares in the company.The company’s filing last month says, however, that he has the chance to buy into the company he will be awarded options for 24,691 shares, which would be worth $181,725 based on Evofem’s share price last night on Wall Street’s Nasdaq technology-dominated stock exchange.

They might get emotional and start kicking up. They might even decide to sue.Women of Ireland: What you don’t know won’t hurt us . . .Another day in the Dáil and another gallop of TDs into the chamber to agonise over the latest sorry episode concerning this State’s disordered relationship with women from the waist down. More than once, TDs listed the many dangerous indignities visited on Irish women through the decades by a paternalistic establishment.The Taoiseach led the way in the afternoon as the cervical cancer screening scandal became the main topic of discussion, running well into the evening with the Minister for Health listening to statements and taking questions for more than three hours.“I know this whole controversy is having a huge impact on the women of Ireland. It is about women’s health it’s about women’s lives,” said Leo Varadkar, as women wondered if there will ever come a day when the intimate details of their health and their lives are not dissected and debated and held up for public scrutiny by very important men.“This comes after a very difficult year with controversies around issues such as #MeToo, sexual harassments and difficult rape trials and other matters as well. And I know this country hasn’t always treated women very well, and in the past and even today perhaps, treats them very badly, whether it is mother and baby homes or Magdalen laundries or the marriage bar or the Hep C scandal.”As the contributions from TDs piled up, Leo’s initial list was expanded by other speakers.Of course, the catalogue of insults they reopened was an old one. These things don’t happen in these more enlightened times.Except they do.“Even tonight you’ve been put in the unenviable position of coming in here with new information, drip-feed, reclarifying the information,” said Daly. She accepted the cancer screening process is not wholly reliable. Mistakes happen no matter what systems are in place and tragedies happen and will continue to happen. How society responds is what matters.It was agreed by all sides the response by CervicalCheck and ultimately the HSE to the women whose cancer was not detected in their initial tests has been completely unacceptable.The situation is a mess. Women who have had cervical smears and were given the all-clear are now worrying their results may not have been correct. The Taoiseach made a point of stressing “there is nobody walking around today with a cervical cancer diagnosis from whom that information is being withheld by the HSE.”He was personally “very angry” that women were not told that following an audit of their tests it was discovered that pre-cancerous cells were not picked up when they had their first check. “I’m a Taoiseach, a doctor and also a brother with two sisters.”He mentioned his anger twice. “Not just angry, Taoiseach, you should be livid, livid about what’s after happening in these cases,” responded Joan Collins of Independents4Change.Meanwhile, Alan Kelly couldn’t believe his ears when Minister for Health Simon Harris imparted his new information. It was “a bombshell that you’re after landing in her tonight, which I wasn’t prepared for . . . This is a bombshell. What volume of women haven’t had their cases audited?”And he looked around the chamber, with its usual overpopulation of men in suits.“We actually have a big problem in this country protecting women’s health” he declared, adding that Vicky Phelan, the woman with terminal cancer whose diagnosis was missed and who had to take her fight to the High Court, was probably following the debate at home.“I’m sure she’s watching us all here tonight, fellas,” he said.Louise O’Reilly, Sinn Fein’s health spokeswoman, echoed remarks made during Leaders’ Questions by Mary Lou McDonald about the decision not to tell women that their first test for cancer should have come up as positive.“The toxic culture of concealment and harassment pursued by the HSE and Government against women who have been wronged by the State is now in full public view” she said, urging the Minister to ensure that other affected women are not forced to fight the State through the courts as Phelan and others have been made to do.The Fianna Fáil leader summed up the state of confusion surrounding the story. “Everybody knew but nobody knew, and nobody could tell us anything in the past week. It had to be dragged and drip fed in a frenzied way.”Mary Lou McDonald homed in on the presumption of medics who decide what a woman with terminal cancer needs to know.“They passed away not knowing that their cancer should have been caught earlier, that their treatment programmes, prognosis and possibly their outcomes could have been different. They died unaware that this information was known to the HSE and to others.” It was part of a “a toxic culture of concealment and a refusal to take responsibility within the HSE, a culture in which women are literally allowed to die before fault is admitted.”All day, the questions kept coming for the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health, underlining the sense of confusion and ignorance felt by people trying to fathom the detail of this scandal.It’s creating a sense of worry where there should be none.“Across Ireland today, there are many thousands of women terrified following the revelations about the CervicalCheck screening programme,” said Labour leader, Brendan Howlin. What’s to be done to reassure them?Mary Lou called for the resignation of the head of the HSE, Tony O’Brien.But the Taoiseach said the full facts have yet to emerge, but he is determined to get to the bottom of the issue. He asked for more time. “I think everyone, even Tony O’Brien, deserves a fair hearing.”Whatever we do, it should be based on facts. We are letting women down, and letting people’s health down, in particular, women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on facts.We are really letting people down, particularly the women of Ireland, with regard to women’s health, if we make decisions that are not based on fact.Facts are already out there: the Taoiseach outlined some of them, others were added, such as symphysiotomy, maternal deaths, Brigid McCole, Susie Long . . .And in the chamber, there was the unspoken spectre of the referendum and the further fears of pregnant women who have cancer and how the State might treat them too.The wonderful women of Ireland, so beloved of all TDs in the Dáil.What they don’t know won’t hurt them.What you don’t know won’t hurt us.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017.

We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018Luxembourg meeting condemns \u0026lsquorepeated use\u0026rsquo of chemical weapons by Syrian regime "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3480684.1525202031!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"davis says eu and uk may be unable to resolve border issue before october deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit secretary David Davis  giving evidence to the House of Lords EU committee  on  UK withdrawal from the EU. Photograph:  PA WireBritain and the European Union may be unable to resolve the future of the Border before they agree a deal on their future relationship in October, Brexit secretary David Davis has said. Mr Davis told the House of Lords EU committee that the viability of the first of three options for the Border outlined in last December’s joint report depended on whether Britain and the EU would have a comprehensive free trade agreement.“If we have a tariff-free free trade agreement and a light-touch customs agreement that makes Northern Ireland simpler than if we don’t have those things. So it’s all three we want, because truth be told I would consider it not a success if we were falling back on option C,” he said, referring to the so-called “backstop” that would see Northern Ireland remain in regulatory alignment with the EU after Brexit.“I can see why the Irish Government wants it as a guarantee, but we have to have all three. Now ,whether we can do all that by June, I’m not at all sure. But we are certainly aiming to complete it by October.”Mr Davis admitted that the EU had “pushed back” on the British government’s two proposals for a future customs relationship, confirming a report in the Daily  last month. He said EU negotiators did not understand how a “customs partnership” would work, with Britain collecting tariffs on behalf of the EU, and feared that the other proposal could encourage smuggling.Mr Davis will join other senior ministers on Wednesday for a meeting of the cabinet’s Brexit sub-committee that will focus on options for a customs relationship. Brexiteers want Theresa May to take the “customs partnership” off the table because they fear it is unworkable and could lead to Britain remaining indefinitely in the customs union.International trade secretary Liam Fox said on Tuesday that remaining in the customs union after Brexit would be worse than remaining in the EU itself.“If we were in a customs union with the European Union we would have to accept what the EU negotiated in terms of market access to the UK without the UK having a voice.

Downing Street said the government would offer a “robust” response to a House of Lords vote to\u0026nbspgive MPs the power to stop Britain from leaving the EU without a deal, and to order the prime minister back to the negotiating table if they do not like the deal she secures.The Daily Mail on Tuesday described the Lords as a “house of unelected wreckers”, accusing pro-European peers of acting “in cahoots with Brussels” as they sought to derail Brexit.In the House of Commons on Tuesday, a Conservative MP accused the founder of the pro-Brexit Legatum Institute of being a Russian agent. Bob Seely used parliamentary privilege to quote from Monaco security files that identified Christopher Chandler, a New Zealand-born billionaire, as an object of interest.“According to the French security services as recorded by their colleagues in Monaco, and clearly I am confident that these documents are genuine, Mr Chandler is described as having been ‘an object of interest to the DST since 2002 on suspicion of working for the Russian intelligence services’,” Mr Seely said.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

The plant, known for its sweet scent and delicate clusters of pink flowers, is thought to be the first East Asian rose to reach Europe some time in the 18th century.The scientists, led by Mohammed Bendahmane, from the University of Lyon in France, made comparisons with the genomes of other plants including strawberry, apricot and peach, to explore rose ancestry and evolution.They uncovered more than 36,000 protein-coding genes, and a biochemical pathway that co-ordinated the regulation of scent and colour.A number of candidate genes for flowering were identified which could in future be targeted to produce genetically improved rose cultivars.“If you go to the market and look at the cut roses, they won’t smell like anything. They smell like plastic,” Dr Bendahmane told The Times.A rose on display at the 2016 Hampton Court Flower show“I hope we will be able to change how these flowers look in the future and make them last longer with more of a scent, which is lost the longer roses stay in a vase.“They could also be made more brightly-coloured.”The research, published in the journal Nature Genetics, is expected to help researchers and breeders to manipulate rose flowering and colour, strengthen scent, or increase vase life.Writing in the journal, the scientists said: Reconstructing regulatory and secondary metabolism pathways allowed us to propose a model of interconnected regulation of scent and flower colour.This genome provides a foundation for understanding the mechanisms governing rose traits and should accelerate improvement in roses.A team from the University of Lyon identified the enzyme that helps produce roses\u0027 intoxicating aroma three years ago.They said the key lay in encouraging the roses to produce greater levels of an organic compound called geraniol, which is produced in petals.Arthur Bouquet, an American horticulturalist, claimed that just 50 per cent of today\u0027s roses have a noticeable scent, compared with 75 per cent in the 19th century.Queen flies to Kensington Palace to visit Prince Louis for the first timeGovernment at risk of \u0026#39collapse\u0026#39 as May warned by 60 Tory MPs Brexit customs partnership will sink herPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest news\u0026#39Subversive\u0026#39 Peppa Pig censored in ChinaDramatic video as tornado season gets underway in KansasFinal Benidorm episode to air tonight, as show is axed after 11 yearsComment: Radio shows about making music give me good vibrationsDavid Lidington appeals to Nicola Sturgeon to help deliver orderly Brexit despite no powers dealComment: In taking on Iran, we must not ignore the dangerous terrorists the ayahtollas still sponsorMurder probe launched after man killed in north-west London shootingCarrot-addicted kangaroos attacking visitors at tourist spot near SydneyDonald Trump wrote his own glowing health letter during campaign, claims president\u0026#39s former doctorBBC presenters miss out on top jobs if they have double-barrelled surnames, court hearsBusinessman illegally raised value of home by chopping down protected treesJohn Bercow faces new bullying allegations as former private secretary speaks outCouncil cuts piling pressure on GPs as \u0026#3990 per cent\u0026#39 reduce servicesHaving blood type O almost trebles risk of dying from serious injury, scientists findWHO estimates 7 million die from pollution each year as it reveals latest global air quality figures Tiger cub found in duffel bag at US-Mexico borderThe Split, episode two, recap: All is fair in love and wine for Hannah and her sistersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/01/TELEMMGLPICT000162045964_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqyMcc5edAhhlrd2PuFLMzZOgtdWNmx8g9NFAAAF9gsxk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"boarding school children dominate world work not front screens","story":"Martin Reader, headmaster of the £37,000-a-year Cranleigh School in Surrey, was addressing headteachers at the Boarding School Association’s annual conference in BrightonBoarding school children dominate the world of work because they do not spend time in their bedrooms in front of screens, a leading headmaster has said.Rather than spending hours “hunched” over a computer or television at home, boarding school pupils can spend their time pursuing their passions, according to Martin Reader, headmaster of the £37,000-a-year Cranleigh School in Surrey.Addressing headteachers at the Boarding School Association’s annual conference in Brighton on Tuesday, he said: “When people question why our schools dominate the nations’ sports, creative and performing arts, the professions and politics, it is because they have had time to do those things and time with experts to coach them.“Why sit in a car or on a train or a bus for 45 minutes twice a day, or in a bedroom by yourself hunched over homework or a screen?  “You could be spending those hours rehearsing for a play, having a band practice, spending more time mastering your musical instrument or your goal shooting technique, spending more hours perfecting that painting, debating or discussing politics or science or history – whatever is your passion.”He says boarding school children spend less time “hunched” over a computer or television at homeHe said that he expects sixth-formers to spend 15 hours per week on extra study outside of lessons, as well as extra curricular activities.Rather than spending hours each day commuting to and from school, boarders can pass the time doing “lovely things”.Mr Reader’s comments come after the former Education Secretary said that companies should discriminate against job applicants from Eton because their grades are not as impressive as those achieved by candidates from struggling state schools.Justine Greening,  who quit the cabinet in January after clashing with Theresa May over a review into university tuition fees and support for grammar schools, said that applying contextual recruitment was a far better predictor of potential than grades alone.Justine Greening quit the cabinet in January after clashing with Theresa MayContextual recruitment basically says when you\u0027re looking at someone\u0027s grades who\u0027s applied for a job ... look at them in the context of the school they went to. You can easily do this, there\u0027s software to help you as a company,  Ms Greening told a social mobility conference in New York. Research showed disadvantaged applicants were 50 per cent more likely to be hired after contextual recruitment than otherwise, Ms Greening added, according to the TES magazine.Mr Reader, who is chair of the BSA, said that while social mobility is important, businesses must be left to “make their own decisions” about who they hire and this should not be “dictated” by MPs. “It is not for Government to tell businesses who is the right person for them at the end of the day,” he said.School fees by age groupMr Reader said that another benefit of a boarding school education is the “real face-to-face, social time” rather than pupils at day schools who are used to “virtual socializing” after school and at weekends.He said that many boarding schools restrict social media either through controlling WiFi or limiting the apps that pupils can use.Mr Reader told how his school has banned all mobile phones for pupils aged 13 to 14 as they are “not mature enough” for the technology.“We use to get an incident a week of something unpleasant for that age group but now we\u0027ve had nothing,” he said. “We restrict alcohol and cigarettes as a society because they are addictive so why not restrict something as addictive as a mobile phone.”Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump wrote his own glowing health letter during campaign, claims president\u0026#39s former doctorQueen flies to Kensington Palace to visit Prince Louis for the first timeGovernment at risk of \u0026#39collapse\u0026#39 as May warned by 60 Tory MPs Brexit customs partnership will sink herPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest news\u0026#39Subversive\u0026#39 Peppa Pig censored in ChinaDramatic video as tornado season gets underway in KansasFinal Benidorm episode to air tonight, as show is axed after 11 yearsComment: Radio shows about making music give me good vibrationsDavid Lidington appeals to Nicola Sturgeon to help deliver orderly Brexit despite no powers dealComment: In taking on Iran, we must not ignore the dangerous terrorists the ayahtollas still sponsorMurder probe launched after man killed in north-west London shootingCarrot-addicted kangaroos attacking visitors at tourist spot near SydneyBBC presenters miss out on top jobs if they have double-barrelled surnames, court hearsBusinessman illegally raised value of home by chopping down protected treesJohn Bercow faces new bullying allegations as former private secretary speaks outCouncil cuts piling pressure on GPs as \u0026#3990 per cent\u0026#39 reduce servicesHaving blood type O almost trebles risk of dying from serious injury, scientists findWHO estimates 7 million die from pollution each year as it reveals latest global air quality figures Tiger cub found in duffel bag at US-Mexico borderThe Split, episode two, recap: All is fair in love and wine for Hannah and her sistersWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/09/24/TELEMMGLPICT000109804548_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRw7uKImMqa3-pkk5JsRT8T4CMraT6Pnhm8Lj7_SC9ak.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"last week saw glimpse labour party jeremy corbyn threw away","story":"David Lammy and Yvette Cooper held the Government\u0027s feet to the fire in ways Corbyn can\u0027t As a Chelsea supporter, I have squirmed as Mo Salah and Kevin de Bruyne have ripped apart the opposition over the past few months.

dating tinder f8","story":"Mark Zuckerberg wants to help the 200 million people on Facebook who list themselves as singleMark Zuckerberg has announced a new dating feature for Facebook which he says will deliver strong privacy and safety protections for its users. The unveiling of the new service by the social media site’s CEO was made at the F8 developers conference at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in California on Tuesday.Mr Zuckerberg said more than 200 million people on Facebook list themselves as single and that the new platform would let them connect with people outside of their friends list.Why Facebook might be about to ruin WhatsApp“This is going to be for building real, long-term relationships – not just for hookups,” Mr Zuckerberg said.“We have designed this with privacy and safety in mind from the beginning. Your friends aren’t going to see your profile, and you’re only going to be suggested to people who are not your friends.”The announcement drew a tongue-in-cheek welcome to the competitive online dating field from IAC, whose holdings include platforms like OKCupid and Tinder.“Come on in. The water’s warm. Their product could be great for US-Russia relationships”, CEO Joey Levin said in a statement, referencing the fact that Russian-linked operatives have been accused of using Facebook to widen societal ides and influence the 2016 presidential election.Chief Facebook product officer Chris Cox explained the details of the new dating feature further, saying that it has been in development for a long time.“We were convinced dating would be the next feature Facebook would add,” Mr Cox said, referring to when he first joined Facebook in 2005. “We hope this will allow more folks to meet, and hopefully find partners.”The feature will be opt-in and will be supported through the Facebook app.“People already use Facebook to meet new people, and we want to make that experience better,” Facebook explained. ”People will be able to create a dating profile that is separate from their Facebook profile – and potential matches will be recommended based on dating preferences, things in common, and mutual friends.“They’ll have the option to discover others with similar interests through their Groups or Events. However, what people do within the dating feature will not be shown to their friends. We’ll share more information when this begins testing later this year.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As these movies have gone on, they’ve also become ever-more interlinked, featuring regular cameos, references, and Easter Eggs to other instalments.For newcomers to superhero movies — perhaps those who have become absorbed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) following Black Panther — the amount of material to watch can be overwhelming. But for those wanting to persevere, there are two watching orders. Really, you should probably watch these movies in release order, starting the journey starting with Iron Man — one of the best MCU instalments to date — moving onto The Incredible Hulk, then Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, finishing Phase One with Avengers. This order works well in terms of the post-credit scenes all setting up the next movie and has the intended rhythm formed by producer Kevin Feige.However, many fans have taken to watching the series in chronological order. This might be a little convoluted, but that should not put you off: below is every piece of MCU viewing material mapped out into chronological order including movies, Netflix shows, one-shots (those mini-films you will find in the DVD extras), and other TV shows. 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Agent Carter (seasons one and two)For phase two, things almost play out in release order, except s of the Galaxy Vol. 2 comes directly after the first s, meaning the movie has been moved into Phase Two, despite being a Phase Three release. Ranking the Marvel Cinematic Universe filmsAlso of note, one-shots were phased out during Phase Two with the introduction of the Netflix shows and Agents of Shield. For those who do embark on Agents of Shield (the second and third seasons are great), you should definitely watch along with the movies as they have major effects on the show’s story.All Hail the King (one-shot – Thor: The Dark World)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 1 — 7)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 8 — 16)Agents of Shield (season one: episodes 17 — 22)s of the Galaxys of the Galaxy Vol. 2Agents of Shield (season two: episodes 1 — 19)Avengers: Age of UltronAgents of Shield (season two: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 1 — 19)Made it this far? Well done, you’ve watched a whole lot of Marvel! Phase Three marks some of the best MCU movies so far, but also some timeline bending difficulties. For instance, Doctor Strange begins before Civil War, but finishes after Civil War, Slingshot features lots of flashbacks, and Agents of Shield season five features a lot of obscure time travelling. Also, Black Panther and Spider-Man both take place directly after Civil War, while Ragnarok and Panther directly lead into Avengers: Infinity War. Below’s just a guide for a manageable way of watching based mainly on release order.Agents of Shield (season three: episodes 20 — 22)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 1 — 8)Agents of Shield: Slingshot (web series)Agents of Shield (season four: episodes 9 — 22)Agents of Shield (season five, episodes 1 — 14)Cloak and Dagger (season one)Congratulations. If you’ve watched all of the above, you’ve processed over nine days worth of Marvel movies and television. Nine days! And there’s still more to come, including: Ant Man and The Wasp, Captain Marvel, an untitled fourth Avengers movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming 2, s of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Luke Cage season two, Daredevil season three, The Punisher season two, Iron Fist season two, Jessica Jones season three, and New Warriors season one.

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Others were able to log in but, when they did, some or all of their account details had disappeared.Customers have also reported that they could access other people’s accounts, including account numbers, sort codes and transaction histories.TSB apology after customers complain of online banking ‘data breach’​TSB could not say how many people were still locked out of the service or when the problems would be fully resolved.The ongoing IT disaster began with botched upgrade work on Friday, but has developed into one of the worst technology failures to hit a UK retail bank and has left many of TSB’s 1.9 million customers furious.Some said they were falling behind with bill payments.Others said they were worried their money had simply disappeared.Many customers expressed frustration that the bank was not being clear about what had happened.That came after Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, tweeted on Wednesday morning: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.”Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience and for bearing with us.MPs demanded answers from TSB on Tuesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said: “The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split. Over the weekend, TSB moved customers to a new platform which experienced some teething problems.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This crime is complex and a piecemeal approach will not cut it. Police warn modern slaves ‘staffing nail bars across UK’ as Vietnamese gang jailed in landmark case“The government must get a grip on what works and what doesn’t – when things change, it must be sufficiently informed and agile to respond.”Ms Hillier said long waits for officials to make decisions on whether people should be treated as victims of modern slavery was compounding their distress, while monitoring of support services is poor and there are “worrying variations” in the response of local police forces.“Brexit may complicate the picture further and it is critical that government acts swiftly on the concerns set out in our report,” she added.The Modern Slavery Strategy was introduced in 2014 to reduce the prevalence of practices including human trafficking, forced labour, sexual exploitation and domestic servitude.Gang members who used teenager ‘as a commodity’ to deal drugs jailedAnyone can report potential victims to the National Referral Mechanism for their cases to be assessed, but the system is inefficient and leaves slaves waiting for too long to receive help, the Public Accounts Committee said. Care has been contracted out to the Salvation Army for £90m until 2020, but there are no minimum standards, formal inspections or deadlines for when a decision should be made, with the current average standing at 134 days. The committee warned that prevention work was being damaged by slow progress understanding the crime, which is evolving quickly with changing techniques and nationalities involved. MPs attacked the government’s “hands-off approach” to how businesses comply with laws on transparency in supply chains, which were introduced in 2015, saying monitoring was being left to charities, investors and customers themselves.They said the approach was “clearly not working” because only an estimated 30 per cent of businesses required by law to publish a commitment on the issue have done so. There are also extreme variations between the number of modern slaves being reported by the 43 police forces in England and Wales, varying between more than 900 and fewer than 10 since the National Referral Mechanism started in 2009.MPs said the figures suggested some forces were not treating the issue as seriously as others, with only 6 per cent of related crimes recorded in the year to March 2017 leading to charges and dedicated funding running out in a year’s time.Modern Slavery in the UKModern Slavery in the UKNCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation. Entitled ‘Invisible People’, the exhibition will tour the country as part of the National Crime Agency’s campaign to raise awareness of modern slavery and human trafficking.Child trafficking for sexual exploitation\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Polish or Slovakian men are brought to the UK with the offer of employment and, after arrival, gangmasters seize documents, opening multiple bank and utility accounts in their names – but\u0026#13Labour-intensive sectors like construction, where temporary and irregular work are common, are high-risk sectors for forced labour. With new homes, offices and buildings being constructed or upgraded in great quantity, labour exploitation is the second most common type of modern slavery, after sexual exploitation.\u0026#13In the tough maritime industry young men, often Filipino or Indian, Eastern European or African, are promised a better life, but instead find themselves in a cycle of debt and exploitation.\u0026#13Each year, women from across Eastern Europe and West Africa are lured to the UK by the dream of a better life. Whether by fake migration services or unscrupulous iniduals who befriend and then betray them, women fall into a dark spiral of sexual exploitation and forced, unpaid prostitution, unable to escape.\u0026#13The cannabis industry hides a dark secret in the house next door. Gangs bring young boys to the UK from countries like Vietnam and deliver them to a house where, once in, they won’t be able to leave. Forced to tend cannabis plants that fill specially rigged houses, the boys are often locked in and forced to work, sleep and eat in one confined and dirty room. The chemicals used on the cannabis are poisonous, and often victims don’t know where they are or how to get help if they do escape. The eyes, ears and compassion of the local community are essential.\u0026#13Some workers in the farming sector, harvesting grains or root vegetables, tending livestock or fruit picking, are being exploited every day in the UK.\u0026#13Spot the signs of forced prostitution:\u0026#13Spot the signs of exploitative labour in the maritime sector:\u0026#13Photographer Rory Carnegie, said: “This image communicates utter exhaustion and dejection. We can see how dire his situation is. He has no protective gear on, and we can see the extreme tiredness that leads him to a place of anxiety and distraction, where he doesn’t care about whether he’s operating machinery safely, or putting himself at risk.”The exhibition comprises a series of large, freestanding cubes displaying images capturing snapshots of life within different types of modern slavery - in agriculture, construction, maritime, cannabis farming and food processing, child trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.\u0026#13The committee said the Home Office must work with groups including the National Crime Agency, Crown Prosecution Service and independent anti-slavery commissioner to urgently develop a set of practical steps tackling regional gaps.It demanded “immediate action” to enforce rules on transparency in supply chains, potentially including publishing a list of firms who are not complying.MPs called on the Home Office to ensure a reformed referral mechanism is in place by January next year, cut waiting times, bring in standards for victim care and a means of tracking the amount of public money spent.The committee also said better understanding was needed to prevent modern slavery and work must take account of the potential impact of Brexit. Police failure to tackle modern slavery laid bareThe Local Government Association said the National Referral Mechanism could not manage the number of cases, which has almost trebled since 2013, and backed calls for reforms.The chair of its Safer and Stronger Communities Board, Simon Blackburn, said: “These reforms must be backed up with resources. “Councils can play a key role in supporting trafficking victims, but we would like to see the government provide clarity over how local authorities are expected to respond and for these responsibilities to be properly funded.”The Public Accounts Committee report came four months after a separate probe by the National Audit Office found the government’s bid to tackle modern slavery was ineffective, calling its strategy “unclear” and “inadequate”.A previous warning came from HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in October, when the watchdog found police forces were failing to identify victims and leaving perpetrators free to continue to exploit them.The UK is the first country in the world to have dedicated legislation in place to tackle modern slavery and there are more than 600 live modern slavery police operations underway.A Home Office spokesperson said: “The Public Accounts Committee recognises that the UK is ahead of many countries in responding to modern slavery and the government’s Modern Slavery Taskforce will consider its recommendations carefully. “We have recently announced reforms to the National Referral Mechanism to make sure it supports more victims at a quicker pace and we are taking action to eradicate modern slavery from the economy, including requiring large businesses to report on how they are tackling and preventing this crime in their supply chains.”And last April, the Work and Pensions Committee found that “inexcusable” shortcomings in the UK’s modern slavery strategy were leaving victims reduced to destitution while their abusers escaped because they were not adequately supported to testify against them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

expressed its strong disappointment at the defeats inflicted on the EU Withdrawal Bill in the House of Lords, saying they risk tying the government’s hands behind its back in negotiations with Brussels.“The prime minister said that when the bill returns to the House of Commons the government would be robust.March for a People’s Vote: campaigners call for march on Westminster to demand fresh public vote on Brexit“She said it was vital to ensure the legislation is able to deliver the smooth Brexit which is in the interest of everybody in the United Kingdom.”  Ms May has said she will give

citizens registerBrexit result tainted by Cambridge Analytica scandal, says Tory MPWhat the Sainsbury’s-Asda merger says about Brexit EU gives Britain June deadline on Northern Ireland border issueCross-party backing for motion to give parliament more say on Brexit Given that the government’s own economic projections suggest this would be the worst possible outcome for the country, critics have accused Ms May of using the threat as leverage to get MPs to back her deal regardless of what it is.But the amendment passed by the Lords to Ms May’s EU Withdrawal Bill on Monday, would mean that if her deal is rejected, then it is parliament that will decide what happens next – with any option open.The prime minister’s spokesman said: “What the amendment which was passed last night would do, is weaken the UK’s hand in our Brexit negotiations by giving parliament unprecedented powers to instruct the government to do anything with regard to the negotiations – including trying to keep the UK in the EU indefinitely.”But twice asked if the prime minister is confident she actually has the numbers in the Commons to reverse changes, the spokesman said only that it is in the “interests of the Houses of Parliament” to allow the government to deliver Brexit.Tusk: Brexit is ‘one of the saddest moments’ in recent European historyMs May has already suffered a defeat at the hands of Tory rebels in the Commons, meanwhile the next stages of other pieces of Brexit legislation have been delayed because the government is unsure it can defeat amendments placed by Conservative backbenchers.However, the No 10 spokesman said the government is determined to have EU Withdrawal Bill passed in the same state that it left the Commons the first time round, indicating that it will try and overturn all of the changes imposed by the Lords.It has suffered seven defeats in the Lords in recent weeks, imposing changes to its legislation which if left untouched could lead the way to keeping the UK in a customs union, keeping the EU’s charter of fundamental rights and restricting the “Henry VIII” powers, which the Bill gives to ministers to make new laws without full parliamentary scrutiny.Brexit talks to resume this week after EU warning on Irish borderThe cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee will meet to discuss the vexed issue of post-Brexit customs relations on Wednesday, with at least one of its members having suggested they will quit if the UK remains in a customs union with the EU.International trade secretary Liam Fox hinted strongly that he would resign if the prime minister gives way to pressure in parliament and opts for closer customs relations with the EU after Brexit. He refused to answer the question directly over whether he would quit, but added: “Getting no answer you can draw your own inferences.”Foreign secretary Boris Johnson is also said to have considered quitting over the issue, though close aides deny it.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He added: “Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!”China is North Korea’s sole major ally, but trade has declined by about 90 per cent after Beijing implemented economic sanctions due to Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile tests.In March Mr Kim visited China by train, meeting Mr Xi and the pair – according to the state-run China Daily – agreed a plan to develop relations between the two countries, and to address the North’s nuclear programme.The 36-year-old dictator is anticipated to meet Mr Trump at some point in May or early June, though no date has been announced for the encounter the Republican accepted on the spur of the moment earlier this year.On Twitter Mr Trump suggested he was considering the Peace House, on the border between North and South Korea, as the intended location. It is where last week’s summit between Mr Moon and Mr Kim was held.He tweeted: “Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace HouseFreedom House, on the Border of North \u0026amp South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?

Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang quickly matched the South’s action with its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. Seoul’s announcement came a day after it said Mr Kim had told Mr Moon during the summit that he would shut down his country’s only known nuclear testing site and allow outside experts and journalists to watch the process.Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you let your child be their own person then she probably wouldn’t make the same decisions I did.More poignant, however, is the revelation that Jade was sexually assaulted when she was 16 – at a time when she had never even kissed a boy.Understandably the traumatic experience had a profound effect on her.Anything that happens to someone at a young age when boys cross the line it is going to affect you, she says now.Afterwards I was having sex a fair amount and I thought that was all I was worth.Getting into the porn industry allowed me to mature, to grow into myself, she says.When I got into this, there were people telling me I was beautiful and it brought me out of my shell, it made me believe in myself more than I ever did before.It’s given me independence and self-esteem.On some level I’m the last person you would think works in the adult industry – but often it’s the girls you never would have expected having sex for a living, like the quiet ones you used to see sat in the library with a book.Jade wasn’t quite that girl, although she describes herself as a naïve teenager. She won’t discuss her family, although she describes her upbringing as perfect.By the age of 13 however, she was already watching porn online.Boys in the playground at school were using all these sexual terms. I didn’t have a clue what those words meant so I started looking things up on the internet, she says.It was curiosity really. We’re the generation that’s grown up with the internet, with online pornography, it’s more normalised for our age group.Initially a more traditional career path beckoned though: Jade was accepted on a fashion degree course in Manchester and embarked on student life in the city.But as her student loan started to run out she took an unorthodox route to topping up her funds.I tried everything I could to get a traditional job to get some extra cash but every job in retail I applied for there were to 200 applicants for, she insists.Then a guy I’d met online suggested I sell some pornographic pictures and videos.I already had some on my phone from previous boyfriends so it wasn’t a big leap.Suddenly I had £100 in my bank account every few weeks and I could go shopping and it made me happy.Then, aged 19, she received an email from a website asking if she’d like to make a pornographic film. I said yes, that I would absolutely love to, she says.The basic shoot involved a very simple boy meets girl scene. I had no idea what to expect but I wasn’t nervous, she insists.I knew nothing though - I turned up with just the clothes on my back. I remember them asking me where my underwear and outfit options were. But I enjoyed it.Quickly, it seems, Jade found that performing porn gave her a sense of self-worth that had been missing from her life: she describes her student days as lonely and depressed and says that her newfound porn career gave her confidence.Nonetheless, it’s clear she has gone through experiences which made her unhappy, some of which unfold in the documentary.In one scene, in which her male co-star is struggling to perform Jade can be seen having a panic attack as she worries about filming with him again.In another more shocking incident, she confides that she has been bleeding after suffering a tear in her vagina after a vigorous sex session – yet feels she has no choice but to have sex with the same man on camera again. It’s my job, she says to camera.Today she does not want to dwell on these incidents, saying they are in the past. It was the start of what would become, post graduation, a full-time porn career, travelling to shoots all over Europe – among them Prague, Budapest, Spain, Austria.For two years I didn’t see my bed for more than about three days in a row. she says. But I found it very fulfilling. It gave me independence in a way that getting coffees as an intern in the fashion industry could never do.And while the pay wasn’t huge – some shoots pay £500 a day, some much less, with an hourly rate of around £12 - it was enough for her, by the age of 21, to rent her own city centre flat.She was also able to fund a boob job, something she calls her 21st birthday present to myself.I didn’t do it for men, she insists. I wanted to balance my body out. I went from a small B to a DD. I wanted that perfect rounded shape.She insists that she’s never had a bad experience or felt vulnerable. When I first started out I did some things I’m not proud of - someone was a bit rough with me, she says.But it was because I was bottom of the ladder. Now in terms of what I do on set everything is agreed on before I arrive.If I think a guy is going too hard I will just tell him to stop and they always respect it.Like all sex workers, she has regular sexual health checks as 90 percent of sex takes place without protection. So far, she has emerged unscathed.Years later, she now says that it is her work in porn, not real relationships, that give her a sense of self-worth.In my professional life men treat me with nothing but admiration and respect. But I find in real life that’s not the case, she says.It’s one reason she has decided to remain single for the foreseeable future, describing herself as asexual.It’s just easier this way, she says. One ex-boyfriend was fine with it at first but then got jealous.It’s just easier to have either porn or a boyfriend, you can’t really have both at the same time.Her friends, meanwhile, are aware of what she does but are unfazed.They’ve known me a long time and they know I enjoy being outlandish. It wasn’t the biggest shock to them.Again this description seems at odds with the portrait of the naïve and lonely girl that Jade also likes to paint of her past self.Either way, today Jade likes to think of herself as an entrepreneur as well as a porn performer.She has given up travelling to shoots and instead works from her Manchester flat creating her own content, which she sells to subscribers.I work three days a week from my own home and while I’m not rich I’m not poor. For me it’s not about the money, she says. It’s about doing something I enjoy.Is there a sell-by date on what she does? Who knows?, she asks. I live each day by the day. What about regret in the future? After all, the 60-year-old Jade might feel differently about what she did as a young girl.Maybe but I don’t think so, she says. I like to think that I’ll enjoy seeing how hot I was.I am proud of what I do. I honestly think that discovering the porn industry made me the person I am today, and I couldn’t be more grateful.Jade features in Jade: Why I Chose Porn on BBC iPlayer and Things Not To Say To Someone Who Works In Porn on BBC Three’s YouTube channelOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s.

And this is true across the animal kingdom - its not limited to primates - and humans do the same thing.When we feel powerless we do exactly the opposite.We close up and make ourselves small.But its not just about projecting power over other people - Amy says we can fake it till we make it and convince ourselves that we are more confident and dominant just by consciously adopting a bold power stance.When you pretend to be powerful, you are more likely to actually feel powerful, she explains.Powerful people tend to be more assertive, confident and optimistic, and they take more risks.The body can shape the mind. In her own research, Amy has taken groups of people and asked them to adopt high or low-power poses, without telling them why.The famous legs-spread Tory stance is an example of a high-power pose, while low-power poses could include seated positions with the limbs tucked in.After two minutes in this pose, subjects were asked to play a gambling game, and the choices of the high-power and low-power groups were compared.Cuddy found that 85 per cent of the people primed by just two minutes in a power pose were prepared to take risks, while just 60 per cent of the low-power group took the same risks.By swabbing the mouth before and after a two-minute pose, researchers also found that testosterone, the male sex hormone associated with physical strength, increases by 20 per cent after adopting a high-power pose.This is true of both men and women, meaning anyone can gain a rush of masculine power just by standing with your legs spread.And on the flip side, testosterone levels tend to dip by around 10 per cent after two minutes spent in a low-power pose.Meanwhile, cortisol levels, which are associated with stress, decrease after a few minutes in a dominant pose, and rise after taking a cowering, submissive pose.In another test, Cuddy put a group of people through a mock job interview, with half of the group spending a few minutes in a power pose before they went in, and the other half adopting a low-power pose while waiting for the interview to start.She found that the people who had prepared with a power pose were more likely to get positive feedback from the test interview - suggesting that power stances can be useful to boost your own confidence, as well as to project your confidence to the world.By taking an exaggerated Javid-style power stance (sometimes dubbed the Wonder Woman pose) before you go into a meeting or give a speech you can improve your own confidence and presence.It can also make you come across as more comfortable, passionate and authentic - which explains why its so popular among big-name politicians.However, Cuddy explains that youre not necessarily meant to strike this exaggerated power pose while youre delivering a big speech - as Tory ministers are prone to doing.Its more something which you should do for yourself, in private, to gee yourself up before a big event.As Cuddy says: For two minutes before you go into a high-stress situation, try doing this: in an elevator, in a bathroom stall or at your desk, behind closed doors.Configure your brain to do the best in that situation and get your testosterone up.Of course, you dont have to be a government minister to benefit from this psychological boost - anyone can try a few minutes of power posing before a stressful or intimidating event.Just take a moment to privately adopt a big, space-hogging Alpha pose, and youll find that youre that bit more calm and composed when it comes to crunch time.Cuddy says: Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. You dont just fake it till you make it, you can actually fake it until you become it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They told her that I was wanted by the Home Office for deportation.“She told me that she had to suspend me because they had told her that that they could be prosecuted and fined if they kept me on the books.”It then took him several days to get through to the Home Office - leaving him unable to work during that time.He said that when he got through: “I explained the situation.I was hysterical. I told him that the idea of me being deported to Uganda was ridiculous.“I was passed on to a manager who said that they had no idea how or why it had happened.”Amber Rudd resigned as Home Secretary on Sunday night in the wake of the Windrush generation crisis.Today it was claimed that up to 7,000 foreign students may have been wrongly accused of cheating and kicked out of Britain.A spokesman for the Home Office said: “Mr Herbert was sent a letter in May 2015 incorrectly warning that he was the subject of enforcement action.“When the mistake was identified in October 2015, we wrote to Mr Herbert to acknowledge the error and apologise.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402206917.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pension watchdog faces calls to investigate sainsburys tie up with asda to stop workers being left out of pocket","story":"Labour’s Frank Field called on Sainsbury’s chief Mike Coupe - panned for singing We’re in the Money over the deal – to prove that staff won’t be left out of pocket once the merger is complete.And he said the regulator also had to be given a veto on the historic supermarket deal.Speaking to The Sun, Mr Field, head of the cross-party Commons Work and Pension Committee said: “The living standard of hundreds of thousands of worker and pensioners are on the line.“Given that both companies’ pension schemes have significant accounting deficits, it seems to be as clear as day that the deal should proceed only once it’s been cleared by The Pensions Regulator.”The Labour campaigner said Sainsbury’s had a near £1billion black hole in its pension scheme while Asda’s was almost £900million in the red.Sainsbury’s is washing its hands of Asda’s scheme under the merger plans – with the obligation for funding Asda retirement pots left with former owner, US giant Walmart.Walmart will get £3billion in cash under the merger.In a letter to Mike Coupe, Mr Field asks if there is any specific provision under the deal to include a “specific provision” for Sainsbury’s pension scheme members.And he asks: “What risk analysis have you undertaken regarding the deal’s impact on the covenant underpinning the Sainsbury’s defined benefit regimes?”Frank Field’s Commons Ccmmittee went to war with Sir Philip Green over the collapse of BHS. The billionaire in February agreed to write a £363million cheque to shore up the high street chain’s pension fund.Last month, the Government dropped plans to give the Pensions Regulator power to stop mergers or takeovers that threaten the solvency of a UK retirement fund. The power would have worked in a similar way to the “fit and proper person” test applied by the Football Association on foreign takeovers of English clubs.Explaining the U-turn, Government sources explained that Ministers had sought to strike a balance between supporting pensioners and allowing British companies to “grow and prosper”.Mr Coupe was caught singing We’re in the Money on TV as Sainsbury’s shares soared 17 per cent on the merger plan with long-time rival Asda.The chief exec didn’t realise his rendition of the Gold Diggers’ Song was being recorded by ITV. Mr Coupe said he was trying to compose himself before an interview on ITV about the merger.It came as critics claimed the merger could lead to widespread store closures and job losses – as well as a thumping for suppliers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But if we don’t get access, we will find an alternative.”The Commission wrote to ministers in January saying Britain would not be able to stay in the Galileo satellite system for data security reasons.But that letter is being kept under lock and key in the Secretariat General, which is now run by all-powerful German official Martin Selmayr who has taken a hard line on Brexit.And it is understood that chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his team were left out of the process as the Commission insisted Britain will be cut adrift after we’ve left.The revelations came after diplomats from the 27 Member States gathered last Thursday to discuss the latest Brexit developments.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “The UK has sent a letter to the Commission outlining its wishes and the Commission has reacted to that not from Barnier’s end but from the Secretariat-Gerneral’s.“That [Commission] letter has never been seen by the Member States.”A second EU diplomat confirmed: “We’d like to get a copy of the letter that was sent to the UK.”A Commission source said the meeting had focussed on the security-related aspects of shutting the UK out of Galileo, a move which could cost British businesses hundreds of millions of pounds worth of contracts.Defence secretary Gavin Williamson has reacted furiously to the Commission’s snub and ministers are now mulling building our own rival satellite.But one EU diplomat added: “I think in the end the two parties will reach an agreement so that the UK can still participate in it.“The UK is leaving and that has consequences — you can’t expect everything to just keep on going on the same footing. But this is a negotiation and it’s still ongoing.”The £8.8 billion Galileo satellite is a rival to America’s GPS system and plays an especially important role in military operations. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My particular interest is in education and in health.There needs to be a voice for older people - about a quarter of people in their 80s and 90s are in homes or being cared for, so that leaves three-quarters who are looking after themselves.Miss Kirkby is a long-time member of the Carers Association and said elderly people who are not in need of urgent medical care are often isolated and in need of other kinds of support.When you hear about older people (in the media) its usually that there are too many of them and they are absorbing all the resources of the health service. Theres no acknowledgement about what they can contribute, she said.I thought it was time there was somebody who could take a stand.The candidate spent her entire career in education, having first worked as an English teacher at secondary level before going on to become headmistress of several schools.She also served on the governing body of Newcastle University and in 2013 she was awarded an MBE for services to education.Education today is the same as it has always been - controversial. There have been huge advances but theres always room for improvement, she said.Miss Kirkby was involved in politics from a young age as her father was one of the early members of the Labour Party in Manchester and was a close friend of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst.When asked how her father would feel about her standing for the Conservatives, she joked that in later life he had abandoned some of his youthful ideals and ended up investing in property.You start off young and full of optimism, then in middle age you get a bit more realistic about what you can achieve, she said.Born in 1921, Miss Kirkby was 18 when the Second World War broke out, and spent most of the war years teaching in Blackpool where many of her students were evacuees.She said the war made her realise just how important democracy is.GOT a story?

I want to make sure we have got the freedom to carry out an independent trade policy, we cannot have our hands tied”.Mr Davis told the House of Lords there would be 45 different issues to hammer out with Brussels before a trade deal can be forged.And he said London was pushing to have these all negotiated at the same time rather than one after the other, as otherwise he would be “dead and buried” by the time the deal was struck.Giving evidence to the Lords EU Select Committee, the Brexit Secretary insisted that the terms of the trade deal agreed with Brussels by October this year must contain more than just “airy fairy aims”.But he conceded that agreement has not yet been reached on the structure of how trade talks will take place beyond a round of face to face talks in Brussels this week.However he insisted “nothing keeping him awake at night” yet and he was confident it could be done in time.Meanwhile he publicly admitted for the first time that Brussels had “pushed back” on Theresa May’s plans for a new Customs Partnership with the EU.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Margaret Thatcher sent two aircraft carriers – HMS Hermes and HMS Invincible – to help take back the Falklands in 1982.They were accompanied by an array of British destroyers, frigates and subs. A new £3.5 billion HMS Queen Elizabeth carrier is nearing the end of its trials and a second HMS Prince of Wales is still under construction.But critics claim at least ten more escort ships are also needed. Challenged yesterday, Sir Mark signalled the intention was only ever to use both carriers as part of an international taskforce when they are operational.Speaking to MPs on the cross-party Defence Committee, he said: “We will see what happens in the circumstances but that is part of the thinking about the use of the carriers“It is projecting them as a British sovereign capability but one that will almost inevitably - I would actually say inevitably - be used in a context of allied operations of some kind if used in a contested environment.”Lord West said it was clear the Government need to “put its money where its mouth is”. “I have always said we should have 30 escorts – indeed that number came out of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998. We have 19.”He stormed: “There may well be an occasion where we have to do something on our own. We would cobble together whatever taskforce we could. But we haven’t spent enough on escorts.”Downing Street last night insisted that Britain’s Navy did have enough ships.A spokesman said: “We are clear that our aircraft carriers are a sovereign capability and that we have the ships to allow them to deploy independently.“What the National Security Adviser was saying was that we are a member of Nato and have close defence relationships with allies and so such a scenario is unlikely.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They said it was unclear why we lose our ability to pick up languages after 18.Scientists suggest it may be due to brain changes – or becoming too busy to learn.Researcher Josh Tenenbaum, an MIT professor of brain and cognitive sciences, said: “It’s possible that there’s a biological change. It’s also possible that it’s something social or cultural. There’s roughly a period of being a minor that goes up to about age 17 or 18 in many societies.“After that, you leave your home, maybe you work full time, or you become a specialised university student.

I actually tried going back to work - I did a bit of consultancy, and also had a part-time job at a small start-up local to me.But it didn\u0027t work for me. I loved the work and the people, but for some reason having to be at a set place at a set time, and feeling guilty whether I was at work or home that I should be doing the other, really set my PND off again. So in the end I left as I felt I was letting them down.It was the best decision I made though. As soon as I felt the weight of work off my shoulders I could concentrate on getting better.Since then I have been creating my own silver lining. I am now on a mission to ensure that no other mum should have to feel like I did. This started by speaking out about my experience.I also found that loneliness can be a cause of PND and other mental health issues, so I am excited that my MummyLinks App, designed as a safe place to meet mums for local playdates, is launching this summer.This week I also launched the #ShoutieSelfie campaign on social media to support and encourage people to get talking about mental health during and after pregnancy.Out of three mums, one will be struggling with a mental health issue.Do you know which of your friends who are mums are struggling?"},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/16/04/2048x1152/rbs-1-2048x1536_3443150.jpg?20160405114748 ","title":"revealed how many hours it takes to make a friend","story":"Hours spent working together just don\u0027t count as much. You can spend over 250 hours with someone at work over three months and still feel they are just an acquaintance.No wonder it is so hard to make new friends, especially after university.No wonder children and work make it difficult to do this. Who has the time?No wonder we want to make relationships move faster by sharing intimacy and connection online.Yet, my study only counted co-present - not mediated - time. After a friendship is established, mediated moments of social interaction (like those spent on Facebook) can make a difference.Don\u0027t just take it from me.David Ginsberg, director of research at Facebook, notes: \"When people are engaging with people they\u0027re close to, it\u0027s more meaningful, more fulfilling. It\u0027s good for your well-being.\" Facebook\u0027s own research concludes that direct social interaction with people who matter most to us makes the biggest difference. But you have to make those friends first.I guess like everything in this life, if you want friends (and truly they are the best), you need to put in a lot of hours in their company. You have to work at it.This project draws from ideas advanced by University of Oxford researcher Robin Dunbar who established that a person\u0027s brain can only handle about 150 friendships.The amount of time and the type of activity shared with a friend is often pleasurable in its own right, but it is also a strategic investment in the future of feeling included and connected in one\u0027s social circle.My second study followed 112 University of Kansas first years for nine weeks.I asked them about two people they had met since starting school two weeks before, and then I checked up with them four and seven weeks later to see how those two relationships had progressed.In both studies I asked participants to describe their new relationships in one of four deepening stages: acquaintance, casual friend, friend, and close friend.Then I estimated the statistical cut-point, or the place where people began to transition from one level of friendship to another.Combining the results of both studies, I estimate it takes between 40 and 60 hours to form a casual friendship, 80-100 hours to transition to being a friend, and more than 200 hours to become close friends.Of course, it\u0027s not simply a matter of wanting to be friends with someone. The other person has to want it, too.And younger people would be wise to make that investment of time: friendship earlier in life is associated with happiness later in life. Although you can\u0027t make people spend time with you, you can invite them.Make it a priority to spend time with potential friends. If you are interested in a friendship, switch up the context. If you work together, go to lunch or out for a drink.These things signal to people that you are interested in being friends with them.The message is clear: we have to put that time in. You can\u0027t snap your fingers and make a friend.And it is very important to prioritise friendships. Maintaining close relationships is the most important investment of our time we can make - most people on their deathbeds agree."}]
