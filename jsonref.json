The certificates were initially needed to enter many cultural and leisure venues, but their scope has gradually been widened. Last month, the government made it compulsory for all workers.  Thousands of people took to the streets of the Italian capital on Saturday to oppose the move.  Some tried to break past police in riot gear guarding access to Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s office, while a separate group broke into the headquarters of Italy’s main CGIL trade union and turned its offices upside down.  Overnight, dozens of protesters also tried to break into the accident and emergency unit at Rome’s Policlinico Umberto I hospital, where one of them was being kept for treatment, forcing health workers to barricade themselves inside, emergency department head Francesco Pugliese told reporters on Sunday.  “It was a fascist squad attack, and it is unacceptable,” CGIL’s head Maurizio Landini said on Sunday, speaking to supporters in front of the union offices in Rome.  The riots drew widespread condemnation, including from Matteo Salvini and Giorgia Meloni, the leaders of the rightist League and Brothers of Italy parties, respectively.

According to a government website showed 43,229,551 people over-12, out of a total population of around 60 million, had completed their vaccination cycle as of 10 October. “That’s a critical level above which experts say - and the trend we’ve been recording for weeks confirms this – that the risk of hospitalisation is drastically reduced”, the commissioner’s office said. Italy was a harbinger for Europe in the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020 with the rest of the continent watching on in horror as they realised what was unfolding in Italy was soon to befall on their own shores.“This isn’t how we normally treat an endemic disease so I think the answer to that is very clearly no. We’re taking it extremely seriously. “So we are starting to move to a situation where, perhaps Covid is not the most significant element and many of those iniduals affected will of course have other comorbidities which will make them vulnerable to serious illness for other reasons as well.”She said: “We’ve obviously had extremely good vaccine uptake and that is now preventing very significant amounts of hospitalisation and death.” She added: “Probably the difficulty is at this point in the pandemic, it’s one of the most difficult times to predict what will come. “We have different levels of vaccination, we have a little bit of immunity waning in older iniduals, which is why we’re now starting to put in a Covid booster vaccine. “We have slightly different effectiveness in different vaccinations that have been provided.”She told Sky: “The difference here is because we have, if you like, skipped a year almost with flu, it’s possible we might see multi-strain flu. “We usually get one strain predominating. We look to the southern hemisphere, who hits winter sooner than we do. “So we’ve got a pretty good array in our toolbox to try and hit whichever one becomes dominant but it could be more than one this year, and people’s immunity will be lower. “So I think the real trick here is to get vaccinated – in both Covid and flu – but obviously to continue to do those good hygiene behaviours that we’ve been practising all through Covid.”The UK Health Security Agency chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, said there is lower immunity to flu this year. “But I think the important thing about this winter is, we are likely to see flu, for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with Covid. “So the risks of catching both together still remain. And if you do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together, than just having Covid alone. “So I think it’s an uncertain winter ahead – that’s not a prediction it’s an uncertain feature – but we do know that flu cases have been lower in the previous year so immunity and the strain types are a little more uncertain.”Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said the government has agreed to allow fully vaccinated Malaysians to travel overseas without applying for permission.

Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

These arrangements along with leasing from the private sector and subsidising rents to private landlords was “not good policy and it is not in line with the social housing policy in most other countries,” Mr Desmond said. He wrote that “this misguided strategy” has left housing in Ireland “prey to greedy developers and international investors”.“Allowing the private market to dictate the price of social housing is a shocking mismanagement of public funds – you might as well hand out blank cheques,” he wrote.“It is astounding that Government cannot see this and persists in pursuing what is clearly a deeply flawed national housing model to the detriment of all.”The letters were first published on Sunday by the Business Post which obtained them under the Freedom of Information Act. In a follow-up meeting between Mr Desmond and Mr O’Brien on April 1st, the businessman repeated his arguments and told the minister that the Part V legislation was “unwieldy and complicated” and that foreign investors get the benefit of guaranteed lease returns when it would be preferable if the properties belonged to local authorities.According to a minute of that meeting, Kevin Dillon, one of Mr O’Brien’s advisers, “accepted the point that the State was losing out somewhat”.He explained that this had arisen “due to the requirement for off-balance sheet accounting, the temporary lifting of which was due to Covid”.In his December 2020 letter to Mr O’Brien, Mr Desmond said that the State should be innovative in a world where the State’s National Treasury Management Agency was “almost being paid to borrow money”.“You have the opportunity to make home ownership affordable and to make money for the State,” he said. He was a strong advocate of home ownership, but “policy making is your purview, not mine,” he told the Minister. “What I do understand is finance and what is happening at the moment from an Ireland Inc perspective is insane,” he wrote.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"uk has put up red line barrier to progress in negotiations with eu coveney says","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney arriving at Government Buildings, Dublin, for a Cabinet meeting on Thursday.

But there needs to be significant change to the current situation if there is to be a positive outcome,” he added.European Commission proposals to resolve issues with the protocol are expected to be presented on Wednesday.On Thursday, EC vice-president Maros Sefcovic said it would finalise measures next week aimed at resolving the post-Brexit arrangements for the North by the end of the year or early 2022.But he again cautioned that he would not renegotiate the protocol, and that solutions would have to be found within the terms of the deal.The protocol, agreed between London and Brussels as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, has created a de facto trade border for some goods moving between the North and Britain.Checks are being carried out on the Irish Sea to ensure goods coming into the North meet EU standards, so as to protect the EU single market and avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.Unionist political leaders are united in their opposition to the arrangements.Writing in the Daily , DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the EU needs to make “concrete legislative changes that deal with all the problems Northern Ireland faces because of the protocol, whether that is in agrifood, manufacturing or on our supermarket shelves”.Without sufficient changes to the deal, Mr Donaldson again threatened to collapse the Stormont Assembly and trigger an election to “let the public have their say on the Irish Sea border”.“The last number of weeks have sent a clear message to the European Union that, if they really believe in stability and protecting the progress made in Northern Ireland, then they need to think again,” he said.In his speech on Tuesday, Mr Frost is also expected to say endless negotiation is not an option.“No one should be in any doubt about the seriousness of the situation ... The EU now needs to show ambition and willingness to tackle the fundamental issues at the heart of the protocol head on,” the speech transcript said.“The UK-EU relationship is under strain, but it doesn’t have to be this way. By putting the protocol on a durable footing, we have the opportunity to move past the difficulties of the past year.” - additional reporting by Reuters How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: AFPGettyCzech voters today evicted the communists from parliament for the first time since the end of the second World War, voting out a party whose forebears had ruled the central European nation from 1948 until the Velvet Revolution of 1989 that ushered in democracy.The communists jailed tens of thousands in forced labour camps in the 1950s and brutally repressed dissidents such as playwright-turned-president Vaclav Havel, but remained in parliament following the revolution in the then Czechoslovakia.In this week’s election, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia took 3.62 per cent of the votes with nearly all precincts reporting, less than the 5 per cent needed to enter parliament. This potentially marks a final chapter for a party that has gradually shrunk as its ageing membership has dwindled.“It pleases me, it pleases me a lot,” Jiri Gruntorad (69), a former dissident who signed the dissident Charter 77 statement and was jailed for subversion from 1981 to 1985 by the communist authorities, told Reuters. “But it’s coming too late.“It was one of the last communist parties in the world apart from the Chinese and Cuban ones that held on to its name. The others have at least renamed themselves and started behaving a little differently.”Surprise resultVoters also handed a defeat to prime minister Andrej Babis’s ANO party, giving their backing to centre-right opposition group Together in a surprise result.After 1989, the communists sought to appeal to senior citizens and working class Czechs, but they never resonated with younger voters and failed to shake off the party’s history as totalitarian rulers who had stifled freedom.“I am very disappointed because it is a really big failure,” said Communist Party leader Vojtech Filip, who also resigned.Mr Havel opposed banning the party – which had resisted the country’s European Union and Nato membership and kept warm ties with Russia and China – despite calls from the public to do so.The communists lingered mostly in isolation after 1989, though they co-operated with other parties seeking votes to pass legislation in parliament. They were also close to current President Milos Zeman.The party regained influence in 2018 when Mr Babis – a former Communist Party member – leaned on them to support his minority government with the Social Democrats.It was the closest the party came to power since 1989, but appears also to represent their final act as a political force in the former Soviet-bloc nation.“I am overjoyed that this era is now over – not only for those of us still living, but also for those who have passed away and who were persecuted by the regime,” said Hana Palcova (74), who left the country under threat from the secret police. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"merkel urges iran to return to the negotiating table over its nuclear programme","story":" Angela Merkel at  a reception outside the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem:  “This is a very critical situation.

The US has warned time is running out to revive a 2015 accord with Iran that would lift sanctions in return for limiting its nuclear work. A sixth round of negotiations ended inconclusively in June and no date’s been set for the next one after a transition of power in Iran complicated diplomacy. The international community is in a very difficult situation, Merkel said on Sunday. Although the administration of US President Joe Biden has sought a return to the deal, “the days go by without Iran giving any indications that it wants to restart the talks” while it continues sensitive uranium enrichment work. Highly enriched uranium could be used to build a nuclear bomb. “This is a very critical situation,” she said at a news conference in Jerusalem with Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett. “There are very, very decisive weeks ahead of us.”Western countries and Israel suspect the programme is aimed at making a bomb Iran denies this. “The message to Iran is unambiguous: There must be a quick return to the negotiating table,” Ms Merkel said. “The original deal was not ideal but it was better than nothing,” she added. Mr Bennett reiterated Israel’s position that a revived nuclear accord would embolden Iran. Ms Merkel, who will leave office soon, said the new German government would remain committed to Israel’s security, a position it has taken for decades to try to atone for the country’s Nazi past. She also said, however, Israel’s settlement policy has made a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict difficult. – BloombergStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Fears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"airlines could grounded pilot shortage hundreds retire change","story":"Britain faces a shortage of pilots when full flight schedules resume after hundreds of airline crew retired or switched careers during the Covid pandemic, with many others requiring retraining.Ministers fear a potential shortfall in pilot numbers could hamper the return to pre-pandemic numbers of flights following a devastating 19 months for aviation. Experts have suggested the industry faces a global shortage of some 34,000 pilots by 2025.Aviation sources said the number of pilots who retired during the pandemic was believed to be at least double the usual levels after many were furloughed or offered redundancy packages.The disclosure comes after ministers slashed the number of destinations on the Government\u0027s red list in one of the biggest reopenings of foreign travel since the start of the pandemic.The  revealed the move last week, before the list was scaled back to just seven destinations on Thursday.But it is understood that senior ministers have discussed concerns that the aviation industry may find itself with insufficient pilots to meet demand as restrictions continue to lift over the coming months, and as airlines seek to introduce summer schedules from next Easter onwards.Martin Chalk, the acting general secretary of the British Airline Pilots\u0027 Association (Balpa), confirmed that the aviation industry also feared a shortage of pilots.One problem was that many have had insufficient time flying commercial planes since the start of the pandemic to keep up with legal requirements and be sufficiently resilient to resume their jobs without retraining.Separately, hundreds are believed to have taken early retirement, with many others switching careers due to a lack of work during the virus crisis. Others have switched to part-time work in what could become a permanent move for many.Mr Chalk said: I have only reached my mid-50s, but I took early retirement last summer because a voluntary redundancy package was being offered.There will be other people who have either been furloughed or made redundant and will have gone back to a previous career or picked up a new career – so an unknown number of us will not fly again.We have a large number of pilots out of work but, as things speed up and airlines seek to recruit, there is a concern that we might go from a position where we had over-supply of pilots to one where actually sufficient have left the profession that we end up with a shortfall. There is a feeling that, next summer, there may be a shortage of pilots.Addressing the number of pilots who will require additional training and flying time before they can transport commercial passengers again, Mr Chalk said: We are calling on the Government to help airlines re-skill and reinvest in resilience so that particularly next spring, as the work ramps up as we hope it will, there are actually the crew there to fly.Balpa is requesting government funding for resilience training for pilots grounded during the pandemic, on the basis that airlines\u0027 finances have already been devastated by the pandemic.Separately, ministers are funding skills bootcamps for people seeing to become HGV drivers amid a shortage of trained workers in the haulage industry.An analysis by consultancy firm Oliver Wyman, drawn up earlier this year, said: The most important question is not whether a pilot shortage will re-emerge, but when it will occur and how large the gap will be between supply and demand.Based on a modest recovery scenario, we believe a global pilot shortage will emerge in certain regions no later than 2023 and most probably before. However, with a more rapid recovery and greater supply shocks, this could be felt as early as late this year.Regarding magnitude, in our most likely scenarios, there is a global gap of 34,000 pilots by 2025. This could be as high as 50,000 in the most extreme scenarios. Eventually, the impact of furloughs, retirements, and defections will create very real challenges for even some of the biggest carriers.More from NewsTreasury plays down hopes of financial support for factories in energy crisisHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing reveals his fireplace explosion injuriesRoyal Family member ‘being realistic’ about skin colour of Sussexes\u0026#39 baby, says John BarnesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british oskar schindler may finally get official recognition","story":"A British spy who saved 10,000 Jews - and collaborated with a Royal - “could finally get recognition he deserves” as Israel’s Holocaust museum changes its evidence policy.Colonel Thomas Joseph Kendrick, a spymaster whose last-ditch operation to secure passports for thousands of Austrian refugees - including, it is believed, Sigmund Freud - is well-documented and has earned him the title “Austria’s Oskar Schindler”.Schindler was a Nazi German industrialist credited with saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them at his enamelware and ammunitions business.However, Col Kendrick has never been recognised as a Righteous Gentile by the Holocaust memorial centre in Jerusalem, Yad Vashem, due to its refusal to accept evidence on potential Righteous Gentiles - a term used for those non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust - from sources other than eyewitnesses.Now Dr Helen Fry, a historian specialising in the Second World War, has revealed that the museum has changed its policy and will accept documentary evidence for the first time, meaning that Col Kendrick - who lived out his retirement in Surrey and died aged 91 in 1972 - could finally receive formal recognition to “cement his legacy”.Dr Fry, who has published a book revealing details of Col Kendrick’s Vienna operation in a new biography, Spymaster, said she has been liaising with Yad Vashem’s Righteous among the Nations Department - and has submitted new written testimonies detailing his actions - calling for “this extraordinary spymaster” who “worked undercover to save a generation of Austrian Jews” to be recognised.“The museum’s new policy is going to be transformative,” she said, adding that it will open the floodgates for other Righteous Gentiles to be remembered. “It means that his legacy, and the legacy of others can be recognised forever. It’s the right thing to do. Those he saved and their relatives want to leave this world knowing that the person who rescued them will be honoured forever.”Among those Col Kendrick helped escape the Nazis include people who became household names in Britain after the war, such as the publisher, Lord George Weidenfeld, pianist Peter Stadlen, lawyer Hans Schick and psychologist and activist Trude Holmes. He is also believed to have helped Sigmund Freud, the Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis, escape the country.Fresh documentary evidence about how Col Kendrick helped 2,000 Jews flee to Rhodesia and Kenya has also been sent to Yad Vashem.However, Dr Fry believes she has also unveiled a royal link to the spy “that can now be placed on record”. She discovered that Countess Marianne Szapary - the mother of HRH Princess Michael of Kent who lived in Czechoslovakia - was actually working on the side of the British for Col Kendrick and MI6.Controversy has surrounded HRH’s Princess Michael’s father, Günther von Reibnitz, who was an SS officer, causing great difficulty for the family.Yet she claims that it can now be revealed - via “a source who cannot be named, but it has been verified as true” - that Princess Michael’s mother was in fact working for MI6 in the 1930s and 1940s.“It is now felt behind the scenes that HRH and her brother and family, and the public, should now know that their mother worked on the side of the British,” Dr Fry said.Col Kendrick was posted to Vienna in 1925 as an SIS station chief and ran a sophisticated spy network across Europe, feeding intelligence back to the Foreign Office under the cover of being the passport control officer at the British Consulate in Vienna.However, in 1938, when the Third Reich annexed Austria, the country’s 200,000 Jews were no longer safe.“Kendrick faced a human catastrophe of immeasurable proportions,” the book says. “Many of his Jewish friends were now at risk. The massive volume of applications from Jews seeking to emigrate was something for which the passport office was ill prepared.In the coming weeks and months he and his staff would be pushed to breaking point. Kendrick embarked on the path of a rescuer becoming the Oskar Schindler of Vienna.”He helped to process up to 175 passport applications a day, and, when that was not enough, he issued fake passports and permits to help Jews flee the country.Eventually, Col Kendrick and his wife were forced to flee Vienna for Britain after being betrayed to the Gestapo by a double agent.The spy never spoke about what he had done after the war.More from NewsChris Packham: Hunt supporters may be responsible for arson attack on my homeTreasury plays down hopes of financial support for factories in energy crisisHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing reveals his fireplace explosion injuriesRoyal Family member ‘being realistic’ about skin colour of Sussexes\u0026#39 baby, says John BarnesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cannot afford overlook energy doorstep","story":"If only we had some gas reserves of our own. Perhaps then we wouldn’t rely quite so heavily on pipelines from Norway and the Netherlands, or on refrigerated ships bringing liquified natural gas from Qatar. Perhaps then millions of households wouldn’t be facing a chilly winter as wholesale gas prices surge, inflating domestic bills by up to 30 per cent. Oh, hang on a minute.Our energy debate has become so fixated on renewables that we have almost forgotten the North Sea, and the vast quantities of untapped shale gas lying below our shores. Not that much will be available to save UK households from soaring bills this winter. As global gas prices spiked to record levels last week, few noticed that the Offshore Petroleum Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning – a Department for Business quango that grants licenses for extraction in the North Sea – rejected an application from Shell to exploit its Jackdaw field, 150 miles off Aberdeen.Shell’s management has expressed surprise, but is it really any wonder? There’s a clue in the quango’s name, which says nothing about promoting energy security - merely scrapping existing infrastructure. At some point Greenpeace snuck into government when we weren’t looking, and our North Sea strategy became ‘leave it in the ground’.That might work, were our renewable sources of energy ready to take over, but they emphatically aren’t. Ministers often chirp that 43 per cent of our electricity generation came from renewables in 2020, more than that generated by fossil fuels. What you are less likely to hear is that renewables accounted for just 13.6 per cent of total energy consumption in 2020 – and two thirds of this came from burning woodchips, biogas and waste, all of which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. By some calculations they are even filthier than coal. Meanwhile wind and solar met less than four per cent of our total energy requirements.We would all love clean energy, but it seems inescapable that however quickly we try to grapple with wind and solar intermittency we will remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels for years to come. And while it is necessary, why don’t we use our own fossil fuels rather than importing them? The North Sea is not as depleted as many believe – it still produces about 40 per cent of our gas. But there is plenty more we could extract if we were prepared to open new fields, many of which, like Jackdaw, could piggyback on existing pipelines and other infrastructure. Then there is shale, which, thanks to a few barely-detectable minor tremors, seems to have lost even the lukewarm support the Cameron government afforded it. Failing to exploit this energy is not ‘environmental’ it simply makes us more dependent on imported fuels and further exposes us to gyrations in global energy markets.Making the most of a bad situation, ministers last week tried to argue that the ongoing energy crisis shows why we must move even more rapidly towards wind and solar - freeing ourselves from overseas dependence. A more reasoned analysis would conclude that we should instead be turning to our own oil and gas.  More from NewsHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing reveals his fireplace explosion injuriesRoyal Family member ‘being realistic’ about skin colour of Sussexes\u0026#39 baby, says John BarnesGovernment could step in to keep factories open as gas prices soar, says Kwasi KwartengMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"should classical liberals abandon hope conservative party","story":"You can call this government a lot of things: tax-grabbing, dirigiste, profligate. What you can’t call it is unconservative. Boris Johnson professes a remarkably conventional Tory creed: patriotic and paternalistic pro-business and pro-spending. His approach would have been immediately recognisable to Disraeli, Baldwin, Churchill, Macmillan or Heath.Margaret Thatcher was and remains the outlier. The idea that loyalty to her memory would one day be regarded as a measure of Tory orthodoxy would have surprised her every bit as much as her One Nation detractors. To the end, she saw herself as, in a sense, an opponent of her own government, a lonely radical struggling to get her reforms past a pessimistic and statist establishment. And she had a point. Her MPs put up with her while she was winning, but turned on her the moment she stumbled.By then, of course, her remedies had been shown to work. Britain, which had had the slowest-growing economy in Western Europe in the 1970s, had the second-fastest in the 1980s (only Spain, coming back from a still lower place, grew faster). Even Labour had to accept that freer competition, lighter regulation and lower taxes made people better off. But neither Labour nor the Tory wets ever really grasped why Thatcherism worked. Their attitude to the lady’s economic legacy was like that of savage tribesmen towards an artefact bequeathed by a higher civilisation – respectful but uncomprehending.Thatcher’s brand of Manchester liberalism never colonised the Conservative Party. At best, it formed a contingent alliance with mainstream Toryism – an unequal alliance, it should be added, for the free-marketeers were always the minority. Thatcher was like a mahout on the back of a massive elephant. The beast was moved by its own instincts – patriotism, religious faith, respect for hierarchy, distaste for indecency, unease about social change. A skilled rider could coax it, whisper in its vast ear, nudge it this way or that. But only up to a point. Thatcher knew better than to jab her goad too harshly. In every year that she was prime minister, for example, there was a net rise in public expenditure – although, overall, the economy grew faster than the government.How did she come to scramble onto the shoulders of that great beast in the first place? After all, conservatism and liberalism had traditionally been the two opposed poles of our party system, mutually repellent down the centuries, whether as the Conservative and Liberal Parties, the Tories and the Whigs or even, in some ways, the Cavaliers and the Roundheads.What pushed them together after three antagonistic centuries was the rise of socialism. Confronted at home with a Labour Party bent on expropriation, and abroad by the Red Army, conservatives and liberals buried their differences. In Western Europe, where there were proportional voting systems, they generally remained in separate and competing parties, though often as coalition partners. But in the Anglosphere, where first-past-the-post encouraged a two-party system, they had to find ways to combine.In the United States, party identities had been as much about regional loyalties as anything else, but a more coherent Right began to take shape in the 1950s. The realignment was driven by William F Buckley, the brilliant, handsome, charismatic editor of the National Review, who believed that constitutionalists, patriots, libertarians, Christians and others must stand together against the Soviet menace. This notion became known as “fusionism” and, though it had its critics (the mighty conservative intellectual Russell Kirk used to argue that he had even less in common with libertarians than he had with socialists), it worked, paving the way for Ronald Reagan’s ascendancy.Something similar happened in Britain at the same time. Ralph Harris, the founder of the Institute of Economic Affairs, told me shortly before he died that he and his fellow free-marketeers had faced a momentous decision after the obliteration of the Liberal Party in the 1950 election. Some had wanted to withdraw from politics, reading papers to each other at the Mont Pelerin Society and preserving the purity of their doctrines, like Irish monks painstakingly copying illuminated manuscripts through the Dark Ages. But Harris was not interested in ideas that could not be implemented. The cheerful pipe-smoker argued that freedom-lovers must seek to capture at least one of the two potential parties of government.The Conservative Party of that era was patrician, imperialist and acquiescent in the creation of Attlee’s state monoliths. So Harris and his colleagues set to work convincing some of its up-and-coming MPs: Enoch Powell, Geoffrey Howe, Nick Ridley and, most consequentially, Keith Joseph, who became Thatcher’s John the Baptist. The British version of fusionism, mixing economic liberalism with cultural conservatism, proved every bit as electorally successful as the American. The Conservatives governed for 18 years.Today, on both sides of the Atlantic, that alliance is fraying. Without the Red Menace to hold it in place, the compound is separating out into its constituent elements – and, as before, the liberals are by far the smaller. The speed with which US Republicans have moved from Reaganism to Trumpery, from laissez-faire to aggressive populism, from free trade to tariffs, is staggering.We classical liberals were few enough before 2020. The median voter was always to our Left on economic issues and to our Right on cultural ones. As is often pointed out, the political centre of gravity in Britain is “fund the NHS, hang the paedos”.The epidemic has made us even more of a minority. Around the world, people are more frightened and therefore more authoritarian. Week after week, as I railed on this page against the severity of the lockdown, I sensed that I was swimming against the current. I now have the same feeling when I argue for private enterprise and lower taxes.Almost all the interventions now being decreed are popular. More money for the NHS and social care, fewer immigrants and higher wages, subsidies to keep us heated through the winter, nationalised railways, taxes on business – all poll well. It is only when their consequences become clear that the mood will turn and even then, it will turn against the government as a whole rather than against the inidual policies that caused the mess.Higher expenditure means slower growth and therefore, in the long term, lower revenues. Higher wages without commensurate increases in productivity mean more inflation. More fuel subsidies mean a worse deficit and a slower recovery. Nationalised railways (have we already forgotten?) mean dirtier and less reliable trains. Taxes on business mean fewer jobs.Even two years ago, I would have felt silly writing that last paragraph. Why repeat such obvious truths? But we have moved, in a stunningly short time, to a media climate in which it is considered good economics to decree higher wages, in the manner of some 1920s Latin American caudillo ordering double salaries for everyone.Do we truly not understand where prices and incomes policies will lead? Some of us are old enough to remember the 1970s, but we seem relaxed about going through it all again – rising inflation, an energy crisis, nationalisations, even Abba. Perhaps we need, as before, to hit rock bottom before we reach for the right remedies.Understandably, in the circumstances, some free-marketeers are wondering whether they should step aside and stop pretending to have anything in common with big government conservatives. Why implicate themselves in a crisis being caused by policies they fundamentally oppose?The answer is that the logic of fusionism has not gone away. In the middle years of the twentieth century, conservatives and liberals were alike menaced by revolutionary socialism today, they are alike menaced by the fanaticism of identity politics.Then, the threat came from Soviet MiGs today it comes from Chinese cyberattacks. In both cases, the Western civilisation that incubated the conservative and liberal traditions is in peril. For classical liberals to give up on the conservative coalition would be fundamentally self-indulgent. It would mean removing the last constraints on government, and ensuring that the debt and inflation crises are needlessly exacerbated. It would mean withdrawing into electoral irrelevance.Perhaps voters are not yet in the mood for liberty. Perhaps we small government types are still at the Keith Joseph rather than the Margaret Thatcher stage. But when we do eventually turn things around, it will be as part of a broad alliance capable of winning and exercising power. We have no right to walk away now.More from NewsTreasury plays down hopes of financial support for factories in energy crisisHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing reveals his fireplace explosion injuriesRoyal Family member ‘being realistic’ about skin colour of Sussexes\u0026#39 baby, says John BarnesMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"universities have moral duty defend dissident academics like","story":"What an almighty relief it was to hear Adam Tickell, the Vice Chancellor of Sussex University on the Today Programme last week, defending his staff members’ “untrammelled right to say and believe what they think”. It is a depressing sign of the times that even this most basic defence of academic freedom feels unusual.Tickell’s intervention may be too little, too late, but it should be a much needed wake-up call to his spineless colleagues. It follows a campaign of intimidation against Professor Kathleen Stock, a lecturer who has published widely on the philosophy of aesthetics, fiction and imagination. Yet it is her views on gender theory that have led horrifically to events which now involve the police. Stickers calling her a “transphobic s---” surfaced in her workplace. An Instagram account called ‘Anti Terf Sussex’ was set up, with the demand “Fire Kathleen Stock. Otherwise you’ll see us around.” Masked protesters lit flares, and flew banners reading “Stock out”. She has endured this kind of harassment for two years at least. Whatever your opinion on the trans debate, does anyone believe that a respected female academic should be treated this way?Stock is just one of many under threat, yet numerous universities have apparently been cowed into silence. It is no coincidence that those targeted most tend to be women with ‘gender-critical’ views - who believe, along with most of the population, that sex is a biological reality. By refusing to kowtow to the idea that gender is simply a feeling that can be changed by self-declaration, they are smeared as “transphobes” and relentlessly bullied.In Stock’s book Material Girls, she reiterates that trans people deserve to be safe and “visible throughout society without shame or stigma”, She makes a point of using students’ “preferred pronouns”, writing “I would never discriminate against any student for any aspect of their identity, including being trans”. (As a lesbian, Stock probably knows a fair bit about discrimination). She sees her role not to convince students of her own beliefs but to encourage open discussion - a view all academics ought to share.Now this very attitude seems under threat. What is shocking about Stock’s case (and cases like it such as Selina Todd at Oxford University and Rosa Freeman at Reading) is their unions’ utter failure to defend them - and their colleagues’ complicity in denouncing them. No wonder Stock told me that lockdown had provided some relief from her overwhelmingly toxic working environment. Who, exactly, is being protected here? If the views of one woman make people in another building feel “unsafe” while that woman is visibly intimidated, then what does ‘safety’ mean?The no-platforming, the disinviting, the sheer animosity towards anyone challenging the dominant narrative - all this is the antithesis to education. The government, recognising the threat, proposed the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Bill. The Left branded it a cynical attempt to promote conservative thought.It is not that simple. Surveys show that students of many political persuasions feel unable to voice their views. The combination of universities seeking to pacify students in a market where they are seen as “consumers” - along with ‘safe spaces’ and other ideas drawn from US campuses, have created an unreal world where no student may be disturbed by a view that bursts their bubble. Legislation is a blunt and unsatisfactory instrument. It is this “no debate” culture and the accompanying self-censorship that must change.Closing down discussion in the name of “inclusion” produces nothing but silence and mediocre intellectual work. Universities have a moral duty to defend academic freedom and dissident thought or we end up with no freedom and no thought at all, held to ransom by unthinking thugs. More from NewsHalloween 2021: trick-or-treating, fancy dress costumes and why we carve pumpkins on October 31Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing reveals his fireplace explosion injuriesRoyal Family member ‘being realistic’ about skin colour of Sussexes\u0026#39 baby, says John BarnesGovernment could step in to keep factories open as gas prices soar, says Kwasi KwartengMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"different crises going uk boris","story":":root Six major crises going on in the UK as Boris Johnson jets off on holidayBoris Johnson is enjoying a Spanish break as Brits face misery from spiralling energy costs, fuel and food shortages, and the Universal Credit cutthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video kwasi-kwarteng-grilled-trevor-phillips-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:aXFmFU,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Prime Minister travelled to Marbella with his we Carrie and their young son Wilf on Friday after attending the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester. He is understood to be staying in a luxury villa on the Costa del Sol until Thursday, where temperatures are a balmy C.But Brits back home are feeling the winter chill as millions face soaring UK energy bills, food and fuel shortages, and the impact of the cut to Universal Credit. A Westminster source told the Sunday Mirror: “It’s fine the PM taking a break, but the timing shows just how out of touch he is with ordinary Brits facing bills, bills and yet more bills.”  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was reasonable for the PM to take a break after a dficult year, where he was hospitalised with Covid- and also lost his mother. He told Times Radio: I believe he has gone away. Iaposm not sure where heaposs gone. But what I would say is I am in regular contact with him. Heaposs also had a year-and-a-half in which heaposs almost lost his le to Covid, his mother passed away very sadly two or three weeks ago and he may have decided to take a short break. I think thataposs something reasonable. Iaposm in regular WhatsApp contact with him, I spoke to him only a few days ago. Iaposm not sure when heaposs supposed to have left the country. Here are some of the issues piling up in the PMaposs in-tray while he enjoys a break. Energy costs rising and suppliers at risk of collapse Brits are facing higher energy costs this winter as soaring global gas supplies have forced smaller suppliers out of business. Gas prices have soared by % in the last  months, according to Ovo chief executive Stephen Fitzpatrick. The surge has been blamed on a number of factors, including a cold winter last year, high demand from Asia and a reduction in supplies from Russia.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng insisted that the energy price cap - which protects consumers from sudden hikes in their bills - will remain in place this winter. Suppliers are struggling to stay afloat, with trade body Energy UK warning more could go bust in the coming months. Dermot Nolan, former chief executive of Ofgem, said it was likely that many energy firms will start going out of business. But he assured customers they would be switched to another supplier. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley warned this week that Brits should expect a signicant hike in energy costs in April when the cap on household bills is reviewed. Business Secretary canapost rule out energy outages this winter Mr Kwarteng was unable to guarantee there will be no interruptions to gas supply this winter but insisted he was as certain as I could be it would continue. He told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips On Sunday: Iaposm very committed and convinced that we will have full energy supply. Iaposm as certain as I could be. Because obviously this is a global issue, weaposve seen right across the world real supply chain pressures, youaposve seen the Chinese have power blackouts, theyaposre rationing supply, here in the UK our job is to make sure there is minimal disruption.  Mr Kwarteng said it wasnapost his job to advise people to wrap up warmer when askedBrits should put on another woolly jumper. Itaposs up to people - itaposs amazing how dferent peopleaposs cold thresholds can be very dferent, he said. Some people feel comfortable wrapped up in lots of dferent clothes, others wear relatively little - I think people should be sensible. I think people should do what they feel comfortable with.Factories aposdaysapos from shutdown over gas pricesIndustry leaders have warned that factories are just “days away” from having to stop production due to the escalating energy costs. David Dalton, of the British Glass Manufacturers’ Association, said some companies were “days” from having to close temporarily, according to the Sunday Times.Mr Kwarteng dashed hopes from struggling manufacturers and energy firms of more support but said he is working closely with Chancellor Rishi Sunak to help industry.However, a senior Treasury source insisted that no such talks have taken place. The Government was forced to step in when US fertiliser giant CF Industries temporarily stopped production in its British plants last month due to the hike in gas prices. The firm produces carbon dioxide as a by-product - triggering shortages of CO which is widely used in the food sector to keep products fresh.  Universal Credit cuts begin to bite - as peers aim to force showdown Millions of people are being hit by cuts to Universal Credit as the Tories refused to drop their plans to ditch the £-a-week increase. The temporary uplt was introduced at the start of the pandemic, amounting to around £,-a-year. Tory peer Baroness Stroud has vowed to stage a vote in the Lords over the cruel cut. She recently told the BBC: At this moment in time, MPs have not voted on this at all, itaposs been a decision taken by the Executive, so my intention is to bring a vote in the Lords, cross-party vote that would say to the House of Commons, ‘Think again on this issue. Is this something we really want to do as a civilised nation, putting our poorest people into poverty is surely not the way forward as we come out of the pandemic ’ Shoppers face empty shelves and told to aposget used to higher food pricesapos One in six adults in Britain have been unable to buy essential food items in the last fortnight, according to the Office for National Statistics . Some % of adults said they had not been able to purchase vital goods as they were not available, while % said the same for non-essential food items. Downing Street has drafted in former Tesco boss Sir Dave Lewis to solve the supply chain crisis. He will identy current blockages and pre-empting potential future issues. Miguel Patricio, boss of Kraft Heinz which makes baked beans and ketchup, said inflation and the lack of truck drivers in the UK was driving up prices. We are raising prices, where necessary, around the world, he told the BBC. Army drafted in to drive fuel tankers Motorists have struggled to get fuel in recent weeks due to shortages of drivers to get petrol to the pumps. Army tanker drivers have had to be deployed to help fill petrol stations hit by fuel shortages. Ministers have insisted there is no dearth of fuel but acute driver shortages created widespread issues.  The Government is expanding a fast-track scheme to train up to , HGV drivers to ease the crisis. But the , additional places on -week courses will not begin until next month, meaning it is unlikely to solve issues this Christmas.

Advice for a further  locations, including Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand, will also be eased. The move will make it easier for Britons to obtain travel insurance to visit the destinations.  Most policies are invalidthe Government has advised against all but essential travel to a country. It follows the removal of travel advisories to  countries earlier this week and is part of a new policy to stop advising Britons to avoid all but essential travel to non-red list countries on Covid- grounds except in exceptional circumstances, such aslocal health systems are overwhelmed. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: These updates make travel abroad easier - boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families. I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe.” In a further boost to the beleaguered travel and aviation industries, which have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, an overhaul to rules around coronavirus tests travellers have to take when ing to the UK from abroad will be in place by the end of the month. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the deadline, which was announced when a previous overhaul of the travel regime aa unveiled, and said he wanted cheaper lateral flow devices to replace expensive polymerase chain reactiontests by half-term. The Cabinet Minister claimed travellers ing to the UK could be done and dusted with organising testing before they even get home, with lateral flow tests available at airports. He vowed the switch from PCR testing to lateral flows would be ready for families to have a foreign holiday this month. Askedhe was referring to English schoolsapos half-term breaks, he told Times Radio: Yes, thataposs right, October . “Thataposs the goal, and, as I say, the testing companies are gearing up to do that. “Iaposve spoken to the airports including Heathrow and they even have tests available as you walk through the airport, so you could be done and dusted before you even get home with these things, which will be a massive improvement to having to send off PCR tests to labs and waiting for the results and all the costs involved. It is understood the lateral flow tests would not be free but would be a far cheaper alternative to PCR tests, where costs have sometimes reached hundreds of pounds.

The Government said it was only a temporary measure, because you can’t expect the poor to eat permanently. Minister Nadine Dorries helpfully explained: “What we’re doing is giving people a step out.” It’s always a sign of generosity, to help the poor step out by taking money off them. That’s why you see so many people lying in shop doorways, shouting “can you take a few coins off me please, mate. I’ve got nearly two quid to last me the week, please take it away so I can step out”. It’s the same when a crackhead robs  quid from a pensioner. The robbers are simply helping them not to rely on their pension, and to step out to towards self-reliance by having to eat cat food for the week.  The cut seems especially generous because the other financial news is that the wealthiest people in the world are hiding £.trillion in tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, where they dodge the rules to avoid paying tax. So there’s an obvious way to make the world fair. The poorest people in Britain must be allowed to set up a benefits haven. Anyone should be allowed to claim as many benefits as they like, as long as all the money is sent to the Isle of Wight, where the rules are relaxed. So you can receive unemployment benefit while doing a window cleaning round, as long as the windows are registered in Ventnor.  Cleaners will be able to claim Universal Credit without mentioning their earnings on the application,their bucket and sponges have a residence in a cupboard on the ferry from Portsmouth. Campaigners will protest against this obvious theft, but the Government can say they can’t be too hard on benefit cheats or they’ll move abroad and fiddle a dferent country, which will be a huge loss to our economy. You’ll be able to claim disability benefit, saying that you can’t move because your neck is broken in  places eventhere’s nothing wrong with it, as long as the neck is registered on Shanklin pier. Specialist accountants will find loopholes in the law that state this is perfectly legal providing the neck is in the Isle of Wight for  days a year. So claimants will have to visit each year, and the island will be transformed into a giant playground for benefit cheats. A massive harbour will be built in Sandown, where benefit cheats will spend their summer relaxing on the decks of their pedalos and sipping lager before flaunting their wealth in the amusement arcades. Sometimes it will be reported that a woman from St Helens has claimed for  babies that don’t exist, but her financial advisor will reply that they were all registered as living in the theme park at Blackgang Chine, so no law has been broken. She’ll donate £million to a party that supports benefit cheats, and the world will be fair at last.

This is a shame, because this time it’s about comedy and Manchester, and I wanted to start with a Ken Goodwin gag. It’s a great joke – about a horse that collapses in Piccadilly – but I listen to feedback and jokes from the s are strictly off-limits from now on. It is a shame. I don’t knowyou remember Mr Goodwin, who died in , but he was a staple on The Comedians back in the day. Famous for his nervous, stuttering style, but a really good, gentle comedian. “It’s all in the character, the way I tell the jokes,” he once said, “I’m just Simple Simon. I come over all nervous and shy, and most of the audience is laughing at me before I’ve said a word.” Which is ideal for a comedy turn – but not what you look for in a Prime Minister.  I don’t knowyou watched Mr Johnson last week as he took to the stage in Manchester to deliver his ­set-piece conference performance. Probably you didn’t. I, once again, had to. There were, to be fair to whoever wrote it, some decent jokes. More than some, in fact. They kept coming. At that point the horror of it dawned on me – this speech was all jokes. No policy, no reference to social care, no mention of the brutal universal credit cut his Government had just enacted. Just a -minute act that could have been done at a golf club, or a corporate retreat, or the wedding of someone you don’t like. Meantime, a day later and a couple of miles across town, the current Leader of the Opposition, Marcus Rashford, gave a speech of his own as he proudly received an honorary degree from Manchester Uni.  He said: “Yesterday, millions of families across the UK lost a leline and a means of staying afloat – a move that could see child poverty rise to one in three children. For that reason, today is bittersweet.” There’s not really any competition any more, is there  The nature of this PM is beginning to come to the fore. He was never built for crisis. He is a good-time type of guy, and this has not been a good time. It’s going to get tougher, too. It’s not one of those things you can laugh your way through. Whether it dawns on the wider ­country or not, I’m not sure. He is still odds-on to win the next election but those odds are getting longer with every empty shelf, every Covid death, every cancelled rail project, every flash of Russian money. Christmas, let me tell you, had better be good. Otherwise, Mr Johnson is going to have to rely on this increasingly tired act to get him through. The misconception is that he’s the type of guy you’d like to have a pint with. Let me tell you: he’s not. To be fair to him, very few politicians are the type of guy you would like to have a pint with. Ken Goodwin, on the other hand, would have been a joy: “I got on the bus in Manchester the other day and I said to the conductor, ‘Do you stop at the Imperial ’ He said, ‘What – on my money ’” Beautul. Last mention of Ken, I promise. But they don’t write them like that any more.

Ms Skinner told the Sun : I did the school run with the baby this week and someone came over to me and askedshe was mine.“I had to explain that she’s my grand-daughter and they were quite shocked. Everyone has assumed she is Maizie’s younger sister so we have to keep explaining that she’s actually her daughter. “People mistake me for her mum all the time. “When Maizie was in hospital, the nurse who came to give her an epidural askedwe were sisters. We can laugh about it because it happens all the time. I’m used to it now.”Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror  Ms Skinner said that she was initially worried when she found out her oldest daughter was pregnant, remembering how dficult it was for her to become a mum at such young age. My first reaction was worry because it wasn’t easy for me when I found out that I was pregnant so young, she continued. “But I wouldn’t change anything for the world and I love our little family. Maizie has taken to being a mum so naturally and I’m so proud of her.” Maizie went into labour last Saturday and, after a dficult birth, the baby was born weighing lb oz at .am on Sunday.  Ms Skinner said that Maizie had to be induced and had an epidural that didnapost work work one side.

Ms Skinner said it had been really good so far as they are a close-knit family, adding that it was lovely for the baby to have so many people around to support her. She added that her two daughters are loving being aunties and had been very sweet with their new niece. However, Ms Skinner said her own mother was not ready to be called a great-grandmother when she is in her s. Maizie said she was scared to tell her mum she was pregnant, but had received overwhelming support. “She just hugged me and told me it would be OK and supported me from then, she continued. I don’t know where I would be without her. “She’s teaching me everything I need to know and more and I’m so grateful for her.

Asked how worried the public should be about flu this winter, she told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips On Sunday: We should be worried about flu each winter. I think people still donapost realise it can be a fatal disease. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Recent studies suggest that about % of us donapost actually understand that. On average, over the last five years, about , people have died with flu-related conditions. This year will be the first time flu in any real numbers and Covid will be around at the same time, she said. She added: So the risks of catching both together still remain. Andyou do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together, than just having Covid alone. So I think itaposs an uncertain winter ahead - thataposs not a prediction, itaposs an uncertain feature - but we do know that flu cases have been lower in the previous year so immunity and the strain types are a little more uncertain.  Explaining that this yearaposs flu could be made up of dferent strains, she said the vaccine being offered this winter season is to protect against four of those. She said: Weaposve got a pretty good array in our toolbox to try and hit whichever one becomes dominant but it could be more than one this year, and peopleaposs immunity will be lower. So I think the real trick here is to get vaccinated - in both Covid and flu - but obviously to continue to do those good hygiene behaviours that weaposve been practising all through Covid. The average flu season sees around , deaths a year.  Dr Harries insisted it is not the case that  deaths a day is seen as an acceptable death rate for Covid, and said officials are still taking it extremely seriously. She told The Andrew Marr show: We are starting to move to a situation where, perhaps Covid is not the most signicant element and many of those iniduals affected will of course have other comorbidities which will make them vulnerable to serious illness for other reasons as well. She said the extremely good vaccine uptake is now preventing very signicant amounts of hospitalisation and death, but added that this is now one of the most dficult times to predict what will come with coronavirus. She said: We have dferent levels of vaccination, we have a little bit of immunity waning in older iniduals, which is why weaposre now starting to put in a Covid booster vaccine. We have slightly dferent effectiveness in dferent vaccinations that have been provided. On a positive note, she said it appears the global dominance of the Delta iant has seen other coronavirus iants become extinct, but she added that we still need to stay alert because it is still very early days of a new virus.

To celebrate the launch of Zinger Popcorn Bucket - available for a limited time only - we decided to champion people who like to spice things up, including Hannah Murphy, . When she reached a career crossroads in , Hannah struck out on a new adventurous course, and almost a decade on has no regrets about her bold decision. When I was made redundant from my eight-year career as a flight attendant, flying both domestically and between the UK and Japan, I saw it as an opportunity set myself a new challenge, and have new adventures, says Hannah who lives in Southampton with her husband and three children, Angelina, , Archie,  and Adriana, five. At the time I was a single mum of one after my previous relationship ended, and the ‘sensible’ decision would have been to take a - desk job, something stable but didnapost challenge me. That’s just not me though, I have to love what I do and find joy in it every day. Instead, Hannah trained as a fitness instructor and began to incorporate a hula hoop into her training. It wasn’t just a useful exercise tool, great for toning and core strength, it was so much fun. The moment I started hula hooping, I was transported back to my childhood, it was really liberating. As word got out about Hannah’s hula hooping prowess, friends and family began to ask for lessons, followed by requests from local schools for Hannah to come in and teach children how to hula hoop.  It snowballed and before I knew it, I had so much interest in hula hooping fitness classes, I had to train other instructors to help me. I went on to create a training programme called Globe Fit and today I have teachers all around the world, from Australia to America, all teaching my programme. I love teaching hula hooping, particularly adults, because they might start off a bit self-conscious and inhibited but soon their inner child is released and they just go for it! I’ve taught people aged from teenagers to eighty-year-olds. Last year, I hosted the first ever world hula hooping championship, which will be taking place again later this year. After launching the UKaposs first hula hooping championship in , which took place in Fareham, Hampshire, Hannah decided to go global in . Not even a pandemic could stop her with the event going virtual and around twenty-five competitors, women and men of all ages and abilities, taking part from as far afield as India, America and Australia. I had a  of four judges, including John Parnell aka Hoop Guy who appeared on Britainaposs Got Talent in . Competitors submitted videos of themselves performing with their hoop, and were marked on everything from skill to tricks they could do, with the  judging the videos.  The second world championship will take place in December this year, again virtually, and I hope to have even more people taking part. It’s amazing to be a part of people experiencing something new and fun, it doesn’t feel like work!

Industry insiders claim , new recruits are now needed to keep bus fleets moving, The Sun reports.The knock-on effect for bus companies is palpable as drivers currently earning an average of £, a year are being lured by the prospect of up to £, as truckers. The Confederation of Public Transport said: It is having an impact across the country. More bus drivers are quitting than we can recruit and talk of higher-paid jobs in road haulage is adding to the problem. Some have unquestionably been attracted to lorry driving by all this talk about wages increasing.  Several bus companies have reduced ­the frequency of services to try to avoid cancelling buses on school runs or crucial commuting routes, with the hardest-hit areas in Scotland, the north-east of England, Bristol and south Gloucestershire. However, there are shortages across the entire country - West Yorkshire is short of about  drivers, or % of the required number, according to the regionaposs transport bosses. If we increased wages it would mean higher fares for passengers, the CPT added. We don’t have the flexibility of the road haulage industry, which is part of a long delivery chain where the cost can be spread.  Meanwhile, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi has expanded the Skills Bootcamp to provide up to , HGV driving courses, which amounts to around , more than originally planned. He said: HGV drivers are vital to keeping this country moving. To help more people into the industry, we’re expanding our Skills Bootcamps to offer to support , people to gain the skills they need to be road ready. We will also help those with previous experience refresh their skill-set so they can get back on the road.

Few would have appreciated the anguish and suffering she had endured growing up and how she nearly died from anorexia as a teenager. Now the bridal design company owner is helping others fight potentially deadly eating disorders. At age , April spent a week in hospital after her weight plunged to three-and-a-half stone. She traces her weight problems to when she was eight. Her parents orced and she felt rejected. April would throw her lunch into the bushes on the way to school and only nibble on crackers. At meal times she would sit staring at her plate for hours, until dad Ian, an Olympic cyclist who won a  bronze in Montreal, would lose his patience and send her to bed. She finally overcame her issues when she was . She won Ms Great Britain , a contest for women aged  and over. April, , who is ft in, now weighs a healthy eight-and-a-half stone and visits schools as an ambassador for eating disorder charity SEEDto talk to young people about their problems and mental health issues. “At my lowest point I weighed three-and-a-half stone,” said April, who was raised by Ian and her nan Dorothy. “There’s a picture of me on a bicycle and I look so gaunt, I was in the worst place possible. Dad took that picture to show how bad it was. “It was very distressing for Dad and Nan. I ended up in hospital for over a week, I ­nearly died. That was the wake-up call I needed.” Dorothy inspired her recovery but it still took April several years to start eating properly. She said: “Nan sat me down and made me watch a film about a young girl with ­anorexia who died. “Nan said she didn’t want that to be me. After hospital I still found it % dficult to eat, it took me years to eat.  “I was about , it was a long slow process. Anorexia is a mental disorder, a mind over matter thing. You have to train the mind to no longer play tricks and that food is no longer the enemy. “I’ve had counselling. I had so much therapy well into early adult le, Dad made sure I spoke to the therapist and had regular weight check-ins. “Even on the road to recovery my body mass index was at a point of looking anorexic. I was eating and eating and not gaining weight, I was trying to recover. My family knew I was but I had a ­naturally fast metabolism. “My family made my meals, everything was monitored. My absolute favourite now is a Sunday dinner, I love it, beef or chicken.”  A record number of children and young people with a potentially le-threatening eating disorder are waiting for treatment in England. In April to June,  patients were on stand by for urgent treatment, up from  at the same time last year. A further , patients were waiting for routine treatment, up from  a year earlier. April, who appeared on Channel ’s The Bachelor and ITV’s The Cabins, has found it is not just children who are fixated with how they look. She said: “In my day job as a bridal designer, I see so many beautul women who are always ­talking about losing weight and looking perfect and it absolutely breaks my heart.” She posted videos online during lockdown to reach out to those who are struggling. April has had many positive messages since and, after lockdown, was approached by a woman in public, who told her: “You don’t realise the good you’ve done.”The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All. We’re calling for:Early Access Mental Health Hubs for under s to be rolled out across the country, with at least one for each trust.

It meant everything. For me to be able to help others who may not have recovered was the icing on the cake.” SEED chief exec Shelley Perry said of April: “SEED Lancashire and Breathe have thoroughly enjoyed working with someone that has such a passion for helping and supporting anyone suffering with mental health and eating disorders. “She’s a fantastic public figure that highlights the journey through recovery and helps to guide anyone needing support into the right place. We are grateful for the work that we do together.”  Jenny Cairns, SEED ­marketing and ­communication volunteer, added: “April has a good heart and a willingness to help other people. “She has such a passion for helping people. This is something she’s been wanting to do for a while, she has always had a drive for that.

Colette Cheape has urged parents to be on the look out after watching her brave son Odhrán go through  weeks of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries in just under four years. He was just a few months old when aposmilky brown birth marksapos started appearing across his body in late . After being taken to get them checked out, he was diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis type  . This is a genetic condition that, in serious cases, causes a range of conditions including tumours, body deformities, blindness and learning dficulties. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter Worried parents, Colette,  and Richard, , were told his case was at that stage still mild, meaning his condition was stable for the time being but had to be closely monitored. But in April , Odhrán started struggling with bowel movements and extreme tiredness It prompted an MRI scan at Glasgowaposs Royal Hospital for Children. Doctors then told Richard and Colette, from Kilsyth, the aposworst news imaginableapos. Odhrán had a brain tumour as a result of NF and to stand any chance of survival he urgently needed risky surgery to drain fluid the next day.Colette, whoaposs also mum to Aoe, , and one-year-old Una, told the Daily Record : When we were told the NF had resulted in a brain tumour our world fell apart.We were in lockdown where only Richard could stay in hospital with Odhrán, I felt so helpless. Doctors said he was, at that point, critically ill. It was so tough. For the next year and a half the family watched little Odhran fight off the condition. His second surgery to aposdebulkapos the large tumour on the brain, one week after the drainage op, was incredibly daunting in itself. Colette added: There was a chance heaposd not survive, come out blind or brain damaged, it was terrying. But we had no other option.  The procedure successfully removed % of the tumour and after a month-long recovery, where the toddler learned to walk again, Odhrán was reunited with his sisters at home. But in late May  medics discovered his tumour aposwasnapost behavingapos and put him on a -week course of chemotherapy, to eliminate the risk of it ever posing a danger again. On September  this year, one day before his fourth birthday, Odhrán finished chemotherapy for good. The family hosted a garden party to mark the special occasion where, surrounded by family and friends, the beaming youngster rang the bell to official mark the end of his treatment. To say thank you to hospital staff, gran Marie Brady launched an GoFundMe page, which has so far raised over £,. Colette also created a public Instagram account to document Odhránaposs recovery journey and raise awareness about aposcoffee spotsapos, formally known as Cafe Au Lait marks, and the condition NF. According to the Childhood Tumour Trust Neurofibromatosis Type is more prevalent than Cystic Fibrosis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and Huntingtons Disease combined. Almost all NF patientswill have six or more Cafe Au Lait marks on their skin. She said: We are so grateful to the childrenaposs hospital, we donapost know where weaposd be without them. Odhrán loving weekly hospital chemo visits is testament to them. With the Instragram, I wanted to get the word out there. NF is more common that Cystic Fibrosis yet not that many people know about it. “We hope we can help to raise awareness of the signs of NF in order to help children receive early diagnosis and therefore the necessary specialist care.”For more information on Neurofibromatosis visit the NHS website or the Childhood Tumour TrustYou can donate to the familyaposs Childrenaposs Hospital fundraiser through their official JustGiving page.Comment MORE ON NHSChildrens HospitalHospitalsBrain Tumours\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A meeting was held last January where Charles, Anne and Edward were in agreement that their brother should never be allowed toto public le, an insider has claimed. The source said: “Nine months ago Charles, Anne and Edward had a meeting, a summit, and agreed there was no way back for him.” It comes as the scandal hit Duke of York is also deemed to be a threat for the Royal Family by William who allegedly thinks he is “ungracious and ungrateful,” said a Sunday Times source. Andrew, , is facing a sex abuse lawsuit in the United States and stepped back from public le after a disastrous interview for him on the BBC’s Newsnight nearly two years ago.  The bad publicity that the saga has given the royals means that he will never be allowed back it is claimed by the Sunday Times insider. They said: “There is no way in the world he’s ever coming back, the family will never let it happen.” The source also claimed that William is annoyed about Andrew’s attitude since the scandal has emerged, saying it’s what “really gets” to him. They continued: “Any suggestion there isn’t gratitude for the institution, anything that could lead the public to think that senior members of the family aren’t grateful for their position,is really dangerous.”While Andrew’s image has been tarnished, it does appear that he feels he can put the scandal behind him especially with the way he took a leading role at the funeral of Prince Philip this year in speaking to the media. He talked to television crews outside All Saints Chapel, Windsor Lodge, two days after the Duke of Edinburgh died to express the feelings of the Royal Family. A friend of Charles told The Sunday Times that Andrew seized the opportunity “to be in front of a camera and was making it clear to the households that he was going to be in front of a camera ASAP.” But a Sunday Times source said that while Charles “loves” his brother he feels that the sex abuse writ served by his accuser Virginia Giuffre is causing “unwelcome reputational damage to the institution”. Adding: “a way back for the Duke is not possible, because the spectre of this accusation raises its head with hideous regularity”. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. Kensington Palace was contacted for comment.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkPrince WilliamRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Guthy has supported Democrat causes too, but backing Crumpacker seems hugely at odds with the royals’ views. The tycoon is also a gas-guzzling driver who let eco-warriors Harry and Meghan fly on his company’s private jet.  That trip, last month, came after a string of public engagements in New York by the couple, who say they are on a mission to “build a better world”.Since stepping down as senior royals they have launched the charity foundation Archewell – while also netting lucrative deals with the likes of Netflix and Spoty.A source told the Sunday Mirror: “Harry and Meghan have become regular visitors to Bill Guthy’s estate in Carpinteria. Bill is one of le’s winners. “He certainly knows all about how to make a buck. Guthy has made donations to Democrat campaigns for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, but his backing of The Trumpbacker seems to point to a vastly dferent view to that of Harry and Meghan. “It appears the main thing the three of them have in common is a talent for making big money deals.”  Guthy lives on a vast estate in Carpinteria, north of Los Angeles and  miles from the home of Harry, , Meghan, , and their children Archie, two, and baby Lilibet. He also has a £million pad in Beverly Hills, with tennis court and pool. Aged , he drives a mpg Cadillac Escalade ESV. That, plus his support of Crumpacker, may spark interesting chats with the royals. Records show that he donated , in  to the Oregon Republican’s failed bid to be elected to Congress. Crumpacker vowed to protect gun rights and the unborn and to “stand with Trump, get the economy moving and build the wall”.

Guthy’s earlier Republican donations included , to the  Bush Cheney campaign. Meghan spoke out against Trump in a TV interview in . She said: “Trump is isive, think about female voters alone. In  the Republican Party lost the female vote by  points and with as mis-ogynistic as Trump is, and so vocal about it, that’s a huge chunk of it.” Harry, meanwhile, told a prank caller who impersonated Greta Thunberg: “The mere fact Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry so big, he has blood on his hands. The effect that has on the climate. Trump will want to meet you to make him look better, but he won’t want a discussion about climate change because you will outsmart him.” Guthy and business partner Greg Renker launch-ed their firm in  after being inspired by Think and Grow Rich, written by Napoleon Hill in . The pals used savings to promote the guide via TV infomercials. Sales of the book, and a tape of Hill’s lectures, netted nearly million.  One of the best-selling self-help books of all time, it urges readers to believe anything is possible, telling wannabe millionaires to write down their aims on a piece of paper and read them back to themselves morning and night. Guthy-Renker has gone on to work with the likes of Heidi Klum, Jessica Simpson, Cindy Crawford, Jenner Lopez and Kelly Clarkson.

Prince William and his brother Harry appeared to be on good terms as they unveiled the statue, with the pair smiling and chatting throughout the day.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletterAt the unveiling of the statue in July, the brothers were understood to have come to “an unspoken agreement” to put their feud behind them and make the day about their late mother.The Duke of Cambridge is expected to attend the party for the sponsors of the statue on October . It was previously reported that royal aides were preparing for Meghan and Harry to make a surprisefor the bash. But a spokeswoman for the couple has now confirmed they will not be ing for the party. It comes after the Sussexes moved to Calornia, with Harry working on a memoir due to be published late next year. In the book, Harry will share his adventures, losses, and le lessons, publisher Penguin Random House said. In his statement, Harry said he is writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man Iaposve become”. He said: “I’ve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story — the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned — I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I’ve learned over the course of my le so far and excited for people to read a first hand account of my le that’s accurate and wholly truthful.” The book may go into detail about his relationship with older brother, which is believed to have been strained over the past few years. The feud was reportedly sparked by Williamaposs concerns over Harryaposs fast-developing relationship with Meghan Markle.From the moment Meghan came into Harryaposs le, tensions flared between Harry and William, according to last summer’s biography Finding Freedom.

Cristian Pompa had been weaving in and out of traffic in a red BMW on the M near junction  on Thursday March  last year.The -year-old struck a car from behind, sending the vehicle and the woman inside crashing into the central reservation, reports Leicester Mercury. The smash wrote off her vehicle and caused her soft tissue injuries which required physiotherapy treatment. The boyaposs car then crashed into the front offside of a Volvo heavy goods vehicle.  David Earl, prosecuting, said: The impact wrenched the steering wheel from the lorry driveraposs hands as the steering jammed. The vehicle left the carriageway, went down a bank and tipped onto its side. The driver was trapped in his cab and had to be cut out by the fire service. The HGV was damaged beyond repair.. The prosecutor said: The lorry driveraposs injuries included three fractures to his spine, a broken right scapula and soft tissue damage to his shoulder and back. The pain was excruciating.He was off work for  weeks and has ongoing issues, including severe headaches and is still on painkillers.In a victim impact statement he said he suffers flashbacks and anxiety. Pompa, who has since turned , fled from the carnage but was arrested after his DNA was found on the blown airbag of his abandoned car. He pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court to causing serious injury by dangerous driving, Mr Earl said the lorry driver was also a carer for his we, who suffers from MS, and his injuries made it particularly dficult to look after her. She was traumatised by the incident and seeing him in hospital. The court heard that when arrested, Pompa, of Park Avenue, Tottenham, London - who has  non-dwelling burglaries and four thefts on his criminal record - gave a no comment interview and has never identied the driver of the red BMW who whisked him away from the crash scene.  Sentencing, Judge Robert Brown said: You were  years old and had no driving licence and should not have been behind the wheel of a car or driving down the M motorway. Your driving was appalling and whilst attempting a manoeuvre, squeezing between two vehicles, you caused a serious collision. The lorry driver was trapped and had to be rescued by others at the scene, who turned off his engine because he was unable to. There are ongoing consequences for him. Your vehicle stopped but instead of going back to see how the other drivers were you got into a car that had been following you and sped off. Fleeing the scene was utterly shameful. Iaposm told youaposre now remorseful. Priya Bakshi, mitigating, said Pompaaposs family were in court and his parents appreciated how serious the offence was. At the time Pompa was studying for his GCSEs and was hoping to do a mechanics college course having passed his exams. Miss Bakshi said Pompa was sorry and had since matured, now recognising the error of his ways. She added: Thereaposs nothing I can say to excuse what he did. He sayaposs aposIaposm guilty and I was , to say sorry is not enough andI could turn the clock back in time I would, I didnapost think of the consequences.aposI know I could have killed others and killed myself.aposPompa was sentenced to  months detention.

That alarm will go offsomeone’s not breathing. And during the Covid pandemic it felt like it was going off constantly. Being an ambulance dispatcher is already a stressful job, when every day you see and hear things that most people don’t see in their letimes. But during Covid, especially during the second and third waves, the call volume went through the roof. It was the worst thing I’ve seen in my le. Every call seemed to be either someone dying of Covid, or suffering with their mental health because of the pandemic. It was like that on repeat, and that takes its toll on you.Have you struggled with your mental health in lockdown  Email webnews@mirror to tell your story There were so many people who were dying, in their homes, at the supermarket. I’d sometimes spend two to four hours talking to a suicidal caller. A couple of people have even taken their own le while on the phone. I was shocked at how many calls I was taking from elderly people who were struggling. Normally they are the strong ones, the ones who always impressed me by just battling on, yet now they were having real problems with their mental health because they’d spent so much time on their own. I would think, ‘God, you remind me of my Nan, or my Grandad’. It was a really scary time.  When someone stops breathing we always send three resources - a manager, a paramedic and an ambulance - so there are enough people to save their le. But resources were started to get really stretched. I remember on one sht when I was dispatching during the second lockdown when so many people weren’t breathing that for the first time in my career I didn’t know what to do. It felt like all of our crews were already busy with other patients.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All. We’re calling for:Early Access Mental Health Hubs for under s to be rolled out across the country, with at least one for each trust. Waiting times to be cut so people actually start treatment with a professional within four weeks The Govt to fill in the gaps in care - an end of red tape which means many don’t fit the set criteria to get help plus , more mental health staffCompulsory Mental Health education lessons in schools, plus paid counsellors in schools and care homesWant to help  Write to your MP and ask them to support the current Early Day Motion  to debate mental health and the pandemic in parliament. In  my best friend, also an emergency dispatcher, took his own le. I took it badly, and my employers paid for therapy, which carried on into the pandemic and which helped me cope during the first wave. But those sessions were now over. When you’re spending so much time dealing with suicides and deaths, you become negative. I began to feel so low and unable to cope, like I was in a bottomless pit I couldn’t get out of. I started having anxiety attacks before going to work, and was vomiting before and after every sht. I worried constantlyI would have enough ambulances and crews, and about my staff too, who were terried. I felt like the worst person when I had to send them to a Covid patient as we weren’t quite sure what we were sending them to. Access the Mirror’s mental health resource hubIt got so bad that every time the emergency alarm went off I would jump, the noise was causing me so much anxiety. I was even hearing it in my head when I went home. After every sht I would call my friend and just start crying, even though I didn’t know exactly why I was crying. I started taking antidepressants but although they helped me sleep they just made me feel numb. I asked for more therapy sessions but I was declined because there were so many other staff on the waiting list for mental health support. I’m grateful for the therapy I did get though, the weekly phone calls with a psychologist made me a stronger person and I don’t know where I’d be without them.  It’s scary how many of my colleagues are dealing with mental health issues. They are some of the strongest people I’ve ever met, and many are messaging me to tell me they are struggling too. Mental health support in the emergency services has to be the best of the best, becauseyou can’t look after yourself how can you look after others  At the moment blue light staff generally receive six to  one-hour sessions of therapy, but in some cases that isn’t enough. I firmly believe we need more funding for mental health support at every level, but especially in the emergency services where we deal with le and death situations every day.How to get help: If you are struggling or you are worried about a loved one, contact Samaritans on .

In the latest warning for nature, the UK has recorded its lowest ever number in an annual survey of the insects.And the future looks even bleaker after ­scientists warned the decline could accelerate due to more extreme weather linked to climate change.Butterfly Conservation, which counted butterflies and moths between July  and August , said the results marked the lowest numbers since the Big Butterfly Count started years ago and called for urgent action. As well as being a vital part of the food chain, butterflies are signicant indicators of the health of the environment. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter The number of peacock butterflies fell by % compared with last year, while the common blue declined by %, speckled wood by % and small tortoiseshell by %. On average, nine butterflies or moths were spotted per -minute count by , volunteers, down from  in , and  in . A handful of species, including marbled white and ringlet, rose from low levels during last year’s count. Butterfly Conservation said heavy downpours in May, when England had the highest rainfall for that month since , hampered breeding and feeding.  “Butterflies don’t like rain at all, they’re coldblooded. Effectively they’re solar-powered,” the charity said. “With more climate ­change-related extreme weather likely, the impact on some of the UK’s most loved insects could be devastating.” The State of the UK’s Butterflies report, a scientic survey last published in , found three quarters of Britain’s ­butterflies had declined since . The large blue is an exception, with numbers growing since it was reintroduced in  via caterpillars from Sweden. Julie Williams, the charity’s chief ­executive, said: “The facts are clear.

Itaposs so important to give something back infor the trust placed in me. But no training could have prepared me for what I experienced during the Covid pandemic. Whether I was treating patients, or serving my constituents in Parliament, my view of le changed fundamentally.We all know the awful toll of statistics: , dead, , hospitalised, over two million estimated to be suffering from the devastating effects of long Covid. But less is known about a serious side-effect of the crisis - its impact on peopleaposs mental health. Inevitably, things have been made worse because of a decade of neglect from the Conservative Government. Waiting lists are soaring, hospital admissions for mental illnesses are up and patients continue to be sent miles away from home for treatment. Shamefully, the Tories have cut a quarter of all mental health beds in England since . Labour would begin to put things right: weaposd guarantee mental health treatment within a month for all who need it, setting a new NHS target, and ensuring that patients start receiving appropriate treatment – not simply an initial assessment of needs – within a month of being referred. Labour would recruit , new staff so that one million more people could access treatment every year by the end of our first term in office and ensure that mental health gets its fair share every time new funding is provided to the NHS.Tory ministers are not taking the action we need to end the mental health crisis. Only Labour will enact the real change needed to improve millions of lives. It breaks my heart, as a frontline medic, to have to tell patients that the services they rely on just are not there anymore, like the addiction support services so many desperately need. With liaison nurses working flat out, emergency departments around the country - often badly short-staffed - have to send home those struggling with addiction and seeking help.This World Mental Health Day the theme is ‘Mental Health in an Unequal World’ – very fitting after the pandemic has laid bare the inequalities we all face, including here in the UK. While the virus itself doesnapost discriminate, it hasnapost hit all of our communities equally. The inequalities are vast and stark. Many of the frontline staff who died from Covid- were Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic.As Doreen Lawrence ’s review showed, the causes of Covid’s disproportionate impact on these communities were systemic. I was told of many incidents, across multiple hospitals, which showed the impact of these structural inequalities on inidual Black hospital housekeeping staff, who were being sent to clean rooms, without protective masks and gowns, after patients had died from Covid.As I saw first-hand in intensive care, row after row of patients were from our Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. Some of them had, in turn, been caring for our loved ones, stacking our supermarket shelves and keeping our public transport moving.It was the health inequalities that are all too prevalent in our society that permitted the virus to ravage our communities - to the eternal shame of Tory ministers. The knock-on impact on mental health is devastating and is all too visible on the frontline including, for instance, the rising numbers of eating disorders in young Asian women.Extra s must be taken to ensure mental health treatments are tailored for specic communities. When I was training in AE, for example, I learned that in some languages, there isn’t even a word for depression – instead terms such as ‘all-over body pain’ are used to describe a range of mental illnesses. Our communities are being failed - but the Tories donapost care. Only Labour can ensure that proper action is taken before itaposs too late.The Daily Mirror is launching our new campaign HeadStrong: Better Mental Health For All.

The Government is also letting down a generation of young people. Even before the pandemic, children were being denied desperately needed treatment – in  , % were turned away from mental health services despite a referral from a professional. During the pandemic, this figure has soared to % of our children. They are lost in the system - the hidden victims of the pandemic and a decade of Tory cuts. Their futures are uncertain and the effect on them and their families is appalling. In AE, it often feels that the age of those coming in self-harming or with eating disorders is getting younger and younger. When I first started  years ago, it was not uncommon to see teens, but now my colleagues and I are having to treat far too many young children, often pre-teen, with some as young as . Trust in the system has been entirely degraded over time. How I hate having to be the doctor who tells another teenager that Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services simply can’t come and see them, again.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror  All our children deserve proper mental health services so their illnesses can be caught, and treated, as early as possible. That’s why the next Labour Government is committed to providing specialist mental health support in every school, to support pupils and resolve problems before they escalate. Labour would put a full-time mental health professional in every secondary school and a part-time professional in every primary school. For all the children who would feel safer accessing mental health support outside of school, Labour is committed to having an open-access mental health hub for children and young people in every community, providing early intervention and drop-in services.  Throughout the pandemic, our health and care staff have been the glue that have held our country together. The impact that Covid has placed on them, coming after years of erosion of our public services, is taking its toll. Colleagues from across the country are telling me they are burned out, exhausted beyond measure and concerned that the pressure on services means they can’t always give their patients the very best of themselves. Labour announced our Care for Carers package last June, to ensure that all three million health and care staff could get the tailored support they need as a result of the extra pressures they face because of this virus. None of us NHS and care professionals were trained to face this much death. It’s been hugely, but predictably, disappointing then that the Government has persistently ignored our concerns and those of frontline staff across the country – no amount of clapping, however well-intentioned, will ease the burden - only properly tailored support will. Ministers must stop ignoring staff. Otherwise, they shouldn’t be surprised when more and more leave the professions they love so much. I’m proud to support the Mirror’s HeadStrong campaign – it seeks to make such huge progress in reducing the stigma around mental illness, encouraging more people to seek help. We now need a government which will ensure that proper support and treatment is available when people need it the most. This Conservative Government is failing the mental health needs of our country – only Labour has a truly transformative package to tackle one of the most urgent issues of our time.

Often the names are inspired by favourite singers, places, people or in one womanaposs case her childhood doll. The woman explained that when she and her sister were kids, they used to play house all the time, and would choose names for their doll, acting asit were their daughter. Although they would change the name often, Harlow was their favourite. Fast forward a few years, and one of the sisters, now , has given birth to a baby girl whom she decided to give that name. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.I really like this name and when I suggested it to my partner, he did as well, she wrote in her Reddit post.We chose it for our daughter and decided not to tell anyone the name until birth . But when she announced the name to her sister Mary, , she reacted very poorly, shouting and calling me an a**hole. Mary screamed at me, that I stole the name we picked out together and didnapost even tell her, that I had no right to take her name. She said that Iaposm tainting the memories of our childhood and erasing her. She has not spoken to me since and hasnapost even seen her niece. I think I might have been too mean for screaming back at her and not trying to understand her side of the story, but we havenapost mentioned this name in years and I didnapost think that it would be such a big problem.   She concluded her post by asking whether she was in the wrong for not trying to understand how her sister felt, but users were in agreement that her sister was childish and that refusing to meet her niece is ridiculous. One person said: You had a kid first and it was a name you both gave your dolls growing up. Your sister is being childish. Another wrote: I just don’t get people claiming names. She’s mad you named your kid Harlow, but I’m guessing she wanted to do the same thing, right  Telling her beforehand wouldn’t have changed anything. She’d just have been mad about it longer. And, not seeing her niece because of it is ridiculous. But a third admitted: You’re right but sometimes name taking is annoying. My cousin named his firstborn after me, didn’t think anything of it. He named his second kid after my sister, and we thought ok weird but whatever. The third kid he named after my kid and I was pissed. The icing on the cake is he named their dog after my deceased one. Someone  added: If she didnapost say anything like aposI want Harlow to be my future daughters nameapos then no def NTA. Also, donapost think you should have given a heads up. Names usually come from somewhere , the name wasnapost used in years. When  your sister stops crying just tell her itaposs a tribute for all your wonderful memories together. Her ego is so big sheaposll probably believe it.What do you think  Is the woman in the wrong  Let us know in the comments.Comment MORE ON ParentingReddit\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Alexis LaRue, , went viral after posing with her seven-month-old twins, with viewers left stunned at their size. She was accused of overfeeding the girls - who are both lbs - and had to share a video of her weighing her babies to prove their size. Alexis, from Minneapolis–Saint Paul in Minnesota, USA, weighed lbsand ’ before she became pregnant, but at  weeks along sheaposd increased to lbs . She gave birth to her baby girls in March with Camila arriving at : am weighing lbs oz and Elena one minute later at lbs oz. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter hereNow, at nearly seven months old, the cute tots have already tripled their birth weight at almost lbs each. Alexis said: They just really seem to enjoy trying new foods. Whenever I am eating something, they always stare at me asthey’re waiting for me to give them some. Alexis was  when she found out she was pregnant with fiancé Leo Mejia, , and was overjoyed. My one goal in le was to be a mum so I was incredibly excited it was coming true, she added. I was only six weeks along when I had my first ultrasound and we saw two little sacs on the screen. Not having any twins in our families, I was completely shocked, but I was also so excited. The stay-at-home mum added: In the twin community, it’s pretty normal to expect babies around lbs or less. I had already bought preemie-sized clothes for the twins, as I thought they were going to be very small. However, with the combined weight of almost lbs, the girls went straight into newborn and have been growing very rapidly since. Camila and Elena are eating oz of baby formula every couple of hours, and have just started moving on to solids. Dad Leo is apos, so the fact the twins have shot to apos in just over half a year has come as a surprise to the family. They are both at the top of the percentiles for weight and height, said Alexis. I do find myself having to buy them new clothes quite frequently - they are very fast growers. At seven months, they can wear anything from  months to  months clothing.As soon as the twins were born, Alexis started making videos with them for her TikTok account, @themejiafamily_ when bored at home.But they never imagined the attention the videos would bring. The mum said: It’s funny because when I posted that video, I didn’t think much of it. I actually didn’t think my babies were that big until I started reading all of the comments. Comments from astonished viewers include those are eight-year-olds” and “ they were standing on top of each other they would be taller than you”. There also comes some accusations that Alexis edits her videos or uses a filter to make the girls look larger, but says this is not true. She said: I can say, the angle of some of the videos does slightly exaggerate their size. I actually posted a video not too long ago weighing and measuring the babies so people could get an idea of how big they actually are.I do also get a lot of accusations of overfeeding them, however, it is very dficult to overfeed a baby.

Aiyana, who asked that her second name be withheld, recorded the surreal footage from the roof of her home in Chicago, Illinois. The video shows a long black wishbone shape hanging in the air, with both its wings ending in some sort of sphere. She said: “I literally have no idea what it was. There is nothing comparable. “It was a ball of some sort with two long strings or belts hanging from it. The strings had knobs in the middle and bottom.” Aiyana and her son said neither of them “had any idea what we were seeing”. She said she stayed watching it until it disappeared from view. “It seemed to just float slowly south east without any other major movement,” she said. “It covered a few miles in about  minutes.” “I felt total confusion and a bit creeped out,” she added.Hoping to find answers, a friend shared Aiyana’s footage with UFO watchers online but no one was able to explain how an object could float so calmly above the famously “windy city”.One person wrote: “Iaposve never seen a balloon just hang still in the open air like that. It should bob, evenjust a little. There must be absolutely zero wind there.” Another person described the sighting as “bizarre”, adding: “I have no explanation. It looks like something hanging from a helicopter, except there is no helicopter. “The shape is too weird for it being a balloon, and I think I can also exclude it being an antenna on top of a building in cloud cover – for this, it is way too clearly defined. “I have no idea!”  A third said: “A balloon usually has some movement. I live in Chicago. Even on a still, calm day, Chicago and the surrounding areas have wind of some sort and would move something in the air.” The unexplained sighting is just one of several in the US in recent weeks. Another video, captured in Baltimore, Maryland, attracted a deluge of comments revealing identical sightings in numerous states. In September, a man spotted what appeared to be glowing orange UFOs “flying in formation” when ing home. When he posted the footage online, social media users recalled similar sightings in Washington DC, Las Vegas, St Louis and Detroit. Meanwhile in the UK, a woman was left baffled after capturing an image of a possible UFO hovering in the evening sky over St Helens, Merseyside while taking a friend on a late-night drive.She later toldthe Liverpool Echo :I couldnapost see any lights around it or anything, you can just see the blue thing in the sky. I was just taking a picture of the Moon while we were out because I thought it looked nice.”She added: “We were just like oh, my god, it does look like a UFO. It does look like a ship, it doesnapost look like a plane or a light, it looks like a UFO. I sort of believe in them. Iaposm not a strong believer but I do believe there are aliens out there and stuff like that. It’s interesting. You can see it but it was strange. I believe more now I can see it.

In April , six mineworkers were admitted to hospital with coronavirus-like systems after working in a bat-infested cave. Three eventually died. According to Dr Latham, the virus that eventually became SARS-CoV- and caused Covid- may have evolved inside the bodies of these miners before escaping into the population, through samples of the disease that were sent to researchers in Wuhan. The emergence of the Alpha iant in Kent last year from a single immunocompromised patient, he suggests, is evidence that the virus can make “strange evolutionary leaps” when inside an inidual for a long time.  Speaking at a British Medical Journalwebinar, Dr Latham said: The theory requires many hundreds of mutations in one miner to turn into Sars-Cov-. Decades were crammed into about six months. But we have heard of the surprising phenomenon of isolated cases of greatly accelerated evolution in viruses in Britain. As much evolution occurred in that one inidual in England as had occurred in the millions of other infections. Our theory proposes that a similar evolution was happening inside the lungs of miners following the mystery disease in  and argues that the virus leaked from a medical sample obtained from the miners infected by the outbreak. About , kilometres from Wuhan, the Mojiang mines are home to several of the lab origin theories surrounding Covid-. Back in , the workers fell sick after scrubbing a copper seam clean of bat faeces and were admitted to a hospital in the provincial capital of Kunming with persistent coughs, fevers, head and chest pains and breathing dficulties. Medical records at the time concluded the six workers, aged between  and , were victims of a SARS-like coronavirus contracted from horseshoe bats, Reuters reports. When scientists ed to the mine at the end of , they found samples of a pathogen that came to be known as the Mojiang virus”. The Mojiang virus is found in rats and unrelated to SARS-CoV-, and it was not confirmed whether it was behind the miners’ illness. Since then, China’s top bat coronavirus researcher, the Wuhan Institute of VirologyapossShi Zhengli, has said that the workersapos pneumonia-like symptoms were caused by a fungal infection and that there was no sign they had been infected with SARS-CoV-.  But the case of the mineworkers has been used by those supporting the idea that a coronavirus very similar to SARS-CoV- could have been infecting humans as early as . First identied in , a virus named RaTG was discovered from the anus of a horseshoe bat in the same caves. According to a paper by Shi and other researchers, RaTG shares .% of its genome with SARS-CoV- but must have erged  years earlier. The new theory by Dr Latham suggests that the evolution from a virus such as RaTG could have occurred far more quickly inside the body of a miner. Dr Latham said: “We know that coronaviruses were erse and abundant near the mine, and we know that some of the miners underwent y hospitalisations. “Their treatment lasted six months and allowed the evolution of novel adapted human coronaviruses.  “We know many medical samples were sent to the Wuhan institute of Virology, so the question is,what was in the samples, and what was done with any viruses that were found ”China and WIV have strenuously denied allegations that coronavirus escaped from a Wuhan laboratory but Alison Young, the Hurley Chair in Public Affairs Reporting at the Missouri School of Journalism, said lab leaks of dangerous viruses were common throughout the world, thereports. She said: “Lab accidents are not rare. In the US in  there were  reported lab exposure incidences of viruses, bacteria and toxins that the US government regulates. “Lab accidents and exposures happen frequently.” Comment MORE ON British Medical JournalUS Bioscience Inc.SarsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Olivier Rousteing, creative director of fashion house Balmain, shared a photo of his entire body and head covered in bandages as well as burn marks on his face.The French designer posted the picture on his Instagram account on Saturday, a year exactly after the incident.He said he finally felt ready to share his experience. “I’ve been hiding this for too long and it’s time for you to know,” he wrote. “Exactly a year ago, the fireplace inside my house exploded.”  He said he woke the next day at Parisaposs Hôpital Saint Louis, and has since been recovering from his wounds. He added that he had tried to hide the story of his injuries “from as many people as possible” and had tried to keep the secret with his teams and friends “for too long”. “To be honest I am not really sure why I was so ashamed, maybe this obsession with perfection that fashion is known for and my own insecurities…,” he continued.  Instead, he tried to hide his scars “with face masks, turtlenecks, long sleeves and even multiple rings” in photoshoots and interviews. A year on, Mr Rousteing described himself as “healed, happy and healthy” and thanked the medical staff who had treated him despite dealing with an incredible number of Covid cases at that same time”. Referring to the Balmain Spring Summer  show, he said it was about the celebration of healing over pain and I thank all the models the productions my team the models my Balmain family, my friends that came and supported not only my  years of Balmain but my rebirth.”  He concluded the post by writing: “There is always the sun after the storm.”The designer also shared photos of himself “hiding” in long sleeved clothing and face masks during the summer on his Instagram stories, calling it the “most dficult summer of my le”. At the age of , Mr Rousteing became the youngest and only Black creative director in the history of Balmain. The Bordeaux-born designer marked a decade at the Paris-based fashion house at this yearaposs Fashion Week with a retrospective of his Balmain designs and his spring  collections for women and men.

A spokesperson from the Mizushima Coast Guard Department announced that they would be investigating the incident to prevent it from happening in the future. Michael Fishbach, executive director and co-founder of the Great Whale Conservancy, revealed to Insider that a dozen whales are killed by a ship for each one that is recorded.  He said: Because of the negative buoyancy of the whales, they just sink straight to the bottom after they die, except on rare occasions like this one, where the whales are struck in the centre of their body, and you have a situation as you see in the above image. Thereaposs no question that the number of whales killed by ships each year is in the ,s each year.

This footage, which opens the new RNLI documentary Launch!, comes from the organisation#s impressive archives, and it was shot close to  years ago.It is the clip director Shona Thomson picked to open her film, and she believes it sets the tone for what follows.She said: #It#s just incredible: there must be about  or  men on either side of the boat, pulling it out, and then when it comes back they’re back again, pulling it in.#It’s a really physical image, and it connected with me in terms of what I wanted the film to show – this idea that it really does take a community to launch a leboat.#Launch!, which is to be shown in Aberdeen next weekend, is a documentary quite unlike the ones shown on TV which follow crew members racing to carry out a rescue against the clock.Instead, it spans decades of work by the RNLI#s inspiring volunteers, and as well as showing dramatic shouts, it taps into that deeper concept that Ms Thomson tried to weave throughout the film # community.The organisation#s integral role in Scotland#s coastal communities was a focus from the very start, when the director reached out for permission to stitch those old clips together into a longer-form piece.The RNLI was very keen to provide help, and when  was designated the Year of Coasts and Waters by VisitScotland, several more channels of funding opened up.That, plus access to the Moving Image Archive at the National Library of Scotland, gave Ms Thomson the ability to tell the story of Scotland#s leboats the way she wanted to.Among the clips is a  film called The Ben Barvis, about the Longhope crew on Orkney.Ms Thomson said: #A few years later, there was a rescue that happened, and it actually ended up that most of the crew lost their lives tragically.#You watch The Ben Barvis, and you can see crew that, only a few years later, gave their lives in service.#Another depicts a leboat naming ceremony in Whitehills, Aberdeenshire, from .The director said: #It’s a beautul colour mm film, and the whole town is out there sitting on the quayside. There must be hundreds of people out there, the whole of Whitehills probably.#They#re in their finest clothes, the boat#s there in the harbour, the crew are there with their red woolly hats, and that was shot locally.#I had to ask permission to screen that from a gentleman in Whitehills.#This is another aspect of the community theme: a town that relies heavily on the sea, supporting and celebrating the heroes who carry out rescues when it turns against them.The support carried over beyond the film itself, and into its screenings.Thanks to the fact it is largely based on requests from communities, the production#s cinema tour is dferent from a typical one: There is no date in Glasgow, but there are screenings in Liniclate on Benbecula, Castlebay on Barra and Tighnabruaich in Argyll.Aberdeen#s RNLI branch also asked for the film to come to the city, and Ms Thomson believes that the city stop shows the full breadth of the organisation#s influence.She said: #I think they’re really special screenings that we’ve got in Aberdeen, because perhaps when you think about the RNLI you look at that tour and it is very small places, it’s a coastal community and everybody knows each other.#But Aberdeen#s so dferent – they still do the same incredible job, but it#s a city obviously. The fact that the RNLI are so crucial in the city as well,  I think it’s really important.#The screenings at the Belmont Filmhouse # #such a beautul cinema# # will both be accompanied by QAs with Ms Thomson.She will also be joined by crew from Aberdeen RNLI: on Saturday October , Chloe Urquhart and Mark Gray will be there, and on Sunday October  it will be Ciaran McRae and Andy Haines.A spokeswoman for the RNLI said: #Aberdeen RNLI is delighted to be supporting the Scottish tour of Launch! at the Belmont Filmhouse next weekend and we’re excited to have some of our own volunteer crew on hand on both nights to answer questions about what it’s really like to volunteer for the RNLI.#We’re sure that the event will be an absolute success and we really hope that the local community comes out to see the film.#Tickets are available from the cinema#s website here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/eb734ee7-d9f2-452b-8c31-44052a8e92c7-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/eb734ee7-d9f2-452b-8c31-44052a8e92c7-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/eb734ee7-d9f2-452b-8c31-44052a8e92c7-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/10/eb734ee7-d9f2-452b-8c31-44052a8e92c7-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"take away takeover of empty supermarket in inverurie town centre","story":"Inverurie fast food fans will soon have another menu to browse after plans to convert an abandoned town centre supermarket were approved.

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise. Ants have no commander, no leader or ruler, but they store up food in the summer and gather their supplies at harvest.# From this we can learn four things helpful to living: be diligent and hard-working have an #I can do it# attitude plan ahead remember teamwork is important."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader october 1 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowIt#s a strange one, the fuel situation.There seems to be no one reason for it but, for whatever reason, a sort of mass hysteria seems to have taken hold where in the UK.

However, I do know that there were a lot of concerns locally about its effect on existing accommodation providers. Of course, the pandemic has also vastly altered many companiesrsquo plans for expansion.ldquoIt is good news that Lidl have said they will create  jobs at the Borders Gateway development by opening a store there.Christine Grahame - SNP MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and LauderdaleldquoWhen these plans were first announced in , I was really pleased to see Premier Inn considering opening in the Borders but I had real concerns about the choice of site. I raised this with Premier Inn and the council at the time, as I felt that siting the hotel at what is in effect an out of town retail park at Tweedbank would not support local businesses and, given the proposed provision of a coffee shop and food store at the development as well, would only serve to further dissuade guests from making the trip into Galashiels town centre.ldquoThe pandemic has brought into even sharper relief the need to support our town centre and, particularly with the opening of the Great Tapestry of Scotland, I sincerely hope Premier Inn will take forward plans in the Borders and I am pleased they are now looking for a site in Galashiels as a more viable option rather than withdrawing completely.Sandy Aitchison - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoObviously the decision of Premier Inn to pull out of the Tweedbank hotel project is a disappointment. I think a large part of that type of hotel grouprsquos business is from the mobility of the workforce and the uncertainty of the future changes to that mobility has affected their decision. That is a decision for their management to take based on their projections.ldquoPersonally I think they may have missed a trick as more and more people are discovering that the Borders is on a pathway to recovery in so many ways. The councilrsquos ambition for the future with the City Deal, Borderlands and levelling up finance coming into the Borders, is a strong weapon to ensure that our future is bright. The Borders is a great place to live, work, play and visit. More people are now seeing that fact. This means a bright future for everybody, including hoteliers.Harry Scott - Independent councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoI was very disappointed to hear that Premier Inn had withdrawn from the Tweedbank site after what appeared to be a very promising beginning. Not only would it have created jobs on site, but could have offered career progression to our young people and others through other disciplines and specialisms which a large company like Whitbread can offer.ldquoI have read that, like many companies in the hospitality sector, Whitbread has suffered quite badly financially because of COVID-, but with better times ahead, hopefully, the company may reassess the proposition and establish a presence somewhere in the Galashiels area.Euan Jardine - Conservative councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt was disappointing to hear the news that Premier Inn had pulled out of Tweedbank as it was a great opportunity for the region. However, that site will now be home to five new industrial units instead of the hotel which will create up to  jobs. A Lidl supermarket has also been confirmed in the same development.ldquoI am also very encouraged that Premier Inn have stated that they are still interested in coming to Galashiels, so we must continue to work with them in finding a suitable site. Galashiels and the Borders as a whole is evolving into a national and international tourist destination and we need the facilities to support that.Andy Anderson - SNP councillor for Galashiels and DistrictldquoIt is disappointing to see any large business walk away from a project in the Borders, especially when the original plans raised some controversy. However, as Premier Inns have expressed an interest in locating in Galashiels, this may not be a complete loss and could turn out to be Galashielsrsquo gain ndash something that the town has been crying out for. I hope that Premier Inn will engage with SBC, elected members and developers to explore these possibilities.ldquoI note that Manor Place Developments already have new proposals to make use of their site and are hoping to bring another major business to the central Borders alongside industrial units, which are possibly more appropriate to their site.David Parker - Independent councillor for Melrose and Leaderdale, and council convenerldquoDue to the pandemic, the current business climate has been dficult for everyone and Irsquom not surprised that Manor Place Developments have had to adjust their Tweedbank proposals in response to the economic climate.

explorers , years ago.And the secrets of Dunyvaig Castle continue to be revealed, including medieval gaming boards and the remains of a young hunting hound.University of Reading#s Professor of Early Prehistory Steven Mithen says long flints used by pioneer travellers from the north of Germany and Scandinavia have been uncovered at Rubha Port-ant-Seilich at what could be the first preserved Ice Age campsite in Scotland.Finding the blades, which would have been attached to an antler or bone shaft and used to clean animal skins, gives a good indication that the excavating team has found a campsite which dates to right at the end of the Ice Age.It was a time when Scotland would still have been joined to the continent by Doggerland and experts think the explorer travellers would have come on skin boats.Sediment taken from the Ice Age layer will now be tested for ancient DNA of plants and animals to build a more detailed picture of the everyday lives of those visitors.The Ice Age finds were found below a preserved hunter gatherer camp from the middle of the Stone Age, where evidence of a fireplace in a dwelling, was earlier discovered.It was only when pigs were brought in to eat bracken on the coastline that the flints started to turn up, which Professor Mithen dated to the Mesolithic period.He said Dunyvaig Castle, a scheduled monument, also continues to reveal its secrets  below the tussocky grass, peat and rubble that bury its ancient past.Islay Heritage and the University of Reading continued exploring Dunyvaig over three weeks in late August and September with permission from owners Lagavulin Distillery and from Historic Environment Scotland.The dig was used as a training school for archaeology students.The team of  travelled to the island and worked there under strict Covid rules which meant there could be no public engagement, #tragically#, said Professor Mithen.#That will be made up for in  with public talks and exhibitions about the new finds from Dunyvaig these telling us more about its fascinating past and Islay#s history,# he added.Dunyvaig Castle, on the south coast of Islay, was the naval fortress of the Lords of the Isles and Clan Donald between the th and th centuries, and fought over by the MacDonalds and Campbells during the early th century.#Having explored several walls, buildings, and the sea-gate in  and , the task in  was to investigate the external fortications,# said Prof Mithen.#A key target was the trace of a bastion, faintly emerging from the pebble beach of Lagavulin Bay, and whatever lay beyond the bastion outside of the courtyard wall.#Although we are still assessing the results, the bastion was shown to have been constructed relatively early in the sequence of building at Dunyvaig – perhaps th century – and was quite massive in form.#It had a triangular shape that is unique for Western Scotland, indicating the status and strategic signicance of Dunyvaig.#To the east of the bastion, the walls of an equally massive building were found, the existence of this building having been quite unknown.#The walls had been carefully built using large boulders mortared together and plastered on the inside face.#Its original purpose remains unclear, as does its date, but we are tempted by the idea of a grand hall, one where visitors would have been wined and dined, alliances formed and battleplans devised.#After it went out of use, the building was used as a rubbish dump – providing ideal finds for archaeologists.#Large quantities of butchered animal bones were dumped, primarily from cattle and sheep that will tell us about the diet and the economy of the castle, while pieces of pottery came from plates and vessels which will be invaluable for dating once classied.#The carcass of a dog was discarded, possibly buried, into the midden. Although yet to be identied, it seems to be the skeleton of a juvenile, perhaps a hunting hound of the type sometimes depicted on medieval grave slabs.#An unexpected find within the midden was a collection of medieval gaming boards – pieces of slate incised with lines on which games known as Fox and Geese and Alquerque had been played.#An especially exciting and useful find was a coin dating to James VI that would have been struck in the late th or early th century.

Kick off is pm.For more information follow @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 8 2021","story":"I love how the green leaves of the trees slowly change into a golden yellow colour before the tree disperses of them and they gently fall to the ground.The tree seeks a time of rest in winter and therefore needs to let go of all its decayed leaves so that it can bud in spring and flourish in summer.Watching this process reminds me of an important lesson that we can learn from the trees as we enter into the autumn period and look ahead to the winter months.Just as the trees don#t stubbornly hold onto their dead leaves, so must we seek not to hold stubbornly onto any unnecessary hurtful weight in our lives.Ephesians  v  –  reminds us that we need to get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger, brawling and slander, along with every form of malice.Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.Are you perhaps holding onto something that is preventing a freshness to the season ahead Could it be that the decayed leaves are piling up in your heart and you need to discard of them for good If so, why not reach out to the Lord in prayer because He longs to hear from you.Ask Him to reveal any thoughts, circumstances, issues, or any other #decayed leaves# that you may be stubbornly clinging to, so that you can release them and watch the leaves fall and drt away this season."},{"url":null,"title":"three points for pupils u17s after incredible comeback","story":"Campbeltown Pupils s ed to Kintyre last Sunday with three points after a remarkable Glasgow and District Youth Football League match.Trailing - with  minutes to go, the Ardshiel Hotel-sponsored side clawed it back and won - with an -minute winner.Despite a bright start, the Pupils were behind - after nine minutes.Two minutes later, it could have been - but for the brave defending of Kyle Paterson as he made a last ditch tackle which resulted in the youngster leaving the park with a nasty head knock # and not ing.This was a huge blow to the Pupils and worse was to follow as Cambuslang Rangers made it - from yet another set piece.Having weathered the storm, the visitors found their way back in to the game and reduced the deficit to one when Calum Ellis raced through on the th minute to make the half time score -.A positive start in the second half was quickly dampened as the North Lanarkshire side made it -.Ryan Shields closed the score line again as he raced through and showed composure with a fine finish, only to see the home side increase the lead to -  seconds later.Worse was to follow as the Cambuslang side made it - with a fine -yard strike.With  minutes remaining, it looked like the under-s were facing their first defeat of the season.However, there is a fighting spirit and never say die attitude in the teenagers that will serve them well as they develop into the adult game.With a spirited team display by every single player, Calum Ellis scored to make it - before pulling another back with  minutes to go.The equaliser was to follow on the th minute from Ellis before he scored his fth of the day with a penalty box scramble to make it - to the Campbeltown side.#This was a truly remarkable comeback in a game that will be talked about for many a year,# said manager David Paterson.The s have no game this Sunday due to the school holiday."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as ldquoa real dream come true.She said: ldquoWe are really excited.

So I gleefully paw my way through any new anthology when it appears ndash looking for something fresh, some tale or insight Irsquove yet to discover, all the while hoping that each new book that arrives will inspire others to fall in love with the foundation stories which shape the remarkable tale of human le.Jeffs is at her best when shersquos sting through the soil of ancient mythology for nuggets of truth, trying to uncover what fact may lie within a myth. Itrsquos a hard job, like uncovering the microscopic grain of grit which formed the pearl inside an oyster. The study of the truths which lie within myths is known as Euhemerism. The best example is the myth of the Cyclops. Ancient Greeks discovered the skulls of mammoths lying buried deep under their fields. When these huge skulls were excavated, they appeared to have one giant eye in the middle of the forehead ndash itrsquos where the trunk wouldrsquove been. However, Ancient Greeks, unaware of long dead beasts called mammoths, assumed these were the skulls of a giant with one eye ndash and up grew stories of the Cyclops. Likewise, the legend of the Gryphon ndash that strange bird-monster of mythology ndash began in central Asia where the fossilised nests of dinosaurs were found by ancient peoples, together with eggs and the bones of creatures that seemed like giant, monstrous birds.Jeffs takes us back to the foundation of Britain when legend tells us that mysterious people from the east settled our islands. First comes Albina, the rebellious daughter of a king from the lands where Syria now sits. Not long after the Flood, shersquos cast out by her father and lands in Britain ndash gting us the name of ldquoAlbion for the entirety of the British Isles. Later, Brutus, a descendant of Troy searching for a home, arrives on these shores. He gives us the name ldquoBritain, corrupted from ldquoBrutus.We know that the people who first settled these islands did indeed come from somewhere to the east. Ancient DNA tells us that. So, is there some cultural memory echoing within these myths that Jeffs tells  Are these legends a remnant of ancient migration  Do they tell a story about the very mixed blood which runs through our mongrel veins The legends of the Scots have eastern echoes too. If you read the text of the  Declaration of Arbroath, yoursquoll see references made by the authors to those who founded Scotland coming from ldquoGreater Scythia via the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Pillars of Hercules, and living in Spain among the fiercest tribes for many years. That implies a journey from the Russian steppe via the Med, past Gibraltar to the western shores of Spain. Jeffs tells of Scota, the foreign queen who settled first in Ireland and gave her name to the tribe, the Scotti, whorsquod one day settle Scotland. In Scotarsquos myth she travels from the eastern Mediterranean to Spain, then on to Ireland. History shows that the Irish ldquoScotti tribe eventually came to dominate Scotland. Scota had a son called Hyber ndash he gives his name to Hiberniaand the Iberian peninsula.Studies of ancient DNA have linked northern Spain and Portugal to Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall ndash old Celtic lands. Our myths contain hints of something deep that wersquoll never understand ndash stories about migration from east to west, of a staging post in Spain, of settlement in these islands, thought to be the very end of the world in ancient times. It makes the mind wander. What brought these people all the way here  Might perhaps the survivors of a shattered civilisation ndash even Troy, which we know today did exist as a city and was destroyed in the Bronze Age ndash have made their way here more than , years ago to build a new le  Is that what these myths ndash layered by millennia of retelling ndash whisper For this strange frisson of partially glimpsed knowledge, Jeffsrsquos book is worth the cover price alone. And yet, as a work on British mythology this beautul book issomewhat lacking. Although itrsquos built chronologically, starting back in prehistory and working forward to the time of the Picts then William the Conqueror, the book is strangely compiled. Therersquos a looseness about the story selection, a slightness to the tellings.At times, the tales donrsquot hang together as a collection. The sense of a unying mythos is missing as yoursquod expect with a primer on Greek, Roman or Norse legends. Some stories start and end randomly. Therersquos also a feyness ndash almost diaphanous dreaminess ndash to the writing which seems misplaced. Feyness is for fairy tales ndash and myths arenrsquot fairy tales. Myths are rough beasts. Jeffs, who has the elegant hand of an artist as proved by her gorgeous linocut illustrations, should perhaps have been harsher, more direct in her tellings."},{"url":null,"title":"review-trust-gxt-922-ybar-gaming-mouse","story":"A stylish and feature-rich gaming mouse.Good points Being a gaming control device the Ybar provides accuracy and speed of movement which is essential to succeed in most typical genres.A resolution of  dots-per-inchallows subtle or direct motion to a particular point on-screen.

If anyone in these areas sees a grey squirrel they can help by reporting it on our website.Saving Scotlandrsquos Red Squirrels, a National Lottery-funded partnership project led by the Scottish Wildle Trust, works across Scotland to reduce the spread of grey squirrels. In Tayside, it focuses on what is known as the lsquoHighland Linersquo ndash a km-wide strip which runs from Montrose, through Kirriemuir, Dunkeld, Crieff and beyond to the west.A key concern is that incoming grey squirrels in the northeast might connect with an existing lsquoislandrsquo population in Aberdeen which was introduced in the s, with devastating implications for neighbouring reds.Grey squirrels are native to the oak-hickory woodlands of the eastern states of America and were brought to the UK in the early th century as pets. When their popularity waned, they were released to the wild, quickly overwhelming populations of smaller red squirrels.The first grey squirrels in Scotland were released on the shore of Loch Long in Argyll and Bute in . Within two decades, greys had covered an area of around  sq-km and arrived on the east side of Loch Lomond.At around the same tim, red squirrel hunting was at a peak. Between  and , the Highland Squirrel Club culled , red squirrels.The destruction of native woodland, habitat fragmentation and changing land use has also affected red squirrel numbers. There are now thought to be just , red squirrels in Scotland, which makes up % of the entire UK population.However, efforts are being made to reintroduce red squirrels in areas where numbers have disappeared. Since , Findhorn-based charity Trees for Le has relocated  red squirrels from areas with thriving populations to nine woodlands across the Highlands.Seven sites in the Wester Ross area - Ben Shieldaig, Coulin Estate, Inverewe Gardens, Attadale, Plockton, Letterewe and the Reraig peninsula ndash have seen red squirrels re-introduced.The charity has also released red squirrels at Spinningdale on the shore of Dornoch Firth in Sutherland, and the Ardtornish Estate at Lochaline on the Morvern peninsula. Young squirrels have been sighted at every site following the breeding season.Richard Bunting of Trees for Le, said: ldquo\"Many Highland woodlands offer the reds excellent habitat far from disease-carrying grey squirrels ndash but because reds travel between trees and avoid crossing large areas of open ground, they canrsquotto isolated woodlands without our help.ldquoThis project shows the positive dference that rewilding can make for nature, wildle and people.ldquoWe are giving red squirrels a helping hand toto some of their long-lost forest homes ndash so they can flourish again in the woodlands where they belong for the first time in decades.ldquoThis is leading to signicant new populations of this much-loved species. Its offering real hope for the long-term survival of Scotlands precious red squirrels.However, itrsquos been argued that without more drastic conservation measures, red squirrels could disappear from the UK by .And there are also concerns that grey squirrel damage to young trees could hinder efforts to lsquorewildrsquo woodlands and efforts to plant new forests to help with carbon capture targets. Damage caused by squirrels costs the forestry sector poundm per year.Targeting grey squirrels with contraceptives to control the population and gene technology are both being explored as alternatives to culling.Andrew Kendall of the European Squirrel Initiative, said: ldquoPlanting millions of trees is a futile waste of money, because unless grey squirrels are controlled, these trees will not grow to achieve their full ability to sequester carbon. They will never be fully grown trees, they will be destroyed and all the money spent will be wasted.The ESI is working with Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to develop gene engineering technology which would drive sterility in female grey squirrels ndash potentially eradicating the UK population over a -year period.The technology is expected to be in place within five years but will face a range of hurdles to overcome before it might be introduced.However, Mr Kendall does not anticipate any public outcry over the potential loss of the grey squirrel.ldquoWe have conducted many opinion polls on attitudes towards controlling grey squirrels using a non-lethal method of control, and over % say they would support that, he said.ldquoWe have no concerns over gaining public support - they know unless grey squirrels are removed, there will be no red squirrels."},{"url":null,"title":"bitter-sweet-tiny-tart-crab-apples-super-powers","story":"And unless theyrsquove been smothered in sugar and used in jellies and preservatives, the tart and tiny fruits would seem to be fairly useless.However, a major DNA project is now looking into whether the much-maligned Scottish native crab apple might have genetic lsquosuper-powersrsquo which could help boost the fortunes of other, tastier, ieties in the face of climate change.A native crab apple from the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh is among  apple ieties ndash around half of them Scottish heritage apples with names like Bloody Ploughman and Stirling Castle ndash to have had their genetic lsquoblueprintrsquo successfully sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Le project which eventually aims to sequence the genome of all , species of complex le in Britain and Ireland.Unravelling the DNA of apple ieties means scientists can now study the relatedness and origins of the apples and analyse whether useful genes may be found to help boost resilience to weather conditions, disease or improve taste.The native crab apple is of particular interest to scientists as, unlike domestic cultivated ieties which made their way from East Asia along the Silk Road route as a result of passing traders and animals, its roots lie in the aftermath of the last ice age, when the European crab apple colonised the British Isles.The hope is that Scotlandrsquos surviving native crab apple trees undiluted as a result of hybridisation with domestic apples, might harbour specic genetic features which could be used to improve the fortunes of their tastier neighbours.Of course, the suggestion that crab apples may have super genes will bring little comfort to gardeners currently faced with picking countless tiny apples from their lawn.However, Dr Max Coleman of RBGE said: ldquoEven though crab apple fruits are small and sour, there might be genetic qualities that could be beneficial to our domestic apple crops.ldquoIt might be that there are some disease resistance or adaptation to local conditions maybe where the apple comes from the climate might be dferent ndash the west coast for example ndash which makes them more resilient to certain weather conditions.ldquoThere could be something really genetically useful in the wild apple.The pound.m Wellcome-funded Darwin Tree of Le project has been described as having the potential to transform bioersity for the next century and beyond. It aims to sequence the entire genome of  species during its first phase.The genomes will then provide unprecedented insight into how species evolved and uncover new genes, proteins and metabolic pathways which could help develop new treatments for disease or solutions to the issue of food security.While RBGErsquos focus has been on providing the project with ferns, bryophytes, lichens and Scottish flowering plants, its collection of heritage apples - which includes names long since overtaken by supermarket ieties ndash have already been analysed.Dr Coleman said genetic work has already established that domestic apples originated in Asia. ldquoIt is easy to imagine the apple trees in the RBGE garden have always been here and that the apple is a native Scottish tree. But in fact the domestic apple is a product of travel and trade, of accidents in hedges and painstaking hard graft.ldquoIn the forests of the Heavenly Mountainthe Central Asian wild apple can look much like our familiar fruit. Thousands of years ago people and animals on Heavenly Mountain picked the largest, sweetest fruit and this was the first step on the road to domestication.ldquoPeople and animals spread apples as they travelled.These crossed naturally with wild apple species in Siberia, the Caucasus and Europe, enabling apples to adapt and adding genetic iability, he added.From there, gardeners used cultivation techniques to adapt apples into sweeter, larger or more robust ieties.While there are now over , ieties of apples in the UK ndash and , worldwide ndash shoppers often find themselves restricted to a handful of familiar supermarket ieties such as Golden Delicious, Pink Lady and Granny Smiths.While traditional Scottish apples such as James Grieve, Coul Blush Hawthornden and Bloody Ploughman which were once grown in vast quantities, now tend to be restricted to inidual gardens and small orchards.The lsquopurersquo native crab apple may be eventually become even rarer ndash a study carried out in  claimed hybridisation with domestic apples and crab apples could lead to their disappearance in the same way the wild cats are affected by hybridisation with domestic cats.The research, led by forestry consultant Rick Worrell, studied around  native crab trees in Scotland, with around  to % in the uplands found to be true lsquoMalus sylvestrisrsquo rather than hybrids or other species, while in the lowlands, domestic apples and hybrids appear to be in the majority.The research also revealed how most of the native crab apples studied appeared to be ldquoincredibly resilient adding: ldquoThey blow over and resprout freely as lsquophoenix treesrsquo. They frequently grow hollow then collapse, but then get a second wind and start growing again.ldquoBroken limbs will live on and recover provided they are connected to the main stem by the thinnest strip of bark. So far, we have only found one tree apparently affected by disease.Leaves from the RBGE gardenrsquos apples were sent to the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridgeshire where sugars, proteins and other chemicals were removed and the long strands of DNA were carefully extracted. High powered machines are then used to read the millions of letters of the apples DNA.While the project is currently sampling just one native crab apple, itrsquos likely that there will be slight dferences in the genetic make up of crab apples found in dferent parts of the country, where trees have adapted to specic conditions.Dr Coleman added: ldquoGenerating the genome gives us a starting point for this specic crab apple, but I would predict there would be iations across Scotland.\"By unpicking the secrets of our applersquos history, as recorded in its DNA, we can understand and protect the incredible ersity of these fruits for generations to come.Tie piece Once thriving in orchards across the country ndash in particular in the Clyde Valley were commercial fruit growers produced homegrown ieties ndash once common Scottish ieties of apples with evocative names and distinctive tastes have been overtaken by supermarket ieties.Bloody Ploughman was cultivated in the mid-th century and said to have been named after a ploughman who was caught stealing the blood red apples, and consequently shot.Stirling Castle, a flat cooking apple said to be good for making apple foam, was developed by a Stirling nurseryman in .

Nature needs us to be able to use the law to defend it, and we must have the ability to go to court to hold public bodies to account where necessary. Faced with the climate and nature emergencies this is more important than ever and we have already wasted too much time. The environment is in trouble and the rule of law needs to step up to the mark.\"Conservation charity John Muir Trust has spoken out of its concerns about the rights to environmental justice after its attempt to challenge a windfarm development four years ago led to it facing a near pound, bill, although this was eventually negotiated down to pound,.The Trust settled out of court with the Perth-based energy company SSE and the Scottish government after its attempt to block a wind farm through a judicial review near Loch Ness failed.The dispute was over a wind farm at Stronelairg, which is in wild land in the Monadhliath mountains near Loch Ness. Consisting of  wind turbines, it was proposed by SSE in  and granted by the Scottish government in June .Ministers are under new pressure to create a new one-stop-shop Environmental Court for Scotland.Mike Daniels, head of policy and land management at the John Muir Trust said their case highlighted the fundamental issues there were in challenging environmental issues using the Scottish justice system.\"The lsquoDavid versus Goliathrsquo nature of charities taking on multinational corporations and the associated financial risks is a major disincentive against taking legal action on environmental grounds and therefore a potential injustice that an environmental court should right. Justice should be available to all regardless of financial ability,\" he said.The Trust and other environmental charities are also calling for an Equal Right of Appeal.Currently, only applicants have the ability to appeal refusals of planning permission.An Equal Right of Appeal would give charities and local communities the opportunity to appeal planning approvals.The Scottish Environment LINKof more than  conservation groups says its recent survey conducted by ScotPulse showed that people of Scotland believe that better environmental protections would make the nationa better place to live, benefit the economy and help protect the country from the effects of climate change.It said last month that while the SNP-Greens deal includes a commitment to legally binding nature recovery targets - there needed to be more urgency in taking action.Two years ago, the Scottish Government countryside agency, then known as the Scottish Natural Heritage , said it was failing to meet  of the  targets - now it is .:Revealed: the rare Scots wildle at risk of extinctionA host of environmental groups then contacted MSPs and the Scottish Government to express their disappointment at the failure to meet most targets describing it as a \"wake-up call\". They also criticised the positive spin being put on progress.The then environment minister, Roseanna Cunningham MSP, at that point insisted that Scotland was ldquoleading the way in its work to protect and increase bioersity and was ldquoon track to meet  targets.The on track line was repeated in in January, last year, when conservation groups warned some of Scotlandrsquos most famous wildle, including Atlantic salmon, the capercaillie and the freshwater pearl mussel, could be at risk from climate change.Ann Coleman, resident of Greengairs and ERCS supporter who has been fighting environmental injustice for over twenty years said: ldquoWersquore not equal partners in the process of what happens to us and the local environment. We have no accountability.\"She said they had considered to judicial review to fight plans for proposed incinerator when it was going through planning but campaigners were put off by cost implications.The controverisal pound million incinerator and waste recycling plant at Greengairs, North Lanarkshire was originally granted by planners in  after permission was given despite receiving more than  objections on health, environment and transport grounds.ldquoWersquove been living with the largest capacity landfill site on our doorstep in Europe for decades, along with opencast coal mining,\" she said.ldquoWe have no voice. We have no right. We cannot protect ourselves.ldquoAn environmental court for Scotland is essential. We need to have the right to access justice. The environmental court needs to be affordable, easy for the public to approach for help, advice, and to take action.\"It must be affordable because at the moment the system is so geared against us that itrsquos impossible to get justice. The environmental court or tribunal needs to have an independent , ldquoThe public need an environmental court because it will give us the power to draw harmful developments to the attention of the government in a way that they will have to listen.ldquoPeople were terried about the potential cost implications of taking a judicial review. These were ordinary working people who have not got huge incomes and were not limited companies so stood everything to lose.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos commitment to addressing the twin challenges of bioersity loss and climate change is unwavering.ldquoTo maintain high environmental standards we have put in place arrangements to establish Environmental Standards Scotland as the new governance body which has the ability to keep under review the implementation of international obligations relating to environmental protection legislation and advise the Government accordingly.ldquoScotland was the only jurisdiction in UK to avoid a governance gap when role of EU Commission ended at EU Exit and are the first to place our new standards body on a statutory footing."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmAround half of an ,-tonne order of stone from Glensanda Quarry near Oban has been shipped to Orkney, the islands council has confirmed.

We are committed to ensuring our people who keep our communities connected are properly rewarded, particularly after their contribution to the country over the past  months of the pandemic.“We have worked tirelessly to protect the jobs of our people during the pandemic and done everything we reasonably can to hold constructive discussions with Unite to reach a sensible and sustainable pay agreement across our bus depots.“We are leaving no stone unturned in a bid to reach a settlement. That is why we are putting a fresh pay offer to Unite in talks scheduled to take place next week.”According to Stagecoach, bus services are facing a continuing challenging financial environment with passenger levels signicantly down on pre-COVID levels. Passenger fares are signicantly short of what is needed to cover the day-to-day costs of running services without Scottish Government support.Mr Beaton added: “We would urge Unite to end the uncertainty for our people and the customers who rely on bus services.“Strike action is completely unnecessary and would simply damage the lives and livelihoods of hard-working people, including our employees, as well as the region’s businesses.#We would urge Unite to put communities first and talk, not walk.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But pupils had to also develop their presentation skills to explain their design plans to their peers.The Spaceflight Programme, run by the UK Space Agency, has invested over £M to develop three spaceports in Cornwall, Shetland and Sutherland. The UK will soon have the ability to launch small satellites from horizontal and vertical launchers operating from spaceports located around the UK, including the SaxaVord UK Spaceport in Unst.The work done by Shetland pupils will be submitted for judging, with the winning designs announced in the coming weeks.Head Teacher at Whalsay School Garry Spence said: “Our pupils have worked really well together in their groups and they’ve been fully engaged with this competition. They’ve learned a lot about spaceports and we hope some of them have been inspired to consider work in the space industry, which realistically could soon be in Shetland.”..Shetland is on the cusp of a major boost with the UK government ready to approve the creation of an isles spaceport in Unst – aTwo inspection reports have been ed for isles schools, providing mixed results.#Nothing has changed# in the race to bring a spaceport to Unst.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting. Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4142135.jpg--.jpg?1633698699000\n","title":"portglenone firm launch innovative new coffin pod","story":"A Portglenone hearse building firm has credited the support received from Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in helping secure funding to launch an innovative ‘Coffin Pod’ which will help protect grieving families and funeral directors as the COVID- pandemic continues.Family-owned Quinn Hearse  Limousines have specialised in the design and manufacture of hearses and limousines for over a quarter of a century, and currently employ  staff.The company’s revolutionary new product has been launched following extensive market research after Quinn’s were awarded the Innovate NI Gold Standard accreditation.The Coffin Pod is a sealed glass pod which will allow funeral directors to transport coffins safely, and allow families to have open coffin wakes while observing social distancing measures.The development of the new product has been made possible with the support of a network of stakeholders, including the council’s Economic Development team, Innovate UK and Invest NI.Patrick Quinn, Company Director, said: “Innovation and new product development have been core to the business’s continued success. We had the idea to develop the Coffin Pod, after seeing the impact that Covid- was having on families being unable to properly mourn for their loved ones and to protect funeral directors in transport to their final resting place.

We continue to develop our core product ranges of hearses and limousines and have several new vehicles under development.”Speaking about the ongoing support received by the council, Patrick added:“Through our interaction with Council’s Business Client Manager, Barbara Orr we have received support through the Business Escalator and Business Escalator Plus Programmes to develop our export markets and growth development. The support through the programmes and assistance from Barbara has been truly worthwhile and I would recommend that businesses in our borough take advantage of the help available.“As we continue to move forward, we aim to make use of the assistance in the many dferent areas of running our business, to grow and create more jobs for the people of Ballymena.”Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, said: “Quinn Hearse  Limousine is just one of many companies across Mid and East Antrim to have benefitted from support via Council’s Amply programmes, since the launch of our economic development strategy in .“As well as supporting our SMEs to navigate through the current challenges posed by COVID-, we are preparing for the new economic landscape as we navigate post lockdown, and have provided expert guidance to support Quinn Hearse  Limousine with its longer-term business development strategy.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Business Escalator and Escalator Plus Programmes are part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth  Jobs Northern IrelandProgramme.To find out more make an enquiry today via midandeastantrim.gov.uk EscalatorPlus "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1633709144535.jpg--covid_19___fri_8th_october_figures.jpg?1633709144000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211008newscovid 19 fri 8th october figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows two further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

These offences mirror current offences relating to tobacco sales.Mr Swann said: Nicotine is highly addictive and, according to the World Health Organisation, exposure to nicotine whilst still in adolescence can lead to long-term consequences for brain development.In addition to the potential long-term health implications of e-cigarette use by teenagers, there are also concerns that they may act as a gateway into smoking.Youth smoking prevalence in Northern Ireland has been steadily decreasing in recent years, and I do not wish to see this trend reversed because young people, who may not have been induced initially to smoke tobacco, instead become addicted to nicotine through e-cigarettes. .app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Read MoreRobin Swann pledges to secure additional budget boost for health serviceRelated topicsRobin SwannDepartment of HealthMore On Robin Swann PremiumAmy CochraneOpinionIt’s the all-singing, all-dancing UUP, but is this what the ‘everyday’ person wants Robin Swann pledges to secure additional budget boost for health serviceCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Robin Swann issues fresh plea against ‘vaccine lies’ as four further deaths recordedAntrim care home struggling with Covid outbreak amid workforce crisis PremiumInmates in crisis held in units designed for solitary confinementMost ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsFuneral held for Rodney Shirley, tragic father-of-four electrocuted at workFormer west Belfast teacherdownloaded sick images of childrenBBC doc reveals new details about one of the most controversial killings of the  Easter RisingSam McBrideOpinionLoophole may give DUP unorthodox way to keep first minister post evenSinn Fein wins electionTop VideosPlayDerry Girls Filming  Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated Latest Northern IrelandMan sustains head injury after male forces entry to Antrim flatUK on fresh collision course with Brussels over Northern Ireland ProtocolHealth Minister details plans to ban smoking in cars with children presentStormont needs a ‘rethink’ claims UUP’s Beattie, as leader says he’s ‘playing to win’ next electionJoe Gormley had no interest in leaving Cltonville despite summer interest… his heart and soul are at Solitude, says Paddy McLaughlinLatestMan sustains head injury after male forces entry to Antrim flatRise in Covid admissions to intensive care driven by unvaccinated patients – HSEFour dead and boy fighting for his le after crashUK on fresh collision course with Brussels over Northern Ireland ProtocolMerkel and Israel’s Bennett dfer on Iran and Palestine,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mothers, fathers, farmers waking up and beginning their day. A young man going out on his morning run.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Children with Down’s Syndrome eating breakfast with their family. We see a teacher, a baker, a florist, a taxi-driver, a greengrocer, a shelf-stacker, a working mum — baby in her arms — as the day progresses.It all moves along to an upbeat song specially commissioned for the party. This is “Eurovision meets unionism”, as the commentator David McCann quipped. It’s utterly inclusive and the positive vibe is infectious.Even the opposition was impressed. Alliance’s Belfast Lord Mayor, Kate Nicholl, watched it with her two-year-old son. “He started crying when it stopped so we had to watch it again,” she tweeted.Doug Beattie has put clear red, white and blue water between himself and the DUP and TUV.The video is meant to reflect his ‘Union of the people’. Not unionists as they’re often represented in the media or by some politicians — always angry, negative, and fearful — but as ordinary folk living their lives the same as everyone . There is no single stereotype that fits.The mood in the broadcast is a million miles from that of angry protesters on the streets lambasting the protocol or those wanting to turn the clock back to another century.It’s grounded in Northern Ireland , and it’s forward looking. Never has a political leader in Northern Ireland altered the image of his party so rapidly.Beattie is just four months in the job, and the pace of change is phenomenal.There have been new, high-profile recruits an Assembly candidate from a working-class nationalist background and a drive to bring in more women, although the party has a long way to go on the journey to gender equality.Beattie will address his first annual conference in Belfast tomorrow. The most welcome guest will be hope.In just four months, the new leader appears on course to do what has eluded his predecessors over almost two decades — reverse the UUP’s decline.It has long been on the back foot. Despite Red Sky, RHI and the alphabet soup of scandals that have hit its rival, it has never been able to land a blow on the DUP.For the first time in a long time, there is excitement and confidence in the party’s ranks.The UUP is up from % to % in LucidTalk opinion polls since he took up the reins. That helps the new leader hugely. Success breeds success winning becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.But there are dangers too. Some observers believe the ‘Beattie bounce’ is over-hyped. It’s one thing changing the party’s image and making gains in the polls. Transforming its fortunes by securing votes in an actual election is a trickier matter.The weight of expectation now lies on Beattie’s shoulders. He certainly can’t be accused of playing it safe. Every unionist leader at one point or another talks of the need to change, few have followed through.There are risks involved. How will the latest party broadcast go down with traditional UUP members in rural areas Beattie’s views don’t always chime with conservative grassroots members, although his personal popularity, military background and those positive poll results help him with that section of the party.But a good Assembly election result next May is crucial for his leadership. The UUP must win more seats in Stormont.

Credit: Alan Currie Getty ImagesGillian HallidayTwitterEmailOctober   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNearly two decades on from Lisburn achieving city status, UUP Alderman Jim Dillon has recalled how, in the lead-up to the decision being announced and celebrated with the popping of champagne corks, an official visit was made to the area by then Labour Secretary of State Dr John Reid.At that point, Mr Dillon was mayor, and had been forewarned by a civil servant that Dr Reid, now Baron Reid of Cardowan, had a two-hour window and “not a minute more”.This was two months before the Secretary of State’s visit, and as Mr Dillon noted, it was important Mr Reid left with a good impression, saying: “The Secretary of State plays a big part in it. The day he came and the two hours were up, the secretary walked over to him and said, ‘We need to go now’. He said: ‘Have you another packet of fags  I’ll be here at least another hour yet’.“I came back to my secretary an hour and a quarter later and threw my hands up in the air, [saying], ‘We’re going to get this, we’re going to get this’.”When the secretary asked why he was so sure, he replied, “I just got the vibes today”.The decision was announced by then Lord Chancellor Lord Irvine in March  as part of the Queen’s Golden Jubilee celebrations, giving Lisburn a lord mayor title as well. Other places across the UK received the title.For Northern Ireland, it was a tale of two cities as Newry was also conferred with city status, with Carrickfergus and Ballymena in Co Antrim, Coleraine in Co Londonderry, and Craigavon in Co Armagh missing out.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up This year, the award is for the monarch’s Platinum milestone next year, and Ballymena is in the running for a third time, as well as Bangor.Those hoping to secure the title for their respective towns will, like Mr Dillon, be hoping for positive vibes this time round.Following the announcement  years ago, it was argued, somewhat cynically, that adding the word ‘city’ after Lisburn and Newry was simply an act of political expediency, with Lisburn pleasing unionists and Newry pleasing nationalists.Regardless, Mr Dillon insisted it was a good decision and extolled the benefits it has brought the area in the years since.“Some people will tell you that it has done a whole lot for Lisburn, and others will tell you that it’s done nothing. It’s as simple as that, but people who think it hasn’t [done anything] are not thinking people,” he said. “Cities have to start somewhere. [Modern] London started hundreds of years ago as a small town. It’s a multi-national city now. Lisburn is growing, and the problems we have are planning issues over the last while. We want to expand in dferent directions. Planning takes light years,it gets through at all.“I still think that getting city status was a good boost for Lisburn. It has allowed us to grow, despite all the dficulties. “People want to come and invest in us, simply because we are a city.”Has the award put paid to the perception some people have that Lisburn is merely a satellite of Belfast that will one day be subsumed by the capital The UUP alderman was adamant that would never happen.“In  years’ time, people will see what it has done for Lisburn. Lisburn is not a suburb of Belfast. Lisburn would never join up with Belfast. They are two very dferent places,” he stressed.“People can speculate, but it’s not going to happen. Lisburn is a very thriving place.”Former Newry and Armagh MLA Danny Kennedy was a councillor when he proposed the idea of Newry applying for city status.It was reported at the time that Sinn Fein opposed the move to become a city because of the award’s links with the Queen’s Golden Jubilee.Mr Kennedy remembers a more pragmatic response. “[While] it’s fair to say [the reaction] wasn’t exactly enthusiastic at the time, they had indicated that they wouldn’t object. It was initially a lukewarm reception from the SDLP but it became warmer,” he said, stressing that the combined unionist and SDLP support helped get the project off the ground.“What did help was the reaction and influence of the chamber of commerce. They [councillors] then quickly saw the benefits to the area.“People who were key influences in education and commerce, they in turn reached out to the wider community. “The application then took off and, crucially, avoided the political pitfall you would have thought would come with that.”In the wake of the announcement of city status, Sinn Fein’s Davy Hyland, at that point the council’s chairman, welcomed the decision, telling the BBC: “Royalism wouldn’t be a very strong aspect of le here. The main thing is the recognition that it is now a city.”The late Seamus Mallon, at that time the local SDLP MP, also praised the decision, saying it was a “great day” for the area that pointed towards a “bright future for the city of Newry”.“This is a great day for Newry and represents a strong recognition of the work which has taken place in the city in recent times,” Mr Mallon added.Jaded thinking, however, was a harder stumbling block to overcome, said Mr Kennedy.“Some people were cynical about that, saying that Newry was a town and would always be a town,” he explained.“People were cynical again when both Lisburn and Newry were awarded it, saying it was a political trade-off. People, to this day, still say that. I’ve no evidence for that.“There was genuine goodwill and they were able to assemble a group of businesspeople and sportspeople like [former Northern Ireland footballer] Pat Jennings to come on board. Figures who were recognised as leading in their fields.“It became the creature of the chamber, rather than the council. And that made it easier in some ways because it took the politics out of it.“If I got up every week and asked, ‘Any word from the Queen yet ’, that wasn’t going to work.”While he acknowledged that some people still do not see Newry as a city, he said the status had brought many benefits.“I think it’s worthwhile. You could stand on ceremony and say, ‘Now, hang on. They haven’t got two cathedrals, they haven’t got the population’,” he added.“It’s not on the level of New York and it’s not on the level of those great English cities like Liverpool and Manchester, but there is economic and cultural benefit to it.”A framed copy of the Queen’s certicate conferring the status hangs in Mr Kennedy’s home.“I’m proud of it. It’s not an exclusive achievement of myself, but I was happy to be involved,” he said.“Success has many fathers. I did propose it at council level, but I would concede that most of the spadework was done by the Newry chamber and others.”City status may be a thorny issue that falls along orange and green lines, but it can also reignite long-standing rivalries between towns. Ards and North Down Borough Council recently gave Bangor the green light to pursue city status, but it prompted consternation from councillors who represent other areas, including Newtownards.Alistair Cathcart, a DUP councillor for Bangor Central who proposed that the council support the application, insisted it was a “no-brainer”. “Why go for this now  Because the opportunity is now,” he said.“We simply don’t know when the next opportunity will arise. It’s been  years since the last opportunity. It could be another  or  years into the future for the next one.”Other representatives felt otherwise. Joe Boyle, an SDLP, councillor for the Ards Peninsula branded it “embarrassing,” while Angus Carson, a UUP councillor, denounced it as an April Fool’s joke, insisting Bangor was “going down the tubes”.DUP Alderman Stephen McIlveen, who represents Newtownards, insisted his issue with it went beyond the old rivalry between the two towns, saying it was more to do with what a city is in principle.“The process they have is that any town can apply for city status,” he said. “A lot of people will look at certain towns and think, ‘This does not fit my idea of what a city should be’.“The idea that you can have this process devalues what a city like Belfast or Londonderry might be. “A city should be an economic driver. The idea that somewhere like Ballymena, Bangor or the idea of Lisburn [as a city], a lot of people still cannot accept that because it doesn’t meet the perception of what a city is. Does that devalue what a city is ”Mr McIlveen stressed he would not support a similar proposal for his town. “I feel exactly the same way about Newtownards. I’m guessing thatyou spoke to a lot of people in Newtownards, they would feel the same way,” he explained.“The concern among the chamber in Newtownards is that Bangor,did get city status, it may adversely affect them. “While I’m a councillor for the whole borough, I am a representative for the whole Newtownards town and I have to advocate for them. “If they [Bangor] get it, great. It’s a tremendous honour to attain, but I’m not too sure that many people still consider [Bangor] worthy of being a city.”Children’s Commissioner Koulla Yiasouma agreed.  “I have lived in Bangor for over  years, I have raised my family in Bangor, I love living in Bangor, but I am from London, and Bangor is not a city,” she said.The idea of what defines a city is a concept that fascinates architect Mark Hackett, who operates a practice in Belfast and has written articles for Architectural Review magazine.He believes cities are made by citizens, rather than being made in top-down processes.“Just calling something a city doesn’t make it a city. It’s more emotional than that,” he said. “I’m talking about it more from an urban theory point of view. If you want to have a cohesive city, it needs to have a lot of things in it that people have a lot of pride in. “The ability for people to gather and express civic pride, or civic displeasure or dissent, is a very important thing. If you can’t do that, then it’s not a city or, indeed, a town.”What matters is not whether a place is a town or a city, he argued, but whether it is a “good town, a good city”, regardless of status: “It’s not about the aspiration of getting the title of city conferred from someone . It’s not important how other people decide what your status is. It’s how the residents are. Are they truly invested in their town or their city ”Alderman Audrey Wales MBE, who proposed Ballymena’s application at Mid and East Antrim council, believes the town meets the criteria and more.“Ballymena is a wonderful place. Our citizens are forward-thinking and hard-working, and it really does deserve to be a city,” she said.Itwins, it will be a case of third time lucky. As well as missing out in , Ballymena made an attempt in , when one UK town was to be granted city status to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.Although Ballymena was nominated on that occasion, it was later withdrawn.“Everyone is looking forward to it just as much as last time,” said Ms Wales.She also stressed there was no rivalry with nearby towns, with the application “fully supported by Larne and Carrickfergus”.As part of the process, applicants must demonstrate “distinct identity”, civic pride, heritage, history, tradition and association with royalty.Carrickfergus could have good reason to apply for city status, given its royal links. Along with its castle, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Baron and Lady Carrickfergus titles were conferred on Prince William and his we Catherine by Her Majesty on their marriage in .While it was not nominated, Ms Wales believes the general feeling is thatBallymena were to be successful, it would have a positive effect on the wider area overall.It would also be somewhat poetic, given the town already welcomes visitors with a sign reading “Ballymena: the City of the Seven Towers” — a proclamation that reflects the spires that once defined its skyline.Ms Wales said: “We’re known as that, so it would be nice to get that status confirmed.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadUVF psycho Alan Oliver could reveal his serial killing secretsFuneral held for Rodney Shirley, tragic father-of-four electrocuted at workFormer west Belfast teacherdownloaded sick images of childrenBBC doc reveals new details about one of the most controversial killings of the  Easter RisingSam McBrideOpinionLoophole may give DUP unorthodox way to keep first minister post evenSinn Fein wins electionTop VideosPlayDerry Girls Filming  Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland dcc .ece AUTOCROP wh nch%of%Blank%Team%.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   Blank owners, Jonny and Christina Taylor, with new general manager, Alex Daley, and head chef, Niall Duffy\"PlayVideo: New Belfast restaurant opens but there#s no menuPlayVideo: INLA gun salute investigated Latest Northern IrelandMan sustains head injury after male forces entry to Antrim flatUK on fresh collision course with Brussels over Northern Ireland ProtocolHealth Minister details plans to ban smoking in cars with children presentStormont needs a ‘rethink’ claims UUP’s Beattie, as leader says he’s ‘playing to win’ next electionJoe Gormley had no interest in leaving Cltonville despite summer interest… his heart and soul are at Solitude, says Paddy McLaughlinLatestMan sustains head injury after male forces entry to Antrim flatFour dead and boy fighting for his le after crashUK on fresh collision course with Brussels over Northern Ireland ProtocolMerkel and Israel’s Bennett dfer on Iran and PalestineAaron Ramsey determined to help Wales qualy for World Cup,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In circumstances like this, cash is king, but when you continue to stockpile cash long after you’ve reached your emergency fund number, that’s when it begins to hurt you financially.Excess savings sitting in accounts earning negative s mean the purchasing power of those savings are going down in value, and whilst that may not hurt your finances much in the short term, it’s the opportunity lost in not investing in accounts that are producing much better s that will.The opportunity cost for one client of mine who had €, sitting in a deposit account, that had no reason to be there, was €, over just one year.         I had a zoom call with her back in February and she told me she had savings of c. €, sitting in a deposit account earning .%. But when you factor in DIRT tax and inflation, her actualwas -.%.Anyway, she knew she was cash heavy, but was unsure how much of the €, she should ide up and what number should be assigned to her emergency fund and what could be set aside for investment and so on.So, what I suggested to her was very similar to what is primarily used when it comes to pension planning in retirement, and it’s known as The Bucket Strategy. I thought the concept is such a great one, it should be adapted and used when it comes to iding up the amounts people have accumulated in cash.The solution is iding up the amount you have in savings into three dferent accounts, and the amount you deposit into each account is based on:n When you need the moneyn How long you want it to last for, andn How much you need or can set asideWhen we applied this logic, the strategy for her looked something like this:Bucket Number  – Emergency FundAccount Type: CashRisk: ZeroPurpose: Covers emergency expenses for  monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,We looked at what deficit would existthere was a loss of income, and we focused on the cost of funding those priority expenses that must be covered and paid. And we discovered that monthly cost was €,.We were happy that having  months of those expenses in an account dedicated for this eventuality was enough.So, she set up a separate account, called it her emergency fund and transferred €, into it. Next up was,Bucket Number  – Short Medium Term ExpensesAccount Type: Cash Fixed TermRisk: ZeroPurpose: Known, once off expenses, incurred in the next   monthsOptimum Balance in Account: €,This is an account you set funds aside for large once off expenses you know you’re going to incur in the next  months.The women I met was planning on changing her car next year and whilst she didn’t know exactly what car she was going to buy, €, was a good number to ring fence from her savings.But rather than leaving this amount sitting in a deposit account, she moved it to a fixed notice account for  months, earning .%. It’s still a terriblebut at least it was  times better than leaving it where it was.Bucket Number  – InvestmentAccount Type: EquityRisk: MediumPurpose: Make money beat inflationOptimum Balance in Account: €,Now more than ever, you need to be invested in equity-based accounts, you just have to.We set up this type of account up for the woman I met back in February where she deposited €, into it. And theon the account since then, has been +.%. The same account had s of +.% over  year and +.% over  years.Contrast them to the .% she was making by holding excess savings in cash.It meant her €, was going down in value by € every year.But had she set aside €, a year ago in an equity account, it would have gone up by €,.And eventhe equity s dropped in value by c. % from what they made last year, they’d still be % more than what she’d getshe left her money languishing in a deposit account.Whatever way you want to present it, the dference is staggering, and the reason I said from the outset, why holding too much cash is bad for your finances.One of the long-term financial effects, Covid could leave on people, is a fear that something like this could happen again, so people begin to hoard money and whilst there isn’t anything wrong with that, it’s where they leave this money accrue that’s the problem. And that’s in cash accounts that are earning nothing. Let me repeat again, those accounts are fine for your emergency fund, but once you’ve past that amount, you really need to consider other accounts that will yield higher s.And perhaps not everyone will have enough in savings to fill three buckets.They may not have enough to fill even one, and that’s okay as well becauseyou follow this very simple strategy, it will prevent you from using money that’s being invested but should really be assigned to your emergency fund or leaving money in an emergency fund that should be set aside for investment.So, you really need to know your numbers and the dficulty I find with people, is that they have one, maybe two accounts and the amount they’ve accumulated is used for everything i.e. emergency fund, investment and once off expenses.And this is one of the reasons people are not optimising their finances. They may have spare cash that could be used towards investment, but it’s getting lumped in with emergency funds and once off expenses and it stays there and earns nothing.Having a dedicated amount for specic purposes makes things much easier because you know, you have the optimum amount in place for each purpose and you know you’re not affecting other areas, either.And using the Bucket Strategy will help. It’s not time consuming to set up, but I assure you, it will be time well spent.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

It’s what you now do with that money that’s important because it can be easy to do nothing, and within a few months, the raise gets consumed by increased spending, and this is typically known as lestyle creep i.e. as your income increases, so do your outgoings, by the same amount.     Which is a shame because when you get a raise,put to good use, it should really put you ahead financially and allow you to achieve things, you were unable to on a lower salary.If you don’t take advantage and you’re not intentional with what you’re going to do with it, you end up in exactly the same position as before, and you’re just working harder without living better and that’s not what you want.So, how do you avoid this from happening to you Ideally, you want to give some thought into how you can benefit from your new higher earnings, and I will re-visit this in more detail, in a second follow article next week, because there’s a lot to cover.         However, I do know there are those who are just looking for a number, and don’t want to carry out that deep e into what impact a specic number would have on particular areas of their finances.So, with them and everyone  in mind, I’m going to share with you three very good rules of thumb that I like and think are useful.They were first developed by the financial services giant, Morningstar, and this is what they are suggesting you should do with a raise:. Spend twice your years to retirementIf you have  years to retirement, you can spend % of your raise and save the rest.. Save your age, as a % of the raiseIf you are  years’ old, save % of your raise.. Save at least % of your raiseRegardless of your age or years to your target date for retirement is, just save % of your raise.When Morningstar ran dferent scenarios, they discovered the spend twice your years to retirement created the biggest impact across all age groups because it usually involves saving the most money.The rules I’ve referred to focus on how much of the raise can be spent rather than how much can be saved, and that’s very deliberate i.e. you don’t want people to feel they have to save every extra cent they now earn and can’t enjoy some of the raise they received.Or do they have to save everything I’ll circle back to that in next weeks’ article.In the meantime, I want to make reference to the impact continuing to save a % of your income into your pension after a pay rise is, because its’ important.Pay Raise  PensionsSome people who receive a pay increase but make no % change to their pension contribution, think they are making progress, because they are saving a higher amount, right Wrong.If you continue to save for example % of your income, of course you’re increasing your saving because it’s % of a higher amount, butyou spend the other % and continue to do so, you are increasing your standard of living by % of every rise you receive.The danger with doing this, is that as your standard of living rises, the funding needed for retirement grows at a faster pace than the amount you are saving. Which results in the gap between what you need and what you save, becoming bigger every year.Let me explain.Let’s say your income was €, and it increased to €,.If you were saving % of your salary and continue to do so after your raise, you are increasing your annual contributions by €,, and you’re now saving €, per year.Whilst you might be saving more in absolute terms i.e. % of €, is obviously more than % of €,, you need to save more relative to how much your new salary is,you want to keep up with your new, higher costing lestyle.In this instance,you save % of your raise i.e. €, and add it to what you were previously saving i.e. €,, your new annual saving rate is €,.That % saving from your raise increases your contributions to, % of your new salary and that’s why you’re giving yourself an opportunity to fast forward retirement.What all that means is that the increased retirement savings, combined with the decreased need for retirement funds, means someone aged  who saves % of their raise can retire at , which is  years earlier than someone of the same age who only saved % of their raise.Regardless of your age, continuing to save only a certain % of your salary and spending the rest, including raises, is really poor advice because it can lead to delayed retirement and underfunded accounts, and that’s’ even when your savings rate is higher.Long story short, getting a raise can actually exacerbate the problem of having a fund which is lower than you need when you decide to retire full stop. Instinctively you might think it will help because you’re saving more money.But don’t forget you’re spending more as well and how are you going to replace that You’re certainly not going to do ityou continue to save the same % your currently saving.And let me repeat, even though you’re saving more because its % of a higher amount, when you run the math, it will tell you a dferent story.Okay, next week, I’ll look at people who are carrying high debt and or low savings and I’ll give you my opinion on how much of any raise they receive, they should spend.And in the same article, I’ll also tell you about someone who asked me recently what impact the raise she received would have on her finances. She wanted specic numbers and outputs on a number of dferent areas, and I’ll share with you what we discovered, and what she decided to do.Liam Croke is MD of Harmonics Financial Ltd, based in Plassey.

The campaign aims to shine a light on older people and provide them with an opportunity to engage with a wide range of organisations and activities that offer support services and opportunities to socialise and learn new skills. googletag.cmd.push Derry City  Strabane District Council, the Western Health  Social Care Trust and the Public Health Agency have come together to create a erse programme of activities and events throughout October and are encouraging ious groups and organisations to get involved. Council is also currently engaging with the older community to shape a dedicated Age Friendly strategy for the City and District, prioritising older people and ensuring their health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the positive development of Derry and Strabane. Work is underway to create an Age Friendly structure with partners and stakeholders to co-design the three-year Age Friendly Strategy and action plan. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, said Positive Ageing Month celebrated the many positive aspects of growing older. He said: Positive Ageing Month offers the chance to celebrate the older members of our community, and the huge influence they have on our society. “The onus is on all of us to respect and engage with older citizens, and really value their lived experience and knowledge they bring to bear when shaping policies and programmes for our Council area.     More people within our local community are living longer, healthier lives, so we must ensure that those later years are enriching and rewarding for growing old in our area. “We must ensure that their needs are identied and prioritised and that we all take a more responsible and positive approach to le as we grow older. I hope to see lots of older people connecting with the programme and the opportunity to enjoy new activities.” Launching the campaign, Seamus Ward, Head of Health Improvement, Western Health  Social Care Trust said: “I am delighted to be launching this years Positive Ageing campaign. It is a great opportunity to showcase the fantastic work being carried out on the ground by older peoples groups and community and voluntary organisations. The programme of events that we have produced shows a iety of activities that exist throughout Derry-Londonderry, Strabane and Limavady areas for older citizens. In an ageing population, it is important we continue to work together to encourage older people to reach out and help them re-connect within their local community, not only to reduce social isolation and loneliness but to help them live long, healthy lives.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The campaign aims to shine a light on older people and provide them with an opportunity to engage with a wide range of organisations and activities that offer support services and opportunities to socialise and learn new skills. googletag.cmd.push Derry City  Strabane District Council, the Western Health  Social Care Trust and the Public Health Agency have come together to create a erse programme of activities and events throughout October and are encouraging ious groups and organisations to get involved. Council is also currently engaging with the older community to shape a dedicated Age Friendly strategy for the City and District, prioritising older people and ensuring their health and wellbeing is a key consideration in the positive development of Derry and Strabane. Work is underway to create an Age Friendly structure with partners and stakeholders to co-design the three-year Age Friendly Strategy and action plan. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, said Positive Ageing Month celebrated the many positive aspects of growing older. He said: Positive Ageing Month offers the chance to celebrate the older members of our community, and the huge influence they have on our society. “The onus is on all of us to respect and engage with older citizens, and really value their lived experience and knowledge they bring to bear when shaping policies and programmes for our Council area.     More people within our local community are living longer, healthier lives, so we must ensure that those later years are enriching and rewarding for growing old in our area. “We must ensure that their needs are identied and prioritised and that we all take a more responsible and positive approach to le as we grow older. I hope to see lots of older people connecting with the programme and the opportunity to enjoy new activities.” Launching the campaign, Seamus Ward, Head of Health Improvement, Western Health  Social Care Trust said: “I am delighted to be launching this years Positive Ageing campaign. It is a great opportunity to showcase the fantastic work being carried out on the ground by older peoples groups and community and voluntary organisations. The programme of events that we have produced shows a iety of activities that exist throughout Derry-Londonderry, Strabane and Limavady areas for older citizens. In an ageing population, it is important we continue to work together to encourage older people to reach out and help them re-connect within their local community, not only to reduce social isolation and loneliness but to help them live long, healthy lives.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

He was the first person you met in the morning and always had a joke or laugh to share with everyone. “He will be missed in the coming future but we want him to know that he will always be welcome to call into Destined. I want to wish him well for the future and hope that he has a healthy and good retirement.”    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Mohamad Ali, who runs the Maiden Heaven cafe in Waterloo Place, said his shops logo bears a “a striking resemblance” to the Parachute Regiment’s. On Bloody Sunday, soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were responsible for killing  innocent civilians in the city, another man died from his injuries months later. googletag.cmd.push Since then the Parachute Regiment and its flag has proven to be a contentious issue in the city. Flags can seen displayed in loyalist ares of the city in support of Solider F, who had been charged with the murder of Bloody Sunday victims William McKinney and James Wray. At an Apprentice Boys of Derry parade in , the Clyde Valley Flute Band caused controversy when theymarched through the city wearing the insignia with the letter F underneath. The flag has also been burned on bonfires in nationalist ares of the city. Mr Ali said he would never have used the logo, featuring an ice cream cone and wings, had he realised the similarity between it and the insignia the regiment. The shops barriers at its outdoor seated area also features the similar maroon colouring to berets worn by Parachute Regiment soldiers and flags featuring its insignia of an open parachute with wings. In a post on Facebook, owner Mr Ali, apologised for the logo and said that he’s “working to change it”. He said: “It has been brought to my attention over the last few days by few good friends that the logo for Maiden Heaven coffee shop and ice cream bears a striking resemblance to the Parachute Regiment insignia.     “Given the history of this city and the fact that the Parachute Regiment shot dead innocent people on the streets of Derry, I would NEVER have knowingly used a logo that would offend or hurt the people of this city that I love and the city that has been my home over the last  years. I am working now to change this. And sorryanyone was offended by this logo and color, I would never have used it to promote my business had I realised the similarity.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The bank is ceasing services at  branches in the north of the the country, and a further  locations in the Republic as part of signicant changes to its branch network and local banking services first announced in March. googletag.cmd.push As part of the major restructuring of the bank, the Strand Road branch will close with customers still able to avail of services at the Culmore Road branch. Additionally, the branch in Limavady will also close, as well as branches in Strabane and Moville in County Donegal. It said that over the last three years, there has been a % drop in the number of customers visiting the branches in question, with a rise in those using online services. Bank of Ireland said an arrangement with the Post Offce, to allow for lodgements and withdrawals, will protect local access to over-the-counter banking, allowing account holders to conduct transactions at post offices around the country. Our personal customers may use any Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques, withdraw money using their debit card and check balances. Business Customers can use Post Office branches to pay in cash or cheques withdraw money and check their balance with their Bank of Ireland UK Business Debit Card. Varying limits will apply to cash transactions, we will support customers to set up new arrangements including coin and larger cash transactions and are also planning to enhance services later this year.     Customers affected by the closures have been written to in recent months, informing them of the changes and outlining where their accounts will be transferred to. Account numbers, sort codes, along with direct debits and standing order arrangements, will remain in place. While most of the branches being closed have post offices nearby, customers wanting to access other Bank of Ireland services may now have to travel signicant distances to their closest branch. Revealed: Full list of  Bank of Ireland branch closures https:t.co DztGNaBSb — Irish Examiner October ,     The Financial Services Unionhas described the closures as a sad day for staff and customers and a real sign of the weakness of regulation in Ireland. John OConnell, General Secretary of the FSU, said Despite cross party opposition in the Daacuteil and in Stormont and across wide sections of the community, Bank of Ireland have continued along the pathway of eroding their footprint and removing vital services from communities across our country, The Regulator has clearly failed in its role of protecting customers and communities in this instance, he added. Mr. OConnell said the withdrawal of ATMs will mean there will be communities next week which will no longer have   access to cash adding that despite the increase in card payments, cash remains a vital payment method for customers. The FSU has called on the Central Bank to open a consultation paper on the future access to cash to ensure that the use of this access is safeguarded. It also called for the urgent consideration whether legislation and new enforcement powers are required in this area. Our banking sector is at a crossroads and needs a commitment from the Central Bank that the banking network will not disappear, and that they will be proactive in ensuring that communities and vulnerable people will not once again be hit the hardest, Mr OConnell added.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

This counted as P.E in the s. Long before the days of groups being brought out rock climbing or kayaking, the kids of the s were walking around the P.E hall trying to balance tiny beanbags on their heads. It never made it past the Olympic sport application, though, but we hold out hope. Teachers really had it handy back in the day! googletag.cmd.push The bin was a social hub... Getting continually chastised for talking in class was the bane of the existence of a s primary school pupil. We found a novel solution, however, as we all bought p pencil pairers and took full advantage of the rule that said pencils had to be paired at the bin and nowhere . The chats were had and many a firm friendship blossomed at the bin in the corner of the classroom. The school tour game was weak... In the s, school tours normally consisted of a trip to a local farm where the farmer was only delighted to welcome  screaming children to his place of work - NOT. We spent most of the day looking at cows and chickens, complaining about the smell, and the highlight of the day was bottle-feeding a baby goat. Those were the days, eh  What we would have given for a day trip to Tayto Park! The Don arrived... Whether it was by chance or design, for some reason on a random day during the s, artist Don Conroy from RTEs The Den turned up and drew an owl. We had to follow his instructions on a piece of copy paper and iniably ended up with a misshapen circle on top of an oval, after which we got distracted and went to the bin for another chat.     Mistakes were made... At one point or another, someone in the class made an absolute mess of the maths problems and proceeded to erase every screed of writing from his her page using a eraser. The smell of burning rubber wafted through the classroom asit was Mondello Park and poor Peters arm never recovered from the repetitive strain injury. What  could he do  Tipp-ex was strictly not allowed! Our books were routinely wallpapered... Covering school books was the order of the day because we all used the schools book lending scheme. You got the books that were used forty years earlier and in order to protect them, your poor mother had to spend the whole evening plastering them in wallpaper. Colours and styles did not matter to your beleaguered mother whatever wallpaper was left over went on, that was that! The telly was rolled in... REJOICE! At school in the s, the telly carried with it a God-like status. There was utter pandemonium when the teacher pushed it into class. The level of reaction could only have been equalledshe had pushed The Backstreet Boys in on a trolley. Absolute scenes! Iniably, the excitement dissipated when a farming or water safety video was produced, which was minus craic, but very important. Nevertheless, that momentary thrill of hearing its wheels squeaking down the hall and emerging through the door was the highlight of our primary school education. We had The News... In the very early years of primary school, we were required to write the news into our copies. The news was far from exciting and usually involved a classmates tooth falling out, trips to the zoo, or other random happenings in our non-eventful lives. In fairness, we were only five! Today is Wednesday...it is a rainy day. Accurate to this day! Ah, the memories! The Shatterproof Ruler Experiment... All of us, at one point or another, splashed out on the p shatterproof ruler from the school shop and conducted our own unofficial experiment to see could we actually shatter it. We proceeded to bend and contort the unsuspecting ruler furiously, our faces grimaced in anticipation of the impending snap. The experiment had mixed results. Some of us lost eyes due to the shrapnel, others were simply left with a bent-out-of-shape ruler in their pencil case with white strain marks down the middle. We had pencil toppers... These normally arrived free in cereal boxes and we upended the box of Corn Flakes in order to be able to go to school with a troll on top of our pencils – the absolute envy of the entire class. Trolls were popular but the toppers came in all shapes and sizes. Hey Arnolds head certainly made an appearance at one stage.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Ambition is important. Yes, that’s true. Without a level of ambition, in the modern world, we would probably be lost. We wouldn’t be sure where to go or what to do next and of course what we would like to accomplish. googletag.cmd.push The word ambition has a dferent meaning for everyone. For one person it may mean to be in good health. For another, it may mean to rise to the top of the corporate ladder. Or maybe you want to be the best parent you can be. But sometimes, ambition makes us blind and we lose sight of the reasons behind this initial ambition. Chasing something is an example of how we lose sight in the fog of ambition. Where it turns to: “I don’t have enough in le currently or presently”. Be it, more cars, more money, more houses etc. This is where ambition turns to the need for more and more. The want of “more” unfortunately will never satisfy any of us. It may have its fleeting moments of happiness where the ego becomes your shadow side - meaning that it is lurking somewhere in the background, having more control over your thoughts, feelings and actions than you may initially think. Ego is important. I would argue that it is detrimental to our happiness and fulfillment, in a physical and mental sense, when we are blinded by the ego and all it wants for us is more of something or maybe even someone.     Our ultimate mission is inidual to each and every one of us however our mission or purpose does share commonalities. We are inspired when we think of our mission. We are frightened of our mission as we are afraid of what we truly know we can accomplish once we put our minds to it. We get a sense of happiness at the thought of our mission being complete. Overall, there may be a procrastinating pull and a satisfactory push when we think of what our purpose is,we have not found it yet or taking action towards it. Society is not designed in a way for us to find our purpose and true calling. We have to go and find it ourselves. Efficiency has led to a personal deficiency where being proactive is admired and recognised more so than a person’s recognition for the need to rest. Let’s look at a question we often ask others: “Are you busy ” Questioning the “busyness” of someone  is a worthwhile example of how we are conditioned into framing conversations and boxing another human being’s value into whether they are “busy” or not. Yes, while it may be a good way to start conversation, I would question this very question as a measure of efficiency in our daily lives as existential as it may be. We have to question these things and examine where we can improve on our ways of interacting socially leading to meaningful friendships and relationships. I don’t mean that on an efficiency level but more on a deeper, human connection level Nobody has this le figured out. Many people are seen to be thought leaders in self-help, for example, but they don’t have it figured out either. Whilst the conceptualisation of certain ideas may provoke thought and conversation , nobody has it fully figured out and each one of us are on our own inidual path. I say this to support the idea that there seems to always be a drive toward efficiency in the modern world and this can now be seen in new thought leadership on self-help. We now have step by step guides, habits, graphs, routines etc. that tell us how to be more efficient - from people who certainly, although maybe experienced, do not have the answers you or I seek. Efficiency, in my eyes, is the curse to simplicity which I believe is one of the keys to living a happy, stress free le. When we strip back layers of the ego’s needs, what are we left with  I would assume that we are left with a very fragile, vulnerable and lost person which is why we need to have a certain level of ego in our lives. However, we can be mindful of what aspects of the ego we tend to build. So in an ego driven world that almost demands efficiency, leads to a spiritual and mental deficiency where we may forget to nurture certain aspects of ourselves. I would advocate a strategy that would be congruent to your overall daily set of values or importantly your sense of purpose or your mission. For example: “My mission is to be a great mother”. Firstly, define what “great mother” means to you. Does it mean fulfilling the basic food, shelter, emotional needs of your child or does it surpass that  Whatever your purpose, define what success means to you, not the world’s demand for efficiency. Overall, an Americanised, McDonalds culture of “getting stuff done” has filtered its way into most of the Western world. Whilst efficiency is welcome in certain aspects of our lives, be it our cars, coffee machines and checkouts - at what point do we press the stop button on a robotic like efficiency that we human beings have also now become accustomed to in our relationship with ourselves and others  It takes strength and often courage to get off the hamster wheel - be it your self-sabotaging belief systems, patterns of destructive behavior, your career, the role in your relationships - however, I would strongly advocate stepping back from the busy demands of le and re-evaluating what it is you really value.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

The window when the sporting acumen of the local community was dissected with a fine tooth comb. The reserves took the field at two oclock in front of one man and a dog. And by the time the game headed for the final furlong, cars would be trickling in the lane for the senior game. Elbows on the wire, the elder statesmen of the club would surmise who the best reserve players were. googletag.cmd.push “Yer man would need to take a look at Johnny,” one might offer. “Hes lording it out there.” There would be a nod back. Sport is all about opinion. With more people filing into the ground, the noise level will go up. Enter the club time-bomb. We all know them. The sort who would argue a black cat white. The man from the opposing club, who was acting as linesman, would have his line ball decision questioned. And all of a sudden chests would be pumped out and a mouthful of choice words exchanged. Often, it sets the tone for the senior game. But the double header gives reserve players an identity. Some will stay togged out for the seniors. Others will get the disco shoes and the hair gel slapped on for the few scoops down the pub later. Some will huff and puff that the senior manager doesnt rate them. A few weeks back, I was in Owenbeg for Newbridges win over Coleraine. Being early, I mixed typing up a few match reports with watching the reserve game. Alan Nash let it flow from end to end, with the senior managers looking on before taking their squad away to prepare for the main event.     There was just that united feel to it all. A group of players who trained on Tuesday and Thursday night, went to the gym together, slagged each other in the same Whats App group during the week, they were all on an even keel. Give or take a man or two, Newbridge have a senior reserve  of  training most nights. Coleraines  sits around the  or  bracket. Its the most theyve had in ages offers Ryan McGeough, their affable two-time championship winning goalkeeper who has now stepped into the role as club Chairman. Mathematically, double headers are not a problem here. But it makes for a juggling act. Newbridge manager Killian Conlan offers the conundrum of how many players to hold off reserve duty. Most clubs are the same. Who am I Iikely to use in the senior game  And its not an exact science. It brings me back to the days of watching Sunday double headers. Being taken off in the reserve game was an elevation in status. “I told ye....Johnnymust be in the senior managers plans,” offers the club stalwart. This is the problem with being the fringe player. Youre caught between two stools. Half a game here, five or ten minutes there. Formation changes, injuries, black cards and poor performance all need to be thought through. The players caught in the middle can miss out on action. The four Newbridge senior subswere held off reserve duty, including Mickey ONeill who came on with minutes to go in a game that was decided while he was on the pitch. His chasing back helped force a turnover on the way to the Bridges winning point In a scenario like Newbridge, moving up the pecking order in the Derry club scene is their mantra. Men caught in the middle just have to ride it out and push like mad for a senior place. Odhran McGlones brief was to put Sean Leo McGoldrick on the back foot, which he did with four points in an all-action  minute performance before his fuel light began to flash and PJ ONeill came in to keep them ticking towards the finish line. The Bridge were the only team guaranteed to finish top of their group before a ball was kicked at the weekend. Would they have got over the line against Coleraine without fresh legs  Thats debatable. The previous night, Sean Cassidy came on in the th minute of Slaughtneils defeat to Lavey. Having played in the reserve game, he was back in action again and fisted over a point within minutes of coming on. Every clubs circumstances are dferent. There are dual clubs, there are suspensions and there is Covid. Its all rosyyou have the numbers. Sideline View conducted a mini poll of club senior  sizes, not counting short-term injuries or any Covid- related unavailability. With the exception of Claudys  of , the other  Division A clubs have a senior  capable to fielding senior and reserve teams on the same day. Of the  responses,  squads had  players or more to fuel a senior and reserve team. A further three were in the middle bracket –  to . At junior and the lower end of intermediate level, the story is totally dferent. The remaining  clubs, were under the  number required to field two teams in one day, without needing to coax a few retired players back to fill out the team to ensure everybody gets football. Concessions dominate the results pages. Of the  intermediate reserve championship group games fixed, only four were played. Four. It has been really sore on clubs who have the numbers. On top of their senior squad of , Steelstown have a reserve  of . With the need to grow GAA in the city, not having a reserve championship game leaves it very dficult to maintain player retention. Why stay when other sports can offer more. Castledawson, Faughanvale, Glenullin and Drumsurn are other intermediate teams who didnt get their full compliment of games. Intermediate champions Greenlough had a recent in-house  versus  game, with nine substitutes. Their reserves have had a in one game in almost nine weeks. In many cases, clubs cannot field a senior and reserve team on the same night. Midweek reserve fixtures at . leave it impossible for some to get home from work on time, taking the numbers even lower again. The reserve and senior double headers of old at the weekend give the best chance toto the status quo. As this column has alluded to in the past, Saturday evening would be a better option. But it doesnt suit everyone. With a fluid situation, there needs to be a look at the future of reserve football and where it fits. Clubs should only enter a teamthey can fulfil their games and allow the CCC to restructure. For example, Desertmartin seniors are playing in the junior ranks, yet have a squad of  and traditionally were always very successful at intermediate reserve championship level. Clubs could be asked for their input into how everything could fit together. Senior managers, with input from their club committees, should look into – and be accommodated by the CCC – moving their reserve game to a dferent night, possibly a training night. One of the management team could take charge of the reserves and everyone  trains. When Ronan Rocks was in charge of Desertmartin, he phoned ahead every week to request a Friday reserve fixture. It was almost always accepted. Stephen Barker, the CCC Chairman at the time, was only too glad to accommodate it and inform the referee of the revised fixture. It takes a bit of give and take between clubs, but overall it would be a step in the right direction. Andone club fails to agree a move, then the fixture remains as it is. The days of two and half three on a Sunday have gone forever in certain quarters. The next step is to make sure the level of conceded reserve games disappears until everyone is playing on a regular basis. That has to be the goal, for the long-term future of clubs.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Fred chose Chupacandra Wizard Bull, bred by Helena Mudrova, as the top female Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Reporter: Matthew Leslie Oct Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Derry canine judge, Fred Jones flew out to the Czech Republic last week to cast his expert eye in selecting who would be the Worlds top dog. Fred, , who is also a self-employed joiner, has been part of the dog show scene for close to two decades, both in the capacity of showing dogs at competitions as well as judging them. googletag.cmd.push The breed he specialises in are Staffordshire Bull Terriers which he passes judgement over using strict Kennel Club criteria. Last week he was at the World Dog Show in Brno, Czech Republic, where he had to pick a winner from  entrants in the female Staffordshire Bull Terrier category. The one he picked was a Stafford named, Chupacandra Wizard Bull, who is owned by Czech breeder, Helena Mudrova. Fred enjoys his role as a dog judge but said its a long process before you can get to cover World shows as he does. He said: “You become a dog judge through your peers. Basically, you start off showing dogs and eventually, after a few years, somebody will invite you to judge at lower level competitions. “Once you do that, theres Kennel Club exams, seminars and certain criteria you have to meet. Its a progressive thing as it takes many years to work your way up to becoming a championship show judge. “From showing to judging my first ever low-level competition took me about four years. That was in . “In , I judged my first Irish championship. Ive travelled a bit now and Ive been to thirteen countries to judge. The World Show was a very prestigious one to get.     “All dogs are judged on their breed standard as laid down by the Kennel Club which all those showing the dogs have to adhere to. Thats basically covers everything about the dog. “I judged the female Staffordshire Bulls in the World show in Brno which had a total of ninety-nine entrants. “You had dferent classes as well such as Intermediate, Junior class, Open class and winners get a ticket towards an International Beauty title show – of which a dog needs three.” Fred knows what is required for a dog to win a competition having showed dogs himself at the highest level.  Fred Jones with his legendary champion dog, Lackyle Diabhal Og in  He added: “I have showed dogs myself in both Ireland and the UK extensively. There was a dog, named Lackyle Diabhal Og, that I owned that became UK, Irish and International champion. “Hes sadly no longer with us. He was a very famous dog – he produced more champions than any other Stafford in the history of breeding in Ireland. He was also top Terrier stud dog in the UK in . “Two years ago, I showed the grandson of that dog, named Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, which somebody in Scotland owns and he became a champion. He won a Reserve CCat Crufts. “I bought my first Staffordshire bull terrier as a school boy in . I joined my local Staffordshire bull terrier club in  I first became secretary of the club in  held many positions since then including secretary for the second time for the last ten years. “My first judging appointment was in  my first overseas appointment was the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club of Queensland Australia in . “I have now judged my breed on twenty eight occasions in twelve countries, nineteen of these were breed club appointed shows and I also awarded CACIBin Italy in .”  Fred with Lackyles grandson, Caymenstaffs Blackthorn, who was one of the winners at Crufts in  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Mr Colhoun, who lives at Somme Park near Altnagelvin, scooped the prize – awarded by Clanmil Housing Group – for his and the rest of his six-strong gardening teams work on the housing schemes garden. The annual Clanmil in Bloom competition highlights the hard work that goes into making the gardens at Clanmil housing schemes look pristine. googletag.cmd.push It recognises people who take a keen interest in keeping the green spaces around their homes looking the very best they can and gives green-fingered tenants a chance to showcase their handiwork. Mr Colhoun, a tenant at Somme Park, was presented with his award by Paul Fiddaman, Chair of Clanmil Housing, at a special celebration at The Clayton Hotel in Belfast. John is one of a team of six keen gardeners who tend the Somme Park site. He described accepting the award on their behalf as “a great privilege.” He said: “We love watching Monty Don on Gardener’s World and the Cha Flower Show to get tips and ideas – like planting strips of wildflowers instead of having all grass. Our fuchsia is doing very well this year.” As well as growing flowers at Somme Park, the gardeners have also created raised beds where they grow vegetables and have created pathways to make them wheelchair accessible for other tenants. John added: “We have peas, potatoes, gooseberries, red currants, courgettes and peppers.” “We even had a vine growing, but the wee birds and robins ate all the grapes.” John, who used to be a beekeeper, has always had an interest in gardening. He described how important getting out into the garden was to him during the lockdown.     He continued: “I find gardening very therapeutic, and it is a social thing too. The lockdown was a real hard time, and it was important to get to know your neighbours and check in with them to seethey were OK. “At Somme Park everyone looks out for each other, and we all have a bit of craic now in the common room.” Claire Darby, Senior Engagement Officer said, People who live in Clanmil homes love spending time in their gardens and many people across our schemes have spent a lot of time during lockdown in their outside spaces. “The Clanmil in Bloom awards event allows us to celebrate all their achievements and to recognise the great work they have done towards creating that special outdoor place.” Clare McCarty, Group Chief Executive at Clanmil, added: “Credit is due to all the participants, the judges and to Greentown Environmental – our grounds maintenance contractors – who helped sponsor the competition. “The pride and passion that Clanmil people have for their homes and neighbourhoods is clear to see. “Congratulations to everyone who took part, and especially to all the winners.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

Acting through their solicitor, the Montagu Estate have issued a statement expressing regret that Portstewart Town Hall had been subject to years of neglect during its time under the control of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council. googletag.cmd.push The town hall sits on a number of sites provided by the Montagu Estate to the Portstewart townspeople, and the family have said much of the land had been abandoned by those responsible for it. Ever since John Cromie named Portstewart in  he and his successors, now the Montagu Estate, provided lands for specic amenities for the townspeople of Portstewart, they said. This seems to have been forgotten over the years. Our predecessors provided the Cromie Institute, land for the Warren Playing Fields, the Primary School, the Headland, the Crescent foreshore, the Harbour and other many other parcels of land some of which are now in dispute as they have been abandoned by those to whom they had been endowed. It is disappointing to us that the Town Hall has been allowed to fall into disrepair over so many years of neglect, causing the loss of this amenity to the townspeople of Portstewart that is sincerely felt by all. Independent councillor for the area, Angela Mulholland, said the community had reached out to the Montagu estate to attempt to find a solution.     The people of Portstewart are devastated at the prospect of losing our town hall, she said. We fully appreciate and share the disappointment and frustration felt by the Montagu family regarding Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils stewardship of the town hall. We,too, feelthattheCouncilhave notservedasgoodcustodiansofPortstewarttownhall,or asgoodpublicservantsof thecommunityofPortstewart.

Wewanttorally thecommunitytoactively engageinrestoringourtown hallandtheotherareasthat have been left neglected for so long. When contacted, Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council said they intended to issue a statement on the town hall next week. After the Special Council meeting where they approved the hand over after seeking legal advice, Mayor Richard Holmes said the community were free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. ”The ownership of Portstewart Town Hall has been under detailed consideration by Council for over two years,” he said. “In March , the Council made a decision which was not challenged using any of the normal channels, either call-in or rescinding motion. “That decision was to acknowledge the Montagu Estate’s Notice to Quit and the nub of the issue here is the ownership of the building. “While the council is progressing with the hand back of the building, the community is free to negotiate with the Montagu Estate. “Preliminary work to establish the need for community space in Portstewart has already begun as proposed by council members.  Council accused of failing to do due diligence over town hall handover  A local community association has called on the Department for Communities to intervene.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof.

Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  National NewsEuromillions jackpot won in Ireland while record €,, rolls over to Saturday overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnWATCH: Heres the line-up of guests for tonights Graham Norton Show on BBC One overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday,  October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Colm Cusack cutting the cake to celebrate his retirement from Destined.

He is currently renovating a studio on his family land in Donegal, Ireland. He exhibits nationally and internationally, showing at the Dublin Castle, The London Art Fair and the Saatchi Gallery with Cynthia Corbett and the Young Masters Art Prize, the Victoria, and Albert Museum “What is Luxury” with Unknown Fields Division and Toby Smith. Other shows include “GLOBALE: Infosphere” ZKM Museum, Karlsruhe, Germany and Van Abbe-museum, Eindhoven.

He also has a solo show in Dec-Jan at Stallan-Brand Gallery in Glasgow  Kevin completed a residency at The Irish Culture Centre in Paris in August . Are We Here , a site-based, .-meter-tall sculpture by Kevin Callaghan commissioned by Sky Arts on the occasion of the new series Landmark, explores the notion of utopia and our proximity to it      With an ongoing interest in geometry and the potential for multiple realities, Callaghan invites viewers into a future-minded meditation on hope and potentiality via Are We Here. “Are we here ” It’s a question that suggests we are on a journey, and, in addition to hunger for our destination, conjures hope—hope for real freedom and space to realize our multitude of potentialities. If “here” is not yet utopia, it is at least a space where we might imagine, hope for, and build our future. What local music are you into  “Jonny Delaney, Ryan Vail, Orla, And I got a listen To Kwa Daniels’ new radio show on my way to Belfast airport flying back to Glasgow” Inna Rhythm Apart from the obvious, how have you spent lockdown  “When lockdown started my plans to be in Paris on a residency had clearly changed so I began to work extensively on my brand Condie, so that kept me busy for the first lockdown, The second lockdown was crazy busy, after sky arts asked me to apply for the series Landmark, I was one of  in the UK and Ireland commissioned by them, I set about designing the piece Are We Here with my designer. The built-up to the making of the piece in April was intense, then the piece was made in  days from start to finish with the help of the fabricators Sculpture and Design in Glasgow. there was a slower period in May and June then I was finally off to Paris in July”. What groups or services have helped you  “I have had dferent support over the years, the arts council of Ireland, Business to Arts in Dublin, The Crafts Council of Ireland, The National Sculpture Factory in Cork, Donegal Council, and enterprise board to name a few. Its away a nice feeling to support locally”. How do you feel things will change for musicians in the coming year  “It’s been a really tough time for musicians the last  months. I think it’s still going to be a bit slow for artists to get their regular gigs coming back, but I would hope there will be some great new material coming out, from the complex time you all have just had. And I hope that the younger generation of musicians continue to make and put music out and dont get disheartened by the pandemic”. What are your long-term plans  “My long-term plans are to continue making work for exhibitions and larger commission work. I have been doing it since my time studying in Derry  and I dont intend to stop any time soon. I still like to do a residency somewhere every year, I really want to do one again in China, however, le is pretty busy. I am currently renovating a sheep shed in Barnesmore, Donegal in a new studio on the family land and we plan to develop a Bothy style Glamping site on the land in the near future”.

A source close to the country star has said It becomes a big story for Garthhe gets the five nights at Croke Park he was denied before. Three nights won’t be enough. googletag.cmd.push He wants his full five shows at leasthe is ever toto Ireland. Hundreds of residents in the Croke Park area met beside the venue last week with stadium management and Aiken Promotions with concerns over the amount of concerts being planned. Residents are outraged that there could be seven potential concerts held next year and it could go to the High Court, but Dublin City Council could still refuse as they did back in . As it stands under restrictions, only three gigs can take place in Croke Park in a calendar year between January and February. As there has not been a live show in Croke Park since July , Aiken Promotions have been hoping that this would allow them room to negotiate for more gigs in . Garth Brooks May Move Gigs To Aviva If  Croker Nights Falls Through - https:t.co JfNXSWs pic qjsWujjA — Radio Nova  October ,     Pending this decision, insiders say that Brooks is willing to move some of his shows to the Aviva Stadium,hes request for five nights at Croker is denied. “But Garth could do three nights in Croke Park then another three concerts in the Aviva Stadium”,the source continued.     “He could do what Ed Sheeran did in  and add in even more concerts around the regions. This is also causing issues as Sheeran himself has booked two concerts in April . Research has shown that each Brooks gig could possibly generate €million to the local economy. Another study also showed that one concert ticket sold for a Brooks concert would provide € spent in the local area. “They remained steadfast before, and there’s no reason to think they’ll cave in to Garth this time”. “DCC are more into bicycles than heavy lorries so it doesn’t take much imagination to get their view on a fleet of heavy artics rolling in and out of Croke Park for an unprecedented numbers of concerts, added the source. The country singeris already pencilled in to perform in Croke Park for September ,  and  in .Applications have already been lodged to get two extra dates added to this.

This is not acceptable as it prevents new homes from being built in the area, Cllr Mason continued.ldquoThere are many developers looking to invest in both areas to build more affordable homes that locals can rent or buy and raise their families and expand the community as a whole. However, due to the current wastewater system and the failings of NI Water to upgrade it, developers have not been able to build homes.She said there was ldquono doubt that those living in rural areas experience greater dficulty in accessing affordable homes due to house and land prices, land availability and rates of development.She continued: ldquoFollowing the Covid- pandemic, which has resulted in a greater demand for social and affordable housing, it is vital that we see a fully transformative plan for all stakeholders mdash including the Housing Executive mdash to meet the needs of our rural communities.ldquoAfter the publication of the Housing Executiversquos annual housing investment plan for , it is evident that there is still a huge amount of work to do to deliver social and affordable homes across the district.Cllr Mason said she was confident that achieving an increase in the construction of new and affordable social housing will benefit from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyrsquos proposed reforms of the Housing Executive which will allow the organisation to borrow from the market to begin the construction of new social houses for the first time in years.ldquoThroughout the year, site identication studies were carried out by the Executive for Ardglass, Killough, Crossgar, Saintfield and a number of other areas throughout the district.

Further stages of the consultation process with EA are currently underway.ldquoThe school currently has  pupils with capacity in neighbouring catholic maintained schools to support the continued provision for the pupils should the Minister approve the closure.It says St Maryrsquos is operating with five year groups in a single composite class and a further year group in two other classrooms.Over the past five years, the schoolrsquos enrolment numbers have fluctuated between  and .The EA say these statistics show no indication that numbers will increase to  pupils required by Department of Education Sustainable Schools Policy for rural schools.However, while the schoolrsquos governors, staff and parents s were informed of the closure proposal last spring, a statement issued by the school yesterday indicated they opposed the closure.It read: ldquoGovernors and parents have a great confidence in the educational provision that St Maryrsquos provides for our children.ldquoOur most recent ETIreport found education at St Maryrsquos to be of a good standard and our pastoral care has always been outstanding.ldquoSt Maryrsquos is an innovative school with new sensory and nurture rooms. These additional resources enhance the excellent education provision on offer to pupils. ldquoThe school community takes great pride nurturing our pupilsrsquo talents and interests and we will continue to do so. ldquoGovernors and staff are of the view that our school is a vital part of the Saintfield community and we are continuing with efforts to see that it will remain so for future generations.The EA said in its report it investigated other options, such as becoming a shared or integrated education and amalgamation with other schools, but concluded that closure was recommended as there was no evidence ldquoany other option considered could provide sustainable provision.It added: ldquoCCMS recognises the commitment of the governors and staff but the current challenging circumstances do not provide for a sustainable school.ldquoIt is recognised that despite the schoolrsquos best efforts, it continues to face sustainability challenges.

However, before any decision is made about the way forward, the council is keen to hear what the business community has to say.It was revealed last week that there are  empty shop units across the town, with Cllr Curran expressing ldquoconcern at the high number, explaining that as part of the consultation, every business in the town is being asked for its view on what measures could be taken to support its continued regeneration and to attract new investment and shoppers.The global pandemic hit a number of local businesses hard and while there are some politicians in favour of appointing a town centre manager to work in Downpatrick, others believe that the county town should not be given preferential treatment.Cllr Curran said whatever plan is devised to boost the townrsquos economic fortunes, it must have the support of the business community.ldquoI am appealing to businesses when they get the consultation letter from the council to respond and make their voice count, he continued.ldquoThis is a vitally important exercise and it is crucial that we get it right. We currently have too many empty businesses and this is an issue that we need to address.

Other towns which have vibrant tradersrsquo bodies or town centre managers have previously done well and I want to see Downpatrick included on this list.As ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran said the current consultation with traders could not be more timely.ldquoThere is a need to provide a direct link between the business community, statutory organisations, a raft of government departments, key funders and the local authority and someone to oversee future development proposals, he continued.Cllr Curran said the Irish Street regeneration scheme could create new jobs and act as a catalyst for additional investment, explaining that in the short term, any help which existing businesses can be provided with will be more than welcome.He has also welcomed a pound, revitalisation scheme Church Street and hoped that a planned review of traffic light timings in the town centre could go some way towards helping ease congestion at peak periods.He added: ldquoI believe that the economic revitalisation of Downpatrick depends on a key link between the business community, local authority and others.

Half-time: Dromara - Drumaness -.At the start of the second half Quinn Armstrong scored a deserved point before the brave Conall OrsquoHare in the Dromara goal pulled off a crucial interception to deny Drumaness a certain goal.Try as they would, Dromara could not curb their rampant opponents. Niall Flanagan added to his tally with a couple more points and Ben Cassidy struck a good score.Conor Armstrong added a free and minutes later Jake Madine wriggled his way through a number of defenders and smashed the ball to the net.Before the water break Joe McAllister and Conor Armstrong exchanged great long range points but the destiny of the Shield was now beyond doubt with Drumaness leading by  points.In the final quarter, Dromara half forwards Sean McEvoy and Rory Gilmore continued to work hard, as did front men James Gould, Eddie Maguire and Rhys Ewing but try as they did Dromara couldnrsquot break down the tight Drumaness rearguard.At the other end of the pitch no one could stop the outstanding Conor Armstrong. He sailed through the Dromara defence once again to net another fine goal and assisted in a further goal scored by Joe OrsquoHagan.It was fitting that Armstrong completed the Drumaness scoring by adding a further three points to his unbelievable tally before the final whistle sounded.Dromara played well in patches in this game and will rue some of the early chances they missed.They will look back on a great campaign this season with most of their team available next year.They also won the U- County Feile in the summer and the management team deserve great credit for everything this team has achieved.Drumaness were excellent throughout the match and their physicality and fast movement proved too much for this young Dromara side.Drumanessrsquos Conor Armstrong produced a man of the match performance that was absolutely exceptional and would grace any final. He had a personal tally of -, all of which were scores of the highest quality.Drumaness and Down have a real star of the future in their ranks.

I see the tourists who visit Hard Yard every day and they remind me just how special it is. I think all of the students here have a great awareness of the university and its history, the great people who have walked through these gates, but also our professors and how incredible there are. We realise that not only are we being taught by some of the greatest minds in their field but also in the world.He intends to share his excitement and his awe of the university with others.ldquoI was lucky enough to visit Hard four years ago and I was completely struck by the place, he said. ldquoI never thought I would get in and I want to give that experience for any prospective students coming to visit.ldquoWhen I see young people out with their families, I always offer to take photographs of them as I think itrsquos really important to show them thatI, a wee boy from Ireland, can get in, then so can they.As one of the , new intake students this year, the  year-old is indeed walking in the footsteps of impressive former students. Eight former American presidents studied there, including John F Kennedy, George W Bush and Barack Obama, along with leaders from all aspects of le, such as the politician and diplomat Henry Kissinger, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the poet TS Elliot, actors such as Matt Damon and Tommy Lee Jones and a host of Nobel and Pulitzer prizewinners.He lives in a building on the corner of the iconic Hard Yard mdash the universityrsquos historic centre thoroughfare mdash where President Obamarsquos daughter, Malia, and actress Natalie Portman once stayed as undergraduates.Cormac brings a lot to the Hard table as well. Along with getting involved with youth politics and speaking at a debate in the House of Commons, he is a determined campaigner on social issues.In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic last year, Cormac helped to establish the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union of Northern Ireland , the first of its kind here, and was also central to getting former Education Minister Peter Weir to do a U-turn on A-Level grades after last yearrsquos controversial algorithm was used to determine grades in .He was made honorary president of the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union at the same time as studying for his A-Levels and also fulfilling duties as the Member of UK Youth Parliament for South Down.He explained: ldquoI had to submit to an entirely dferent application process to that of UCASand applied quite early, having to have it done by November  last year.ldquoI had to write two essays, one about being from Northern Ireland and how it impacted on my identity as a person, and the second was about me founding the Secondary Studentsrsquo Union and running our first campaign while working over the summer cleaning the toilets at Tyrella Beach.ldquoI also had to submit my academic record while writing ious mini essays and had weeks of essay writing and redrafting and redefining my work to ensure that I was putting my best foot forward.ldquoThe best thing about having to make the deadline in November was that I found out that I had an unconditional offer by mid-December so the pressure was totally off me when it came to waiting on results day in August. I was in a lucky position that I already had my flight booked for Boston  days after that.Believed to be the only lsquoRed Highrsquo student to have attended Hard, Cormac is the son of Gina and Stephen Savage.

There was a huge collective sigh of relief on Sunday in both Belfast and London as they finally got the chance to prove to the world that they were ready for the . mile challenge.In normal circumstances some have managed to do both London and Belfast in the same year as they are often back to back in April and May, but with both races scheduled for the same date that was not possible.The Belfast race started at Stormont Estate and finished at Ormeau Park with a route that took in many areas of the city, including a few unwelcome hills.The day dawned bright and fresh and at times there was heat in the sun. The odd light shower which cooled the runners was welcome at first but as the day went on it became a more persistent mizzle.The underlying issue was the stf breeze and whether it was a head or tail wind depending on the direction of travel. Undeterred the runners ran through whatever was thrown at them and most finished with a smile on their face.Gordy Graham does not shy away from laying his cards on the table.

Obviously with the pandemic that was not to be.He kept on training as consistently as ever and in May at the Championchip Marathon at Down Royal he managed to shave a few seconds off the London time ndash despite a lack of crowds and the fact that it was run on a lapped circuit.He had by then got over the disappointment of realising that due to an admin error his London entry was not carried over to this year.In true trooper form he decided that it would have to be Belfast for his attempt to better his time.He ran a very good half marathon in Larne in August , which was the confidence boost that he needed and when he lined up in Stormont on Sunday, he was full of intent.He managed to latch on to a group for the early part but as the runners stretched out he was forced to run many miles solo which is never ideal.He admits that he hit a low on the Boucher Road when his pacing was skewed by the wind and the gradient, but he rallied to run a strong second half.He was euphoric when he crossed the line in .. He had cut his previous best by four minutes and placed th overall.There is a strong possibility that this is the EDAC marathon record and research is underway to confirm. For those who like statistics, his average pace was five minutes  per mile.Many of us would struggle to run one mile at that speed let alone . of them. A fantastic performance which is so well deserved.Anyone who knows him, knows that he has an admirable work ethic fitting his heavy training regime round his work and his family.After the race, he paid tribute to his coach Ryan Maxwell for keeping him on target in the run up to the event. Some would say ldquohave a well earned rest, but that would be a waste of breath.ldquoEnjoy the buzz would be a more helpful comment followed by ldquoWhatrsquos next Behind Gordy, but also pleased with his performance, was Declan Teague. He was out to complete his th marathon only a couple of weeks after the Causeway Marathon.It was a last minute decision to run and as soon as he decided he would go for it, he was afflicted with a niggle in his hip and leg almost asit was warning him off.He typically chose to ignore the omen and was glad that he did so as number  is now in the bag.He scored another sub .and it keeps him ticking over until the next one. He hopes to take part in Kildare Marathon in a fortnight mdash there is no rest for this man.Clare Carson and Kevin Kelly had signed up for this race on the original date and clocked many miles in their convoluted preparation.Clare in particular has featured in the EDAC news for some of her crazy exploits involving ultra distances.

She was a great representative of the club and made full use of the opportunity.Phillip Vint has completed the London Marathon many times and yet he would still say that each time is special.This year it was all the more so with the enforced layoff from competition due to restrictions.

Super work, Hannah.Deo Kato works and lives in London so there was no way he was going to miss out.This was not his first marathon but it was his first in London and even though he sees the sights on a daily basis, he was blown away by the experience of running on the closed roads of the city and the support of the cheering crowds. He hopes that this will be something that he repeats next year.Wendy Findlay set off to the remote location of Loch Ness for her marathon. She loved the pipers and the Baxterrsquos soup at the finish but the monster hill at mile  wasnrsquot so welcome.She described the route as undulating but scenic and the weather, as you would expect in Autumn in the highlands, as fresh but damp.The marshals were friendly, reaching the start was easy and all in all she had a great day out.

It could normally cost them pound to hire a skip to dispose of them, said Francie, who estimates he has used  pallets so far.ldquoI once got  sheets of aluminium for pound mdash thatrsquos for nothing to what they would cost new. I like to use things that people might think of being rubbish, or having no other use, but thatrsquos not true at all.Francie is intending that  percent of his boat will be made from recycled materials as he has bought a re-serviced engine and other items for the interior.He has been working six hours a day since last April, making the boat in three separate sections mdash the hull, the mid section and the cabin mdash in his large workshop at home on the Ardglass Road before assembling them outside.ldquoI couldnrsquot wait to get up in the morning to work on it, it was so exciting and great to see the progress and it finally coming together, he said.He has devised an innovative way of creating ballast in the boat by drilling  holes in the hull to allow water in to sink the boat which is then offset by the air pressure inside creating air pockets for the right balance of ballast and float.ldquoItrsquos only an Irishman who would build a boat hull and then drill holes into it, but people will be interested in this method once the boat is on the water, said Francie.A retired woodcutting machinist, Francie can turn his hand to many a trade, and has done so over the years, even building the two-bedroom cottage for him and his we, Patricia.His attention to detail and planning was so thorough that he built a -inch scaled model of the boat in four weeks so that he could see exactly how his design would work in practiceWith the help of friends, he has been videoing his progress on the boat building in order to give other people a detailed instruction on how to do it for themselves.ldquoIrsquove designed the boat to a simple construction so thatanyone knows how to use a hammer and a saw, they will be able to make this as itrsquos all made with butt joints. Therersquos nothing complicated about it,said Francie.ldquoThe whole point of building the boat is show people that it can be done from recycled materials and even though something is made out of what some people might see as rubbish, it can still be done well.His river boat wonrsquot be made for speed, which suits him just fine.He got his first taste of river boating when he and his we hired a cruise boat on the Erne about  years ago.ldquoIt was absolutely beautul and I loved going along at about five miles an hour as you had time to see everything around you.ldquoIt was a bit of a shock than to get back in the car and go then even at mph. I really enjoyed the speed that the river boat goes at.Part of the joy and excitement for Francie working on the boat is knowing what enjoyment his large family of  grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and their parents will have over the years to come.ldquoThe boat should last about - years and we all hope to enjoy it. Itrsquos got to the stage where the family are asking lsquo our boat is readyrsquo yet, he added.Francie and Patricia moved to Downpatrick with four of their children in the early s due to the Troubles in Belfast.He is planning to name the boat The Hockaninny after spending some time on a school trip to Nissan huts in the Dundrum area.ldquoThere must have been about  of us kids staying in these huts in a field at the time, explained Francie.ldquoThere was nothing for us to do other than play on a discarded bunk bed which had only three legs. It became our bus, our boat, our train, anything we could think of to play on and one day one lad named it The Hockaninny.ldquoSo there was this piece of rubbish that gave us endless pleasure and entertainment and I hope the boat will also do it over the years to come..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_francie(1).jpg","title":"Francie comes good  ","story":"SATURDAY saw the climax of Ardglass Golf Clubrsquos th anniversary celebrations, with an open stableford competition sponsored by the AJC Group.The company, which specialises in festive lighting, electrical and event services and retail, has been sponsoring the Ardglass club generously for a number of years and one of the talking points of the day was a magnicent pound, cash prize on offer for a hole-in-one at the par three th.A torrential early morning downpour soaked many of the early starters, but although a strong wind continued to blow, conditions were warm and sunny for the rest of the day for most of the  players.One of the grouprsquos managing directors, Declan Murdock, was on hand to see players set off from early light and was again present that evening to see first prize handed to the eventual winner, who turned out to be none other than his father, Francie.Playing off a five-handicap, Francie was round in a one over par , with three birdies on his card, including one at the th which saw him finish on  points.The runner-up was Conaill Taggart, who was the leader in the clubhouse for about an hour on  points and whose strong back nine included a birdie at the th.In next place was Jack David, in his first competition of the year.

interest them in investing in a major redevelopment of the entire seafront of the town, from the Slieve Donard to Newcastle harbour.A new brochure detailing the councilrsquos plans for the town has been produced and is being circulated to a large number of firms, other funding sources and statutory agencies.Blueprints for the improvement scheme, which has received support from both the council and the Newcastle  group, were revealed last year.The plan consists of three stages mdash from the Downs Road car park to Castle Bridge, between the Newcastle Centre and Pattons Bridge and the third section which involves creating a new promenade to the harbour.The document outlines plans to regenerate Newcastle and make it a top tourist destination.DOWNPATRICK mdash The development of a new multi-screen cinema in Downpatrick would provide the perfect kick-start to a major economic regeneration initiative in the town, it has been claimed.Downpatrick councillor, Peter Craig, who has been one of the driving forces behind the push for a new cinema made his comments three weeks after plans to develop a new cinema at Dunleath Park were abandoned by Down Council.The local authority admitted the ambitious proposal earmarked for land adjacent to the Down Leisure Centre had fallen victim to legal and financial problems.However, it hopes the multi-million pound complex can be developed at an alternative site where in the town centre and be up and running within the next few years.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Firefighters tackled a blaze at a farmyard on the outskirts of Castlewellan last week.The blaze, at Wood Road, was discovered at around .am last Friday when a passing postman alerted the farmer that one of his barns was on fire.Two crews of firemen from Newcastle and a third from Rathfriland were called to the scene and fought the fire in the barn, which contained  round bales of straw.A second adjoining shed, which had  tonnes of silage stored in it, also went on fire and although the first barn was destroyed, the structure of the second was saved.Station officer Nevin Donaghy explained that although no animals or humans were hurt, their efforts at fighting the fire were hampered as the nearest hydrant was over one mile away from the farmyard.CROSSGAR mdash No toys, few clothes and little food ndash local schoolchildren yesterday discovered first hand what

themselves just how dficult le is for people across the world.DRUMANESS mdash Local politicians have this week been accused of portraying a negative image of the district and hampering future inward investment.The damning claim has been made by Rowallane councillor Eddie Rea, who secured a seat on the local authority just over three months ago.Mr Rea believes recent comments by some politicians about the plan to extend the Thales Air Defence base near Drumaness, which employs  people, sends out the message that investors are not welcome in Down District.And he is also concerned about comments by ious politicians about the proposals by mobile telephone companies to extend their ious networks across the district.Although the defence companyrsquos headquarters are in Belfast, the Loughmann base is used as a final assembly plant for its products and Mr Rea said the recent comments about the facility by SDLP councillors Patsy Toman and Margaret Ritchie ldquoportray a negative

the ldquoreal facts of the case.KILLYLEAGH mdash A poundm plan to build over  new homes in Killyleagh has received a major boost from local people.Local planners were last week presented with a

open food hall in Downpatrick as we reported in 2017  ","story":"NEWS that Marks and Spencer has identied Downpatrick as a potential base for a new food store comes over four years after the Down Recorder first broke the story.In March , the paper revealed that MS could be the latest big name arrival in the town and that the High Street retailer had examined a number of potential sites.These included the former Danske bank premises in Market Street, but MS subsequently turned its attention to the former Irish Street police station which is to be redeveloped as part of a major town centre regeneration initiative.In a document published by CBRE, MS has confirmed that it is now seeking out-of-town or edge of town sites to set up food stores of at least , sq ft.Downpatrick is one of seven towns where the leading retailer would like to open new stores, with the others including Antrim, Armagh, Dungannon, Magherafelt, Newtownards and Carrickfergus.The towns are among a long list of areas across the UK where MS believes there is a market for its hugely popular food offering.The company said that it wants ldquoprominent sites on major roads with dedicated parking, adding that it will also consider moving into existing retail units.Currently, the nearest Marks and Spencer stores are at the Sprucefield retail park outside Lisburn and the Forestside complex in south Belfast, with the companyrsquos arrival in Downpatrick viewed as a major vote of confidence in the town.Local politicians say they are pleased that MS has not only retained its interest in Downpatrick, but recognises that locating one of its food stores in the town would be a very successful move.South Down MLA Colin McGrath, Baroness Margaret Ritchie and Downpatrick area councillors Dermot Curran and Gareth Sharvin hope that MSrsquos plans will come to fruition.ldquoThis type of food outlet has a following which would undoubtedly see people travelling to Downpatrick that previously would not have and that extra footfall can help other businesses in the town, he said.ldquoI believe this is a good new story and an indication that Downpatrick is being noticed by retailers as a place to do business and that is also good sign for local people.Mr McGrath is encouraging MS to aim for a location that is as close to the town centre as possible, suggesting the last thing local businesses need is displacement of footfall, confirming that he plans to raise this issue with store executives.Lady Ritchie said that as part of the townrsquos ongoing economic regeneration ldquowhich needs to be driven by a town centre manager, she is pleased that Marks and Spencer has identied seven sites in Northern Ireland for new food stores. ldquoOne of those sites is Downpatrick where the possible location of a food store has been talked about for several years, she continued.ldquoI hope that such a new store comes to fruition and that MS receive every assistance from Newry, Mourne and Down Council in identying the best optimum site which will offer local people a wider food choice as well as helping to pump-prime economic and business regeneration in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran mdash who is seeking a meeting with MS officials mdash said the fact that the retail giantrsquos interest in Downpatrick appeared to be as strong as it was four years ago was good news.He continued: ldquoClearly, MS has done its homework and sees major potential in opening a food store in the town which would signicantly increase footfall and help provide a boost for existing businesses.ldquoA new food store would also create much-needed jobs and hopefully open the door to other big names to take their place alongside the independent and family-owned businesses that we currently have.He added: ldquoFacing into a post-Covid world, the arrival of a major retailer in Downpatrick would provide everyone with a lt. More and more big names in the retail world investing in the town would illustrates their confidence in it and will help kick-start its future growth.Cllr Sharvin, who announced the retail giantrsquos interest in the town last year when he was discussing the area with MS management and letting agents, is urging local council officials to work with the company.ldquoMS has been looking to find an ideal location within the Downpatrick area for some time and needs to be at least , square feet with a good volume of parking outside. This is a great opportunity to boost the local economy within Downpatrick and bring a large number of jobs to the area that are much-needed, he said.Cllr Sharvin has asked the councilrsquos economic, regeneration and tourism department work with MS and its agents in identying a site that will meet the needs of the organisation and has also urge any commercial owners or developers to come forward to work with the organisation to start the process.He added: ldquoThis is too big an opportunity to miss for our town and we must all work together to deliver this..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6October2021_michaela.jpg","title":"Michaela recognised for community work  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK woman who kept residents in the Ballymote area connected during the pandemic has had her efforts recognised by the Housing Executive.Michaela Hannaway was thanked by housing officials as part of their Good Neighbours Make Great Neighbourhoods campaign.During the summer, Housing Executive staff and members of its Housing Community Network nominated tenants who have made a dference in communities all over Northern Ireland.

The versatile Orla Fegan demonstrated excellent support play throughout, escaping the close marking Anne Marie Fegan.Former Drumaness player Julie Brown played strongly at full back, but the excellent pressure from Carville, Gordon and Fitzimons ensured that Dromararsquos play never found the same rhythm that it did in previous league meetings.Jade Casement was colossal at the back, time and again making crucial interceptions, before off loading to Ferris and Noade.Aisling McClements, Edel Kearney, Laura and Kerri Madine all competed well when introduced, but it was stalwart Sharon Taylorrsquos sublime finish to the top corner of the net that drew the loudest applause.Fittingly, it was Gordon who created the opportunity for Taylor, who displayed her reservoirs of experience to cooly slot home from a narrow angle.The embrace from her team mates afterwards demonstrated the growing camaraderie and togetherness amongst the group.The importance of Taylor and Gordonrsquos contribution cannot be understated, providing priceless experience and ensuring that the strong tradition and legacy that Annie Gelston created continues.Other players are rumoured to be potentially coming out of retirement next season, including Annette Gelston.A fine win to build upon and now St Kevinrsquos have a tough fixture against a resolute Kilclief Ben Derg side at Fontenoy Park, Liatroim tomorrow evening at .pm.Former Fontenoy, and current St Kevinrsquos leader Maria Ryan certainly knows Fontenoy Park well and she will be hoping that she can replicate the incredible personal tally of - she scored in this fixture.St Kevinrsquos -Dromara -JUNIOR CAMOGIE CrsquoSHIP.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13089133.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is also likely to call for measures to reduce livestock transportation and for changes in land management, which may impact on the use of slurry.Some farmers, in , believe that not enough attention is given to the ability of their grassland to absorb carbon emissions.Edwin PootsNorthern IrelandClare Bailey  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularNorthern Ireland gospel preachers arrested by Gardai are to go on trial in Republic of Ireland after preaching against homosexuality‘A message to the IRA man who killed my brother: you have wasted your le’Royal Military Police officer has recalled taking a rle from accused veteran Dennis Hutchings, but cannot confirm the weapon was his, a judge has heardHenry McDonald: Colm Toibin spurns misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’Ulster Unionist Conference: Doug Beattie sets UUP sights on first minister job as he insists ‘we are back’Most PopularBen Lowry: Echoes of , as Boris Johnson fails to proclaim his unionism in his keynote speech to ToriesUK Government says it will press head with legislating for Irish language from Westminster‘Unionism is led by gutless careerist amateurs: time for a clear out’VIDEO: Ex Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith says the Northern Ireland Protocol should be replacedTwitter spat between Simon Coveney and Lord Frost over NI Protocol                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Please try again later.Submitting...And yet on reading the actual column Toibin wrote it was evident that the author had not deviated at all from his long time pluralistic, scrupulously fair and nuanced take on Northern Ireland.He started out by referencing the Queen and her historic, ground-breaking visit to the Republic back in . The novelist recalled talking to British diplomats a few months before she would arrive in Dublin. He remembered urging them not to compel herto use one loaded word — ‘sorry’. Toibin reflected in his article that, “The word ‘sorry’ was debased. Everyone was always sorry. Very few people who said they were sorry really meant it. Nor should the Queen express remorse or apology. The Queen in Ireland should not say anything that she did not mean.”Staying focussed on the Queen’s visit Toibin continued: “On  May  the Queen spoke with great delicacy and tact in Dublin Castle. She did not apologise for anything. She merely said something that happens to be true: ‘With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done dferently or not at all’.”Courageously, Toibin also challenged the cosy consensus in the Irish media that Brexit had somehow completely changed the matrices of relationships between Irish and British people, which appeared to reach such a positive apex during the royal visit to Ireland.“None of this was ever going to change after Brexit. Irish soccer fans will still support English teams Irish people still have cousins in England and go to England looking for work Northern Irish people will still see Scotland as close to home. England still represents freedom for many Irish people,” Toibin wrote.Excoriating not only Sinn Fein but also those politicians in Ireland’s traditionally dominant parties, Toibin warned against them wrapping the Green Flag around their torsos in order to harvest support from a younger, more neo-nationalist population south of the border.“Their talk of a united Ireland ‘in my letime’ is mystical blather, but it has the power to unsettle a fragile political environment. Also, it will do nothing to keep Sinn Féin at bay. “It will do nothing either to solve the more pressing and immediate problem of sour relations at official level between Ireland and Britain after Brexit. It is another example of politicians saying something they don’t mean.”In his column Toibin too recollected his visits to Protestant churches where funerals of murder victims took place in the IRA killing fields of Fermanagh during the Troubles. He reminded readers about the deep wounds inflicted upon border unionist communities during those dark days. His moving testimony, a powerful echo of his superb book about walking those borderlands in the s, was a welcome balm to all the waspish, stinging anti-Brit rhetoric that has infected southern Irish public discourse over the last few years.The novelist even had the guts to raise awkward questions such as why people in Northern Ireland would give up an NHS that is free albeit flawed to one that in his words is a “dysal health system” down south.Colm Toibin’s column was a welcome, realistic, refreshing intervention amidst all the misty-eyed guff about a ‘New Ireland’ in the post-Brexit era. It demonstrates that there are still voices in the Republic who maintain a sensible, pragmatic, nuanced outlook about Northern Ireland and especially towards the people there that still prefer to be part of the UK.His column originally in  was headline-neutral: ‘Will the Brexit fall out lead to a United Ireland ’, the paper asked.Toibin was at the very least sceptical about that prospect at present although you would never have known thatyou took The  headline over the same text as an indication of what the author was actually trying to say. Which begs more questions about the state of The  these days and its apparent abandonment of pluralism in both the states of Ireland.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They seem to have abandoned principles that were once the bedrock of the party, and have no conscience about it.More worrying, their members have bought into it.They are courting popularity, and in a world that has become increasingly secular this will earn its nod of approval, but that comes at a price!If you sell your soul, the devil always collects.Public opinion can be fickle!No doubt in the run up to the election they will resort to the old vote catcher: “vote to keep the other side out”.

While some of this has been the consequence of some political commentators not actually reading the invitation, others have been engaged in deliberately misleading the public.In particular, Fianna Fail TD Cathal Crowe’s statement on Clare Byrne’s RTE radio program on Thursday in tandem with statements from Sinn Fein TD’s were inaccurate.

It says and I quote: “The service will provide the opportunity for honest reflection on the past one hundred years, with the acknowledgment of failures and hurts, but also with a clear affirmation of our shared commitment to building a future marked by peace, reconciliation, and a commitment to the common good. The overriding theme will be that of ‘Hope’.”How can anyone claim that these words describe the event as a “commemoration”.It is therefore totally appropriate that we should participate in this ecumenical service.John Cushnahan, Ex Alliance Party leader and Fine Gael MEP, Co Limerick——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Many countries worldwide have been partitioned and do not see a need for commemorations. They accept partition and live in the present.However, by refusing to attend the Armagh event, President Higgins seems to show a lack of acceptance of the wishes of Northern unionists to remain in the UK.

Protestants and Catholics in Southern Ireland with unionist backgrounds left an Anglophobic state in large numbers since independence and those who remained ‘were, or seemed to be, enervated’ by the majority, as the late Provost of Trinity College, FSL Lyons, wrote in Culture and Anarchy in Ireland.

There can also be pus and some may have the condition for weeks or even months.What are chilblains and how does this dfer from Covid toes Chilblains are small, itchy, red patches that can appear after you have been in the cold.Chilblains usually appear a few hours after you have been in the cold and you mostly get them on your fingers and toes, but can also get them on your face and legs.They usually clear up on their own in two to three weeks, but you may need to see a GPthey do not go away.What causes Covid toes A new study - published in the British Journal of Dermatology - has found that Covid toes could be a side effect of the immune systemrsquos response to coronavirusResearchers behind the study examined  participants with Covid toes and  with similar chilblains lesions that arose before the pandemic.The study found that one mechanism behind both types of the condition involved the body generating an immune response with high levels of certain autoantibodies, which mistakenly target and react with a personrsquos own cells and tissues as well as the invading virus.     Researchers also found an overlap with type I interferon, which is a key protein in the antiviral response.Cells lining blood vessels which supply the affected areas also appeared to play a critical role in the development of Covid toes and chilblains.Senior author of the study, Dr Charles Cassius, said the research provided a deeper understanding of the condition.He said: ldquoThe epidemiology and clinical features of chilblain-like lesions have been extensively studied and published, however, little is known about the pathophysiology involved.ldquoOur study provides new insights. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Councillor Sam Nicholson.Businesses providing separatetoilets for male, female, disabled and baby changing receivea higher fee than those offering just one unisex toilet.The matter was originally tentativelydiscussed by the environmental services committee in November and December  before ing to the agenda in August  with an updated report on the matter presented to members of the committee on Tuesday, October .The community toilet scheme was initially considered as a way to deal with any potential shortfall in public toilet facilities in Portadown, however, the report notes the toilet facilities in Portadown ’s building on William Street are now operational and are under contract until April .With regards to a pilot for the scheme, the report suggests Lurgan and Portadown as two suitable areas.At present,Lurgan has four free to use facilities along with  pubs and caféswhile Portadown has eight free to use facilities along with  pubs and cafés.Members were also made aware that Derry City and Strabane Council launched its own Community Toilet Scheme in April  and have  participating businesses.Councillor Sam Nicholson asked businesses had previously expressed interest in the scheme but was advised businesses had never really been approached about the scheme by Council’s head of environmental services, Barry Patience.“It had been brought to committee on a number of occasions to seewe wanted to go to businesses,” said Mr Patience.“The only thing we have done is identy those locations so there is some detail for Portadown and Lurgan as possible sites for a trial.“We have not approached businesses yet. “Members had previously said they would be happy to hear more information about the scheme so this is us bringing that further information back.”Councillor Nicholson said it would be worth “asking the question” to businesses and proposed a workshop to discuss the potential objectives, scope and outcomes of any potential scheme.His proposal was seconded by Alderman Stephen Moutray who said it would be worth “exploring the merit” of this proposal.“This is potentially an opportunity to provide more facilities for people in our town centreswe go ahead with this,” he said.“As long as we are sure this has not already been discussed with businesses then I am happy to second the proposal that this is explored further in a workshop.”Read this:- Halloween back with a bangEditor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
