Their argument is that, since he was appointed in 2017, he’s really put his back into the role and been a very good Colonel.’  Diva Helena is a perfect Princess...Helena Bonham Carter displayed appropriate lèse majesté when The Crown creator Peter Morgan asked her to take over the role of Princess Margaret.‘I said: “Well, I need to see a script.” And he said: “What do you mean?

They noticed a few things about Joseph Henry Loveless\u0027s life didn\u0027t seem to add up. His gravestone was actually a cenotaph, a stone with his name on it but no body buried underneath.Loveless\u0027s second wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, was killed with an ax on May 5, 1916, by a man named Walt Cairns, according to news articles and a wanted poster created by local law enforcement at the time.But according to another local news article on Agnes\u0027 funeral, one of her children said that it was his father in jail for the murder, not Walt Cairns. The child also remarked that his dad would be escaping soon because he never stayed in jail long.The DNA Doe Project team eventually unraveled the truth: Joseph Henry Loveless was born December 3, 1870, in the Utah Territory to Mormon pioneers. He married twice - his first wife Harriett Jane Savage orced him for \u0027abandonment,\u0027 according to Salt Lake City court records - and became a bootlegger, counterfeiter and general outlaw in Idaho.         Loveless\u0027s second wife, Agnes Octavia Caldwell Loveless, was killed with an ax on May 5, 1916Loveless used a variety of aliases during his criminal career, including Walt Cairns, Charles Smith and other variations of his given and phony names. He was also notorious for escaping custody, Bingham Redgrave said, sawing through jail bars with a blade he kept in his shoe and once managing to stop a moving train that he was being transported on to flee law enforcement.Investigators believe he died shortly after he escaped from the St. Anthony jail on May 18, 1916, where he was being held for Agnes\u0027 murder.\u0027It\u0027s blown everyone\u0027s minds,\u0027 Bingham Redgrave said of the investigation. \u0027The really cool thing, though, is that his wanted poster from his last escape is described as wearing the same clothing that he was found in, so that leads us to put his death date at likely 1916.\u0027Loveless\u0027 descendants were unaware of their ancestor\u0027s sordid past, so at this point there\u0027s not much more to go on besides speculation when it comes to the identity of Loveless\u0027 murderer.Still, with the Clark County Sheriff\u0027s Office keeping the case open as a homicide investigation, more clues may turn up yet.\u0027Who knows? Someone might recognize that name and say, `Oh, let me look at the old family photos.´ Someone may find something, an old news story, that isn\u0027t digitized,\u0027 Bingham Redgrave said. \u0027I\u0027m really excited to see what else comes out.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Up 4 000 troops ordered prepare rapid deployment Middle East","story":"Share this articleRudaw English on

That will bring more unsettled weather to northern and western Scotland, but much drier conditions further south.\u0027Occasionally the jet stream will dip across the UK, bringing colder weather to northern parts and a bit more rainfall further south, but on the whole high pressure looks likely to dominate across much of Europe and southern parts of Britain.\u0027Today will be mostly dry, grey and cloudy in the morning but there will be bright spells in northern and eastern Scotland and coastal North East England.

Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888 and gained notoriety as a poet early in life. He was only 26 when \u0027The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\u0027 became his first professionally published poem.His best known works include \u0027The Waste Land,\u0027 \u0027The Hollow Men\u0027 and \u0027Four Quartets.\u0027The first poem in the \u0027Quartets\u0027 series, called \u0027Burnt Norton,\u0027 piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse. The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in 1934.\u0027His relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and it\u0027s a door he chose not to open,\u0027 she said.       Letters between poet T.S. Eliot and longtime confidante Emily Hale are displayed in Princeton, N.J. Thursday. From January 2 students, researchers and scholars can go to the Ivy League school in New Jersey to see these letters that many are saying may reveal more intimate details about Eliot\u0027s life and workThe letters could also reveal details about Eliot\u0027s conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, Dickey says.Dickey, who served as one of the editors on \u0027The Complete Prose of T.S.

I was gathering schoolbooks when something caught my eye: lettuce leaves, lying on the carpet. Perfect! I thought, scooping them up and packing them. Now I won’t be hungry at university next year! I woke still glowing with pride.Since that dream, I’ve been thinking about how neatly education arranges life into endings and beginnings. You finish one segment, take a summer holiday, and step into the next – nervous, excited – and equipped, if you have my sort of foresight, with a handful of rotting lettuce leaves. But grownup life is more chaotic. There are plenty of potential beginnings – jobs, partners, dietary changes, but nobody has drawn up a schedule. Changes tend to be flung at you, or depend on your own efforts.In my novel Gravity Is the Thing, changes are both flung at and chosen by Abigail, owner-manager of the Happiness Cafe. Back when she was a teenager, Abigail’s brother vanished. Around the same time, she started receiving chapters in the mail from a self-help book called The Guidebook. Now, 20 years later, she’s invited to a retreat to learn “the truth” about The Guidebook.The absence of Abigail’s brother is central to her story. A missing loved one is a particularly traumatic loss because it isn’t entirely a loss. At any moment, the person could reappear. There’s no ending, so there can’t be a new beginning: life without the loved one cannot start. In Gravity, I wanted to explore the promises of the self-help industry in this context of ambiguous loss: much like hope, self-help can be both transformative and destructive.At first, the idea of choosing 10 books about new beginnings alarmed me. I couldn’t think of any. Then I realised that all novels have at least one crisis, discovery or transformation, and each of these triggers new beginnings. Essentially, then, this is a list of books that have been special to me (not the most special, those would be the books of my sisters, Liane and Nicola) or that have shaped me as a writer or person, angled to catch the light.1. Cocaine Blues by Kerry GreenwoodPhryne Fisher, sexy, sassy and newly arrived in Melbourne, Australia, decides to become a private detective. This is the first in a series that is pure, witty, intelligent escapism, each book improving on the one before. I read these in the bath, with chocolate, whenever I’m worried or sad, and everything is instantly better.2. Case Histories by Kate AtkinsonIn his own way, Jackson Brodie is just as charismatic, sexy and capable as Phryne Fisher. Case Histories, the first of Brodie’s stories, has him embarking on his new career as private detective. I read this many years ago, on a train between Toronto and Montreal, just after a miscarriage, and cried at almost every page. It was exactly what I needed. I already admired Kate Atkinson, but this was when I fell in love with her exuberant, powerful prose.3. In the Mood by Laura BloomSet in Sydney in 1946, In the Mood depicts a young couple attempting to restart their marriage after the husband’s return from war. Bloom’s writing is exquisite, and her meticulous dissection of a relationship frayed by secrets and trauma is reminiscent of Henry James (without the excessive sub-clauses). I’ve always been drawn to novels like this that take the domestic sphere as seriously as it deserves.4. Lenny’s Book of Everything by Karen FoxleeEveryone should read this children’s book set in the 1970s. Lenny’s brother, Davy, was born “six days after Neil Armstrong took his famous step and everyone was still crazy with moon fever”. But Lenny’s mother has a “dark heart feeling” about Davy, a feeling “as big as the sky kept inside a thimble”. Davy begins to grow, and does not stop, and so begin years of doctor and hospital visits, worry and hope. The kindness of neighbours, the distraction of Burrell’s Build-It-at-Home Encyclopaedia, Davy’s winning charm and Lenny’s determination, complete an immersive tale about loss and its transformative powers. It will make you sob.5. Self-Help by Lorrie MooreMost of the stories in this collection explore new beginnings of different kinds: how to become “the other woman”, how to be the child of newly orced parents. In the succinctly titled How, we learn how to start a doomed love affair: “Begin by meeting him in a class, in a bar, at a rummage sale.” Moore’s prose is poetic, sharp and devastatingly funny. Just when you think there’s nothing new to say about relationships, Moore cracks open a fresh layer and confounds you with her insight.6. Chrestomanci by Diana Wynne JonesI usually write for young people so I often read children’s books. My favourites are funny, emotionally authentic and contain practical magic. Wynne Jones’s books, like those of Ellen Raskin and Sally Gardner, make my soul breathe a sigh of relief. The Chrestomanci books are set in parallel worlds to ours, and feature protagonists discovering their magical abilities and setting out to develop them. The charming Christopher Chant appears just in time, offering elegant solutions to seemingly intractable problems.7. Dear Mrs Bird by AJ PearceA comic delight of a tale about friendship and love set against the grim landscape of London during the blitz, this novel sensitively conveys how life, even in tragedy and heartbreak, can be humorous and hopeful. Emmeline Lake accidentally takes a new job typing up letters for an advice columnist at a women’s magazine in London, 1941, which rules an extensive range of subjects out of bounds. Defying her instructions, Emmeline begins to answer them herself.8. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail HoneymanI read this novel on an aeroplane and it made me laugh often and cry more. Eleanor, nearly 30, has been leading a precise, guarded and solitary life, holding herself together through addiction and routine. Then a singer walks on to a stage, and Eleanor falls instantly in love: “He blazed … I sat forward on my seat, edged closer. At last. I’d found him.” A marvel of humour and heartbreak, Eleanor Oliphant reveals how a new friendship can begin to unravel the traumas that are knotted deep within us.9. Dark Emu by Bruce Pascoe A book about new beginnings that stopped my breath and knocked me sideways. This is an eviscerating study of the beginnings of Australian colonialism. It collects compelling evidence that Indigenous Australians were not, as the prevailing historical narrative maintains – and as required by the law of terra nullius – wandering hunter gatherers, but had established both agriculture and dwellings.10. The Waves by Virginia WoolfThis novel opens with a group of children starting out on their life journeys, and has them guide us through to their old age and death in six exquisite, first-person accounts. I read it in high school and it was my first encounter with language so intensely beautiful. It is lyrical, inventive, self-referential and determined to excavate relentlessly in pursuit of truth.• Gravity Is the Thing by Jaclyn Moriarty is published by Allen \u0026amp Unwin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fef51de4360f2b8ddcde08339929f64a62f6ccf/0_349_2571_1542/master/2571.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2920a297cbaa11c0fa5c0ed7204da101","title":"ts eliot intimate letters to confidante emily hale unveiled after 60 years","story":"Collection of 1,131 letters may shed light on poet’s relationship with Emily HaleA collection of more than 1,000 letters from the Nobel laureate TS Eliot to his confidante and muse Emily Hale is unveiled this week, after having been kept in sealed boxes at a US university library for 60 years.The cache promises to offer an intimate insight into the poet’s life and work, and on the extent of his relationship with Hale, a source of speculation for decades.The 1,131 letters, which date from between 1930 and 1956, were donated by Hale to Princeton University Library more than 60 years ago with her stipulation they remain sealed until 50 years after either Eliot’s death, or her own, whichever occurred last. He died in 1965, and she in 1969.The two had met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1912, when Eliot attended Harvard. They rekindled their friendship in 1927, by which time Eliot had moved to England. He corresponded frequently with Hale, who was from Boston, and who taught drama at US universities including Scripps College in California.Eliot ordered Hale’s letters to him to be burned, according to biographers.“I think it’s perhaps the literary event of the decade,” Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the TS Eliot International Summer School, told the Associated Press. “I don’t know of anything more awaited or significant. It’s momentous to have these letters coming out.”Their relationship “must have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication,” he added.Eliot was born in St Louis, Missouri, in 1888. His best known works include The Waste Land, The Hollow Men and Four Quartets.His letters to Hale began after the end of his first marriage to the Cambridge governess Vivienne Haigh-Wood. Scholars point to the first poem in the Quartets series, called Burnt Norton and named after a home in England Eliot visited with Hale, as significant because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been. Eliot married his second wife, Valerie Fletcher, in 1957.The Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, one of the editors on The Complete Prose of TS Eliot, said the poet was ashamed of his first marriage. The letters could reveal how close he and Hale were, and if they ever considered marriage, she said. Whatever else Hale was, she said, she was a link to the life he had left behind in the US.The 12 boxes, which include photographs, ephemera and clippings, were unsealed by Princeton University Library staff in October to be scanned for digital viewing at the library from 2 January.Susan Stewart, a professor of English at Princeton, who was present at the unsealing, said two senior librarians “stood behind a table full of wooden crates wielding dual pairs of tin snips.“They proceeded in tandem to snap the copper bands holding the crates and the wooden slats clattered to the table.”She added that what little was known about the correspondence indicated “Eliot wrote to Hale freely about his predilections, his fellow poets, and above all, his opinions as a reader”.Daniel Linke, the interim head of special collections at the library, said there was minimal, if any reading, during the unsealing. He expected that scholars from around the world would be travelling to Princeton in the first few days.“It will be the special collections equivalent of a stampede at a rock concert,” he told the Associated Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36ae229278c9c94f91f3a651fc5d28467fa23df1/21_11_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3121775f37b26d1ebba036ffc331493c","title":"from jd sports to games workshop best market performers of decade","story":"Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Standard Chartered and BP among the laggards over the past 10 yearsIn the first part of the 2010s, when the billionaire Mike Ashley and his retail creation Sports Direct appeared to be knocking out every opponent that dared to pick a fight, the tycoon gave a memorably bullish performance in front of City analysts.At a presentation in July 2011, as the rival JJB Sports was on the verge of being counted out, Ashley bragged: “I’ll finish off JJB first and then I’ll move on to JD.”History so far shows Ashley’s prediction to be half-right: JJB was carried off on a stretcher in 2012 however, not only did JD Sports decide to take Ashley on, it won easily on points – at least judging by the scorecards of total investor returns at the close of the decade.Partly, this result was down to blows landed on Sports Direct elsewhere, which resulted in Ashley’s firm being relegated from the FTSE 100 in 2016.However, while Sports Direct has struggled, JD Sports has ended the decade as the current FTSE 100 company that has rewarded its investors most over the past 10 years, with £1,000 invested in JD Sports in January 2010 now worth £32,700, thanks to share price rises and idends. It is fair to say that Ashley was not the only one who did not see that coming.In fact, JD Sports, along with eight of the decade’s other top 10 performers who ended 2019 in the FTSE 100, were not even in London’s blue chip index at the beginning of the decade.The flipside of Slater’s point can be seen by studying a separate list of the most valuable shares in the FTSE 100 at the beginning and end of the 2010s.Only two names have dropped out of the list: BG Group, which was acquired by Royal Dutch Shell in 2016, and Vodafone, which in 2014 sold its stake in its American subsidiary Verizon Wireless and then handed the £18bn idend back to shareholders.While Tesco’s bottom-of-the-table performance may have been partially self-inflicted, the company could also point to general sector issues, as the German discounters Aldi and Lidl increased their influence during the decade.Energy stocks also gave investors a miserable 10 years. They were booming as we entered the last decade., with the consensus view that economic growth in China would carry share prices higher still."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/470274c558086852a1d36bdf7ab445235ae6c460/0_81_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b276965aba76aeda2de2227b48aa3160","title":"australia is becoming a nation of dread and the world looks on with pity and scorn","story":"The pattern of bushfires is part of our lives. But these fires are not going outWe know the sight by heart: corrugated iron on a low pile of ash with a chimney left standing. Another house gone. And the pattern of bushfires is part of our lives too. They burn until a cold wind blows up the coast when it buckets down dousing the flames.But that’s not the pattern now. The downpour has been postponed officially until late January. Things are looking up: it was April. Either way the experts are saying the weeks ahead are looking dry, tinder dry.As that news sank in this summer an unfamiliar emotion took hold in Australia: not fear so much as dread. These fires are not going out.We know the language of fires. All our lives we’ve waited to hear a blaze is “under control”. Sweet words. But these days they come with a caveat: only for a few days until the wind shifts and the fire jumps the lines.And the rain never comes.We’re used to seeing the bush growing back quickly, green shoots appearing within days on burnt trunks. Eucalypt forests have amazing regenerative powers. But these fires are tearing through ancient forests that have never burnt before. They are done for. And the burnt gums are waiting for rain.We’re taught not to look at the sun. Every child on earth is given the same warning. But in Australia these days you can stare all you like. Take a good long look at that pink disc sinking in the murk. It can’t do you much harm. It’s been tamed by smoke.The smoke is new too: cities suffocating. We’re used to a day or two in town when there’s a bit of smoke about and the light turns a horrible yellow. That’s every summer. But this is different. Deep in cities, miles from the fire front, the smoke is so thick you can’t see to the end of the street.Yet we’ve never seen so much before. Everyone is a photographer now. And until the transmission towers burn and batteries flatten extraordinary images are making their way to the media. We’re seeing these horrors in all their detail.On the beach at Mallacoota, families sat in the smoke under a sky of flame. It’s all on camera. The scene was repeated up and down the coast. At Malua Bay in New South Wales, children, their parents and grandparents were trapped for a day and night between fires and the sea. They’re safe now but it was a close call.Already, these scenes are part of the national imagination. Among Australians of a certain age, they stir memories of a Hollywood potboiler about the end of the world filmed 60 years ago in Melbourne. On the Beach starred Ava Gardener, Gregory Peck and Fred Astaire. The remake stars us.One of the duties of a leader is to find the words in times like these. So many have died. So much has been destroyed. But how can Scott Morrison speak to the experience of the country if he can’t admit we are living through unique times? He says instead: “We have faced these disasters before.”Watch and act, Prime Minister. Watch and act.If Morrison could face the truth, he might speak not only to his country but the world. If Australia were taking effective action against climate change, this catastrophe would give us the right to demand better of the great rogue states on climate, China and the USA.We’re doing our bit, he says as the country burns and the world looks on with a mix of pity and scorn.For empathy, we turn to the plain speech of fire chiefs as they count the toll, giving long lists day after day of destruction, bravery, death and lucky escape in the face of fires these men and women have never seen before.And on television every night, with looks of professional apology, weathermen and women standing in front of scarlet maps of Australia tell us over and over again the news that makes sense of all these woes: according to the best forecasts, we have at least weeks to wait for rain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/047e03eb9d1385e223b99b550f11dcf871b2c176/0_131_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88a99daa4b1aa3f3d3b3be5cc7788c44","title":"questions labour win party defeat","story":"There can be no quick fixes. The party needs to take time for judgments to settle about its descent into the electoral abyssNearly a month ago Jeremy Corbyn announced he would step down after a period of reflection. This week he offered the first fruits of that process: 2019, Corbyn announced, had been “quite the year for our country and our labour movement”. Nevertheless, he added: “We have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson.”It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry. But Labour is unquestionably going to have to do very much better than this if it is to climb out of the electoral abyss into which Corbyn led it in December. Talking about resistance to Johnson is simply displacement activity. The central truth is that Labour has to make itself the electable alternative that it failed to be in 2019. It needs to have a strategy for power. In the real world, power is hope, not the other way round.This is extremely likely to occur if Labour continues to put the cart before the horse. The leadership election is under way. But the period of reflection has barely started. It needs more time and structure. The costs were obvious this week, when the apparent frontrunner published a manifesto of vacuous generality, which posed no difficult questions and lacked substantive proposals for doing anything differently. On the basis of that article, if Rebecca Long Bailey is the answer, then Labour is asking the wrong question.If it is to be useful, Labour’s period of reflection needs some ground rules it currently lacks. These include: a recognition of the gravity of the situation, an obligation to answer difficult questions, a dispassionate study of the facts, an open-minded approach, a willingness to admit mistakes, the avoidance of slogans, and the willingness to listen to others – who should include Labour’s opponents and (increasingly the same thing) the voters. There is not much sign of any of that yet.The right questions need to be rooted in a balanced and honest appraisal of Labour’s electoral position. And the answers must avoid the habit, which affects all sides in the party, of evading difficult truths by talking about something else. So here are some of the important questions, and my own brief and provisional answers:Was Brexit the main problem? It was one of them, but Labour’s Brexit problem was its longstanding ambiguity, not its pro-European approach. Labour still needs a European policy for the post-Brexit 2020s.So was it Corbyn? The surveys say yes. His ratings were the worst ever for a Labour leader. But the Corbyn programme was not believed either. Competence matters, and Labour had not put in the hard yards on that. Corbyn would have claimed the credit for a win, so he must accept the blame for the defeat.Did Labour win the argument? No, it did not. Some aspects of Labour’s campaign cut through, but not by enough. The election result tells the story: Labour lost. To say otherwise is to be in denial. Too many still are.Was it the media’s fault? No … but. Britain’s media is politically biased and not as good as it thinks it is. It made mistakes in 2019, some of which would have been difficult to avoid. But these get exaggerated. The answer is not a more politicised media but better standards.Would a return to New Labour be the answer? Of course not – 2024 will not be 1994. New Labour must own its failures, just as the Corbynistas must own theirs. But if Labour cannot reconcile its militants and its moderates, it will pay the price. It needs to try.Should Labour be a socialist party? A big question for some, but not the main one for most. It depends what you mean by socialism. Labour ignores aspiration and the desire to do well at its peril. Inidualism and community are not incompatible. It also depends on how much it matters to you to win elections.Is it all over for Labour? No. See above. But Labour has been on a losing streak for a decade. It is now steered by a clique that have run it close to catastrophe, and who should get the boot. After 1992, many asked if Labour could ever win again. It turned out that it could. But this time things could get worse before they get better, and Labour may not win an election for a decade.Should Labour split into a left party and a centre-left party? Not if it hopes to win power in the next 20 years. The traditions need to recognise that each is legitimate.Finally, stop obsessing about the left. Most people are not interested. Think instead about problems, programmes and priorities. And we members of the Amalgamated Union of Commentators, Columnists and Allied Pundits should stop talking about Labour as “us”. Those days are gone. We must watch what happens next and allow judgments time to settle. Millions of people who want a better government and a different kind of society don’t see Labour as the answer, let alone as all-knowing and all-virtuous, for the simple reason that right now it is neither."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0422835507479cb0ac4b284575d3a16e8b944dcd/0_12_5235_3142/master/5235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7378953a2d407e95a6bb0b72c98b9bbd","title":"scoff elf help works simple life advice narcissism","story":"I thought simple life advice was a step towards narcissism – until I started listening to an upbeat California podcastIt started small, like all the most insidious addictions. A moment of indecision over what podcast to listen to next – more Brexit analysis or another gruesome cold case centred on a woman’s corpse? – and I was sucked in. Now, I mainline two or three a day. But at least if the problem becomes unmanageable, someone will have a solution to offer me.For my entire adult life, I have not merely scoffed at but actively militated against the self-help industry. On a macro-level, I resented the simplicity of the solutions on offer, seeing them as capitalist sops designed to winkle out their victims’ weaknesses and create a cycle of cash-rich dependency. On a personal level, they offended my carefully nurtured, aggressively deployed intellectual defences where I would bring Proust, they brought a Hallmark card. How stupid did people have to be to sign up to their vacuous bullshit?But life moves on. It was a chance exchange on Twitter that began it: a writer I like and respect recommending a podcast that dealt with weight loss to one of her followers. I tracked it down it was good, sensible, interested in the emotional causes of overeating and calamitous yo-yo dieting, entirely nonjudgmental.But it was also a million miles from any aural aesthetic I would normally gravitate to – upbeat, California, determined. And its host, the fantastically named Brooke Castillo, with her theories of how to bypass the busy, naysaying part of your brain and engage the bit that knows what’s best for you, has a strategy for everything: shedding the pounds, cutting back on the booze, making gazillions, organising your sock drawer, building a windfarm in your back garden (OK, not that one, but I bet she’s working on it). In they drop, these little bursts of can-do, must-do, will-do enthusiasm, once a week, all tied up by Brooke – who’s known hard times, let me tell you – enjoining you to have a wonderful week while she’s walking her dogs. I listened to her entire back catalogue, and then began to venture more broadly into the world of the motivational, seeking out experts in all manner of things that might ail you.I would not say I was a woman with problems not unless you count poor impulse control, specifically in relation to red wine and rich cheese, a reluctance to exercise, a tendency to procrastinate when faced with anything involving a degree of uncertainty (tax returns, thank you letters, travel arrangements and, most worryingly for my chosen profession, writing), separation anxiety, attachment anxiety, unpredictable attacks of nameless dread. The usual. Amazingly, my lifelong devotion to literature, despite its ability to look deep into the human heart, has not yielded much in the way of targeted five-point plans. Nor, apparently, do these issues melt away as the years accrue rather, bad and self-destructive habits appear to become more entrenched and guilt-ridden.But here’s what made the difference: a simple decision not to fixate on whether these nuggets of basic, and occasionally schmaltzy, wisdom were rooted in the kind of philosophical and moral correctness for which I revere George Eliot, nor the delicate apprehension of human consciousness that I get from Virginia Woolf. But instead to ask: “Might they help me to tackle my inbox or say no to an unwise extra glass?”It turned out they did. I have no idea why, but somehow the messages I listened to while driving or making dinner or going to sleep seemed to take root and reappear at useful moments. And my other fear – that this level of what has come to be called self-care is just a cover for next-level narcissism – has also been unfounded. It turns out that when you’re not waking up every day cringing at your own shortcomings, you have more time to spend turning your face out to the world.The hunch that allows me to maintain a degree of brainy amour-propre is that the content of such self-help panaceas is only part of the deal. Perhaps the greater portion is the willingness to admit that one’s imperfections can have their edges smoothed off without a full-scale psychodynamic investigation and consequent dark night of the soul. Perhaps someone else can chip in with a word of advice, a tactic, a regime. Perhaps those thorny areas can, like all those unused apps on your phone, be offloaded until they’re once again needed and perhaps that will be never.So here I am, utterly incapable of solving the world’s problems, having sat beside enough hospital beds to know I can’t turn back the tide of illness or mortality, still surrounded by piles of paperwork and still, sadly, in pursuit of the ability to jump up in the morning, walk five miles and eat a probiotic breakfast. But I have, in the mantra of one of my favourite podcasts, decided to rescind permission to be cruel to myself as a result of these failures. There will be a nice voice to tell me how I can go back to try again and reassure me I haven’t got it all wrong. And that, in these brutal times, is not nothing.• Alex Clark is a writer and critic"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cb6f174f2f066d41753b926625d356beb8af32a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0919e2e297c1141f8b1f3eb3861ab3f9","title":"music for 2020 pop classical preview","story":"The queen of pop gets intimate, Taylor Swift feels the sunshine and Stormzy takes on the world … plus, classical celebrations begin for Beethoven’s 250thby  Alexis Petridis and  Andrew ClementsKrept and Konan’s last UK live show was at the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena, a rapturously received home town extravaganza with guest appearances from Stefflon Don and Stormzy. These dates, however, will find Britain’s most successful rap duo in more intimate surroundings. Their recent album, Revenge Is Sweet, meanwhile, showed an increasing maturity, with ruminations on mental health, suicide and loss amid the bragging.Tour begins 21 January, Stylus, LeedsFinally released after a series of delays – not to mention three albums that were apparently recorded, then scrapped – Schoolboy Q’s CrasH Talk completed his transformation from gangsta rapper to golf-playing proud father. Amid the bass-heavy party anthems, the lyrics were frequently agonised and self-baiting, marking out the rapper – an affiliate of Kendrick Lamar’s Black Hippy collective – as one of hip-hop’s more thoughtful, conflicted figures.Tour begins 25 January, O2 Academy, GlasgowThe Madame X Tour – in which Madonna plays small venues for the first time since 1985 – has had good reviews and bad publicity in equal measure. The audience in Las Vegas booed her when her show started two hours late, and one US fan attempted to sue her for it – but critics rushed to acclaim the performances. We shall see when she comes to London, where the most expensive tickets are an eye-watering £1,200.27 January–16 February, London PalladiumThe Malian singer-songwriter has carved out a unique niche for herself, combining an acting career with an impressively wide-ranging approach to music that’s seen her collaborate with everyone from Herbie Hancock and Bobby Womack to Damon Albarn and Disclosure. It highlights a disinclination to be pinned down that also informs her solo work: her last album, 2018’s Fenfo, ran the gamut from traditional Malian kora to 60s soul influences.Tour begins 30 January, Roundhouse, LondonCarly Rae Jepsen’s career has never again scaled the commercial heights of her 2012 hit Call Me Maybe – the song with the greatest chorus of the 21st century according to Billboard – but she has instead developed into one of pop’s more intriguing characters, wresting control of her own artistic direction, making consistently fascinating albums, including 2019’s Dedicated, and gaining a noticeably older audience than her peers.Tour begins 7 February, Victoria Warehouse, ManchesterNever let it be said that rock music no longer throws up anything unexpected: the Hu garnered 25m YouTube views for their 2018 debut single Yuve Yuve Yu, on which the Ulaanbaatar quartet melded heavy metal with Mongolian throat singing. Their debut album The Gereg became a global hit in 2019, a sign that they’d hit on something truly unique.Tour begins 8 February, Chalk, BrightonThe Slow Rush is the first album by the expansive Australian psychedelicists for five years, and the follow-up to Currents, which established them not merely as an adventurous musical force but an influence on mainstream pop. Rihanna covered one of its tracks, New Person, Same Old Mistakes frontman Kevin Parker went on to collaborate with Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Travis Scott. Judging by the tracks that have trailed it, The Slow Rush elaborates on the synth-heavy direction of its predecessor.14 FebruaryA one-off gig for the largely female septet whose debut album Blume – a rare foray into jazz, or rather, a convincing blend of jazz, Afrobeat, funk, surf guitar and all points in between, for noted indie label Domino – was released to loud applause in August. But the band really come into their own on stage, adding a rawness and dynamism to their improvisations.18 February, Village Underground, LondonThe three singles thus far released from the 1975’s delayed fourth album have encompassed everything from two-step garage and distorted, yowling punk rock to monologues from Greta Thunberg. Who knows what else it might contain? Not every avenue the 1975 try to head down yields perfect results, but there’s something laudable about an arena-packing band so determined to avoid resting on their laurels.21 FebruaryGrimes’ fifth album has had a tortuous gestation: initially scheduled for 2018, it was delayed amid arguments with her record label and considerable personal strife, including the death of her former manager and negative media coverage of her relationship with Elon Musk. It is apparently a dark concept album about “an anthropomorphic goddess”, which aims to make the notion of climate change “fun”. We shall see.21 February2019 was a good year for the former Lizzy Grant. Her sixth album, the Joni Mitchell-influenced, Laurel Canyon-set Norman Fucking Rockwell!, topped a lot of critics’ end of year lists. Some publications went so far as to suggest it is one of the albums of the decade. The tour that bears its name has already visited the US and the Middle East. Her career-ning set apparently ends with the album’s epic, 10-minute long centrepiece Venice Bitch.Tour begins 25 February, O2 Arena, LondonBarrington Hendricks promoted his third album of experimental hip-hop under the Jpegmafia name as “a disappointment”. No one else seemed to agree with that assessment, though. It was more approachable and melodic than his past work, yet its sound remained chaotically eclectic – he’s claimed influences from both Ol’ Dirty Bastard and Throbbing Gristle – and his stream-of-consciousness vocal style was as manic and provocative as ever. How its glitchy collage approach works live remains to be seen.Tour begins 27 February, EartH, London called Michael Kiwanuka’s eponymous third album – a song cycle displaying the influences of gospel, psychedelic soul and Jimi Hendrix, co-produced by Danger Mouse and London hip-hop auteur Inflo – “one of the greatest albums of the decade”, evidence of how finely crafted its songs were, and how perfectly it balanced the retro and contemporary. In addition, he is a gripping live performer, capable of expanding his material without seeming indulgent.Tour begins 1 March, O2 Academy, BirminghamSaxophonist and composer Cassie Kinoshi’s 10-piece band are in the thick of London’s young jazz revival: their lineup shares members with Sons of Kemet, Kokoroko and Maisha. Their Mercury-nominated debut album Driftglass was an uncompromising, politically engaged yet accessible melding of 60s Blue Note and South African jazz with funk, hip hop and neo-soul, marked out by the sharpness of Kinoshi’s writing.Tour begins 15 March, Blue Arrow, GlasgowKelis’s 1999 debut album Kaleidoscope marked not just her own arrival but a leap in the profile of producers Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, AKA the Neptunes. Her career since has been uneven, pinballing from chart-friendly EDM to collaborations with TV on the Radio’s David Sitek, but on this tour she returns to her debut, now 20 years old and still sounding, as she would put it, young, fresh and new.Tour begins 16 March, Albert Hall, ManchesterDespite being recorded without the pair ever actually meeting up in the studio, Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey’s most recent album, Who, proved an unexpected triumph: a tough, bolshy collection of songs and a distinct improvement on 2006’s Endless Wire. Their recent live shows have been impressive too, spiking the usual classics with deeper es into their back catalogue.Tour begins 16 March, Manchester ArenaBaxter Dury already had a cult following, but his last album, Prince of Tears, was a considerable step forward and one of 2017’s best: musically eclectic, its lyrics alternately thoughtful and scabrously funny, the sound of an artist finally coming into his own. The menacing, darkly comic single Slumlord – a jaded view of the world of social media, packed with “scary people saying silly shit” – suggests its follow-up is of the same standard.Released 20 MarchIt’s five years since Dan Snaith released an album under the Caribou name, the brilliant Our Love. In the interim, he has seemed more preoccupied by his straightforwardly dancefloor-facing alias Daphni. All of which makes Caribou’s forthcoming return with a new album, Suddenly, and a series of live dates, all the more welcome. The single You and I suggests there has been no dip in the quality of his warm, melancholy electronica.Tour begins 30 March, Brighton Dome2019 was a good year for Ohio-born, LA-based rapper Trippie Redd. His mixtape A Love Letter to You 4 entered the US charts at No 1, evidence of his shift from Soundcloud cultdom to mainstream success. Stylistically varied or hopelessly unfocussed, depending on your perspective, its best moments suggested an artist who could turn his hand to anything from guitar-heavy emo rap to straight-up club bangers.Tour begins 4 April, Brixton Academy, LondonStyles has by some distance the most successful solo career of any ex-One Directioner. There have been more takers for his brand of pop-by-way-of-classic-rock than his former bandmates’ dalliances with R\u0026ampB and Sheeran-esque acoustic whimsy. Whether recently released second album Fine Line will repeat the commercial performance of his eponymous debut remains to be seen, but the level of devotion Styles inspires suggests it will.Tour begins 15 April, Birmingham ArenaSaucerful of Secrets, in which the Pink Floyd drummer and a range of musical associates including Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp charge through key tracks from Pink Floyd’s pre-Dark Side of the Moon repertoire, could well have flopped. Instead, it’s been a huge success, garnering praise from his former bandmates and fans alike. These gigs come under the banner of More Games for May, a reference to Pink Floyd’s 1967 gig at the Royal Festival Hall.Tour begins 23 April, G Live, GuilfordJustin Vernon’s musical progress from his folky debut For Emma, Forever Ago has been one of the more interesting in alt-rock, taking in detours to electronica, R\u0026ampB and hip-hop: his most recent album i,i featured cameo roles for everyone from rap producer Wheezy to Bruce Hornsby, which gives you an idea of its breadth. It’s also pleasing that experimental music can end up in venues this big.Tour begins 26 April, Wembley Arena, LondonNick Cave’s most recent live activities have involved solo performances and an unmoderated audience Q\u0026ampA – a kind of IRL version of his Red Hand Files website, where fans are invited to ask him anything. This tour, however, brings back backing band the Bad Seeds, in the wake of their wildly acclaimed 2019 album Ghosteen. It will be intriguing to see how that album’s beatless songs work in arena-sized venues.Tour begins 2 May, Birmingham ArenaAn offshoot of Radio 3’s beloved Unclassified show, this series of gigs at the Southbank Centre pitches modern classical composers against artists working in the field of electronica. Owen Pallett and Daniel Avery offer new compositions in earlier instalments, but this final show features electronic sound artist Tim Hecker alongside composer Daniel Elms. 7 June, Royal Festival Hall, LondonThe Radiohead frontman’s solo tour is named after his 2014 album Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes rather than its 2019 successor Anima. He is accompanied by producer Nigel Godrich and visual artist Tarik Barri providing live projections. Thus far, the setlist has occasionally taken in Radiohead tracks, but largely concentrated on Yorke’s solo oeuvre and the work of his supergroup Atoms for Peace. By all accounts, the live performances add a drive and focus to his experimental electronica.Tour begins 19 June, SEC Centre, GlasgowThe news that Diana Ross will fill the Sunday afternoon “legend” slot at this year’s Glastonbury festival was greeted with widespread delight: it’s a combination that looks about as close to a nailed-on success as it’s possible to get. But Glastonbury is merely one stop on a UK tour, and if the setlist is anything like that of her acclaimed Vegas residency – heavy on Supremes hits and her Chic-produced disco era – it’s going to be a treat.Tour begins 30 June, Leeds ArenaThis year’s British Summertime gigs in Hyde Park include a pop extravaganza headlined by Little Mix, and Pearl Jam performing with the Pixies as support, but the pick of them may be the arrival in the UK of Taylor Swift’s self-styled Lover Fest, wherein she eschews her usual stadiums in favour of taking her most recent album around the world’s festivals. “The Lover album is open fields, sunsets, + SUMMER,” she explained on Instagram. “I want to perform it in a way that feels authentic.”11 July, Hyde Park, LondonThe breakout teen sensation of 2019, whose debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? spawned five US platinum singles, returns to the UK for a series of arena gigs. The sense that her home-produced brand of dark electronics, adolescent psychodrama and gothic sci-fi imagery is a cut above has been bolstered by critical acclaim and comparisons not to her pop peers, but Nirvana – the latter courtesy of Dave Grohl.Tour begins 21 July, Manchester ArenaYou can get a sense of how far Stormzy has outstripped his UK hip-hop peers by the sheer geographical variety of dates on the tour supporting his second album, Heavy Is the Head. His sound is still rooted in British grime, as evidenced by recent single Wiley Flow, but his gigs take in not just Europe but the Middle East, China and Australasia. The biggest shows, however, will be in Britain: a stadium-sized victory lap.Tour begins 2 September, O2 Arena, LondonThe mammoth Farewell Yellow Brick Road tour enters its third year with a string of UK dates. Thus far it has proved notable not merely for its vast commercial success – the first leg alone grossed $125m – but the degree of acclaim it’s received. It is a beautifully staged two-and-a-half-hour extravaganza in which the hits are rolled out with considerable gusto – apparently for the final time.Tour begins 2 November, O2 Arena, LondonBeethoven will dominate the concert schedules in his 250th anniversary year, and his only opera, Fidelio, gets a new production at Covent Garden, with Lise Davidsen and Jonas Kaufmann heading the cast. Before that, however, the BBC Symphony Orchestra begins its year with the European premiere of David Lang’s contemporary take on the Fidelio story Claron McFadden is the unnamed woman struggling to save her partner from wrongful imprisonment. 11 January, Barbican, LondonFor more than a quarter of a century John Adams’s first was indelibly associated with Peter Sellars’ original 1987 production. But recently there have been a whole new generation of Nixon stagings, including John Fulljames’s version, first seen in Copenhagen and now shared with Scottish Opera. Joana Carneiro conducts a cast led by Eric Greene as Richard Nixon and Mark LeBrocq as Mao Tse-Tung.18-22 February, Theatre Royal, Glasgow 27-29 February, Festival Theatre, EdinburghThe Philharmonia reconstructs the historic concert that Beethoven gave in Vienna on 22 December 1808, which included the premieres of his Fifth and Sixth Symphonies and the Fourth Piano Concerto, as well as the Choral Fantasy. Esa-Pekka Salonen conducts the monumental programme, which also includes movements from the Mass in C and the concert aria Ah! Perfido.15 March, Royal Festival Hall, LondonThis Canadian-born, London-based composer is one of the artists-in-residence at the 73rd Aldeburgh festival. As well as Tracery, a new multi-speaker, split-screen installation, there’s the first performance of a work commissioned for soprano Juliet Fraser and the Bozzini Quartet, and the UK premiere of Miller’s A Large House for string orchestra and percussion.13, 16 and 20 June, Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/749606117f427ed866bc206c93c721e86c825704/0_171_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3315d3b4a5fc49b54fb6b60338fb4788","title":"do you have a favourite tree share your pictures and stories","story":"As part of a new series, we’d like you to tell us about your favourite tree and why it’s special to youAs deforestation continues to threaten green space around the world, and the ’s Christmas appeal launches to tackle it, we’d like to celebrate our trees.Outside of their ecological value, many of us have sentimental attachment to trees.

But 12 months on, what has changed? Has there been any tangible improvement?While some brands continue to pump out clothes like there is no tomorrow (which if they carry on, there won’t be), many of us are rethinking the quantities of clothes we buy. Greta Thunberg was i-D’s most memorable cover star, “the girl who changed the world”, who turned up for the interview dressed in a purple puffer jacket, bright-pink snow trousers and rubber boots. “Her wardrobe is limited, she doesn’t want new things,” the magazine reported.In July, the Swedish Fashion Council cancelled Stockholm fashion week to explore more sustainable options, and Extinction Rebellion called for London Fashion Week to do the same. London fashion week went ahead as planned but the final day was marked by a symbolic funeral where XR Fashion members grieved for the industry.Never has the fashion and textile industry been such a focus of attention, primarily because of its disproportionate contribution to greenhouse gas emissions – 1.2bn tonnes of CO2 per year according to Greenpeace, more than that produced by international shipping. In August, 32 companies representing around 150 brands signed the Fashion Pact at the G7 summit, promising to cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 and to ban virgin plastic from packaging – by 2030. Considering that, according to the UN, we only have 10 years left to limit global warming to 1.5C, these are hollow targets.It’s not only the environment that the industry continues to disregard. The fire in December at the New Delhi bag factory, where around 100 people were sleeping overnight, resulted in more than 40 deaths. “Six years on from the Rana Plaza factory collapse, most brands still have far too little visibility of their supply chains,” said Carry Somers, co-founder of the organisation behind the #whomademyclothes campaign, Fashion Revolution. “Transparency leads to accountability which leads to change.” The Fashion Transparency Index is also pushing the industry towards greater transparency with year on year improvement for many of the brands listed. In a welcome move towards transparency, H\u0026ampM announced back in April that it would share details such as production country, supplier names, and names and address of factories with its customers. It has been a year of big statements by famous names, perhaps the boldest being Gucci’s claim in September that it was now carbon neutral. The greenwash radar went into overdrive. “The best way to get to zero emissions is to close the company, but then 18,000 people will lose their jobs. When we talk about the environment, we need to keep that in mind as well,” said CEO Marco Bizzarri. “Offsetting is better than not doing anything…”While some industry leaders are at least starting to send out positive messages, policy makers are not so enthusiastic. In June, the government rejected recommendations made by the environmental audit select committee to regulate the fast fashion industry, including a charge of 1p for each garment to fund better clothing collection and sorting, and a ban on incinerating unsold clothes or sending them to landfill. “The government is out of step with the public, who are shocked by the fact that we are sending 300,000 tonnes of clothes a year to incineration or landfill,” said the former Labour MP Mary Creagh, who chaired the committee.Despite the government’s inability to legislate, fashion activism was on the rise. In September, 62,000 people took part in Oxfam’s Secondhand September campaign, pledging to buy nothing new in an attempt to stem the flow of the 11m items of clothing sent to landfill every week in the UK. And an alternative to Black Friday is gaining momentum in the form of Buy Nothing Day. “In a world of overconsumption and fast fashion, one of the most radical things we can do is to keep our clothes in use for as long as possible,” declared the designer Christopher Raeburn, who closed the tills at his two stores and spent the day doing on-the-spot clothing repairs instead.The willingness to embrace new ways of shopping that disrupt the high-volume, fast-fashion model, such as resale platforms (Vestiaire Collective and Depop both popped up at Selfridges this year and continue to grow their audiences) and rental (witness the takeover of the (British) Fashion Awards in December by rental platform My Wardrobe HQ) – is tangible.Bethany Williams scooped the prize for best emerging talent for menswear at awards, having already won the Queen Elizabeth II award for design earlier in the year. She was also shortlisted for the LVMH prize and is nominated for the upcoming Arts Foundation award (winner announced in January). Her business model gives back to the social enterprises she works with to weave cloth from waste materials, and to charities who benefit from a percentage of her profits. Now that’s progress.

It’s an invasion of the lifestyle snatchers about a wealthy family who hire live-in servants without realising that they are all one family, a cuckoo-in-the-nest gang of predators planning to take over.7 FebruaryA superbly elegant, enigmatic period drama from French film-maker Céline Sciamma.

Honor Swinton Byrne and Tilda Swinton reprise their original roles.To be confirmedFor three decades, Terry Gilliam’s epically delayed attempt to make a film version of Don Quixote has been one of the great what-ifs and whens of film history, an ordeal of bad luck, wrecked sets and lost funding that has outlived two of the actors cast: John Hurt and Jean Rochefort. Now it is finally made, with Jonathan Pryce in the lead.To be confirmedThe wild man of French cinema is back.

No spoilers, but Halloween Ends has just been announced for 2021, so we suspect both characters may emerge from this film vaguely in tact.John Krasinski’s character may be dead, but he’s back as director for this follow-up to his smash hit film about a family – headed by his real-life wife, Emily Blunt – who must live in silence lest they alert only-auditory monsters to their presence.

It’s written by twins who were responsible for the first two Conjuring movies and is directed by Floria Sigismondi, the Italian music video supremo whose only previous film is 2010’s The Runaways.Jordan Peele refreshes the man in the mirror for a new generation in this “spiritual sequel” to the 1992 horror, which returns to the same, now gentrified Chicago neighbourhood – and to Tony Todd as the vengeful ghost of the son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century. Todd gave his blessing to Peele’s involvement at the inception, saying “I’d rather have him do it, someone with intelligence, who’s going to be thoughtful and dig into the whole racial makeup of who Candyman is and why he existed in the first place”.

It’s restorative if you’re starting the decade out with a sore head, and also works at lunch or dinner time.This dish can combine various leftovers you’ll find in a stocked, post-Christmas fridge, but it can also be pulled together using pantry staples.Pretty much any small, oven-safe bowl, ramekin, dish or tray will work for this dish. Inidual portions will allow you to tailor each serve to specific dietary needs and whims. This dish works well with leftover roast vegetables and preserved meats, which will warm up as the eggs cook. Thinly sliced and quick-cooking raw ingredients like baby spinach and cherry tomatoes can also be used.Prep: 5 min Cook: 10-15 min Serves: Portions are limited only by your eggs, leftovers and hungerHeat oven to 180C. Cover the base of various ceramic dishes with vegetables, cheeses, legumes and meats, in combinations that take your fancy.Don’t layer more than a centimetre or so deep, and leave a small ot in the centre for the egg yolk to nestle into.Crack one or two free-range eggs into centre of the dishes, allowing the white to run through the components and the yolk to sit on display. Salt well.Bake on a tray, keeping a close eye out as the egg starts to set and become white. This should take about eight to 10 minutes for a small dish with a single egg, or 12 to 15 minutes for a wetter ramekin of goodies with two eggs.As soon as the whites have transformed from wobbly and translucent to white, or even when they’re still a little on the wobbly side, remove from the oven. The yolks will still be very runny, as the other ingredients will insulate them from overcooking.Carefully remove from the oven and allow the dishes to rest for a couple of minutes while your toast cooks.

Frank Lampard spent the majority of a scrappy contest bemoaning his team’s sloppiness in the final third and they paid a heavy price, suffering another stumble in the race to qualify for the Champions League when Alireza Jahanbakhsh came off the bench to rescue a deserved draw for Brighton with an astonishing bicycle kick.Inconsistent and imprecise, Chelsea have not won successive Premier League games since the start of November and they could not complain after failing to withstand a spirited comeback from Brighton. Lampard, who was outmanoeuvred by Graham Potter’s tactical alterations, had much to ponder.It was a disappointing effort from Chelsea and the lack of incision should convince the club to take advantage of their transfer ban being lifted as speculation mounts about moves for Jadon Sancho, Moussa Dembélé, Wilfried Zaha and Timo Werner.“It was an incredible equaliser but I think we deserved it,” Lampard said. “In the first half, if we are ruthless, the game is out of sight. We had opportunities to play people in who could score, to keep doing what we did in the first 20 minutes. We came off that slightly. We allowed them to feel they’re in the game and they’re a good team.“The Christmas period has probably been a small showing of our season. Tottenham was a fantastic performance. Arsenal showed great spirit for a young group. Southampton, we struggled to break a team down and lost at home. Then today we should have the mindset to kill it and we don’t.”Lampard was fuming and he stonewalled suggestions Chelsea could include Olivier Giroud as part of an £80m deal to sign Zaha from Crystal Palace. “The idea of that deal is something I have never considered,” the Chelsea manager said. “I won’t talk about Zaha because he is not a player of ours. If we have to do business we will do it in the way we see fit, to try to make us better, and that’s behind closed doors.”Nonetheless Chelsea’s forwards should be worried. Christian Pulisic flattered to deceive before being replaced by Callum Hudson-Odoi, who was just as ineffective on the left, and Willian offered little on the right. There was a lack of care in the decisive areas and Lampard grew irritable as the first half wore on, grumbling when Tammy Abraham spurned a chance to add to César Azpilicueta’s 10th-minute goal, shooting when he could have released Willian.Not that it was all about the big team’s failings. This was Brighton’s first ever point against Chelsea and they might even have snatched all three after Jahanbakhsh’s stunner, only for Kepa Arrizabalaga to repel Neal Maupay’s low drive. Arrizabalaga would also make a fine stop from Aaron Connolly, whose introduction at the break gave Brighton more urgency. “I thought the players were amazing,” Potter said. “You go toe to toe with Chelsea and if you make mistakes they punish you. We had to adjust because our structure wasn’t so good in the first half. We got better.”Chelsea, back to 4-2-3-1 after ditching their 3-4-3 system 34 minutes into their victory over Arsenal, started well, and took the lead after Reece James, included at right-back after a surprisingly quick recovery from an ankle injury, won a corner. Willian crossed to the far post, where Kurt Zouma headed down for Abraham to shoot from close range. Aaron Mooy blocked on the line but the ball broke to Azpilicueta, who turned in his third goal of the season.At that stage, with Brighton uncomfortable in a midfield diamond, Chelsea should have pulled clear. But perhaps it was too easy. Chelsea’sintensity faded and Brighton threatened before half-time, Maupay teeing up Leandro Trossard to test Arrizabalaga.Brighton, who will be without Dan Burn for two months after the left-backbroke his collarbone in a collision with James, were improving.Potter jettisoned the diamond and he made another alteration during the interval, removing Yves Bissouma for Connolly.The change meant Brighton were using a 4-4-2 and Potter was rewarded for throwing caution to the wind. Arrizabalaga denied Connolly but the breakthrough arrived when Lewis Dunk’s header led to Jahanbakhsh’s moment of magic.

On that occasion Isaac Hayden’s dismissal left Bruce’s team a man short this time, an injury to Fabian Schär shortly after half‑time, and with all three home substitutes already used, virtually rubber‑stamped Rodgers’s latest victory.It needs stressing that, well before fortune started frowning on Newcastle, James Maddison’s excellence had already indicated Leicester would cement their grip on second place. Maddison was outstanding in midfield, at times making even the 10-point chasm between his side and Liverpool seem surmountable.“We played very well,” Rodgers said. “We want to finish as high as possible. The potential excites me.”By way of exacerbating Geordie gloom, his goal originated with Florian Lejeune’s horribly underhit pass being intercepted by the Spaniard. All that remained was for Pérez to cleverly dodge Schär’s lunging attentions and direct a right‑foot shot into the far corner.Poor Lejeune had little chance to compose himself before making another awful mistake. This time his appalling clearance was intercepted by Ricardo Pereira, prefacing Maddison’s goal. After shifting the ball on to his left foot, Maddison unleashed a drive which, in whizzing inexorably into the top corner, simultaneously sent defiant messages to Liverpool and Manchester City and destroyed any remnants of new year optimism still lurking on the Gallowgate End.Bruce’s scope for tactical adjustment was negated by the late first-half hamstring and groin injuries to Jetro Willems, Javier Manquillo and Jonjo Shelvey which necessitated their swift replacement by DeAndre Yedlin, Emil Krafth and Sean Longstaff.With all three substitutes on and the second half barely under way Schär then pulled up with another hamstring pull, promptly hobbling off.Deja vu descended. Once again Newcastle were down to 10 men and struggling badly against a Leicester side who, by way of variation, slowed the pace to exhibition level before the substitute Hamza Choudhury scored his first senior goal.Choudhury’s dangerous tackle during Leicester’s League Cup win here in August left Newcastle’s much missed Matt Ritchie requiring two ankle operations and his every touch was duly booed.Not that the vitriol raining down from the stands prevented Choudhury meeting Wilfred Ndidi’s pass and unleashing a rising shot which consigned Bruce’s side to a third successive defeat.“I’ve never known four players injured within 15 minutes,” the Newcastle manager said. “It’s bizarre. To play so many games over Christmas is ridiculous and this is the consequence. But Leicester are very good.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d02a0917ba3c4cc7a32f52cb0a570866ba4780c4/2_152_3460_2076/master/3460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f0b70568f2f310625e7460887eb31db2","title":"manchester city everton premier league match report","story":"Manchester City end the festive period with nine points from their four games after a pair of Gabriel Jesus goals handed a first defeat with Everton to Carlo Ancelotti. The visitors held out until early in the second half but ultimately could not deny Pep Guardiola’s side who were as relentless in hunting the win as ever.City’s sole reverse of the Christmas programme came last Friday at Wolves in a result that, surely, killed any hopes of catching Liverpool. Instead, their FA Cup defence begins on Saturday, before next week’s EFL Cup semi-final encounter with Manchester United ahead of February’s restart of the Champions League: all are competitions which City can now focus intently on.Guardiola made five changes for what was a sixth game in 17 days. While he gave Phil Foden a second league start Claudio Bravo’s retention was notable as the hardly reliable goalkeeper played a second successive time due to Ederson being ill following a one-match suspension. The last time Bravo faced Everton – in January 2017 – he allowed four goals from four shots. And he would add to the count here by being culpable for Everton’s consolation, the Chilean lining up behind a 3-4-1-2 that had two holding midfielders – Rodri and Fernandinho – in defence.Ancelotti initially made the same number of changes as his opposite number before Bernard suffered a cut leg in the warm-up, so Tom Davies was drafted in for the Brazilian.The opening period proved low grade. An error from Ilkay Gündogan had Guardiola muttering and Davies pouncing as Everton transformed defence into an attack that ended with Gylfi Sigurdsson flipping the ball to Seamus Coleman: his effort was tipped behind for a corner by Bravo.When Gündogan later tried his own chip into Riyad Mahrez Jordan Pickford was less sure: he dropped the ball and Everton were relieved to clear.João Cancelo has struggled for form since signing yet he came close to creating the opener for Foden only for VAR to rule Mahrez offside. Ancelotti had a consoling word for Guardiola who smiled at his Everton counterpart but he still embarked on animated chat with Kevin Friend, the fourth official.The next time VAR became involved it was confused as it checked for a possible penalty despite Mahrez seeming to be flagged for offside or handball or both. The spot-kick was not given but the contest had been disrupted and, inevitably, the anti-VAR chants had a second airing in a matter of moments.Both benches were unhappy at this stage with their respective players’ output. For Guardiola it was Kevin De Bruyne and Foden momentarily losing their deft touch for Ancelotti it was his men’s sluggish pace and an insistence on passing back to Pickford, instead of looking forward for options.Better from City was a Mahrez swivel and shot, then a Gündogan effort which also warmed Pickford’s fingers. Really, though, the entertainment level was down in a sign perhaps of the Christmas and New Year slog. Another was found in the number of offsides committed by tired players – Mahrez a particular perpetrator.Still, City had dominated the ball and when they do they often prosper. Foden’s lack of regular action meant he was fresh and it was his snap-shot – gathered by Pickford – that was the first half’s last real threat on goal. As the break neared Mahrez had two clearer chances but steered the first wide and seemed surprised to receive the second.The average fare continued after the interval. Benjamin Mendy sold De Bruyne short so he had to stick a boot out and watch the ball sail into no-man’s land much to Guardiola’s chagrin. Next Bravo punted possession straight out when Cancelo was the target. Then, though, came a moment to remember. Gündogan slipped a pinpoint pass into Jesus who in an instant had beaten Pickford with a finish that was the Brazilian’s 13th goal this season.From the restart Everton claimed a corner – to Guardiola’s supreme annoyance – but despite a second one following when Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s header deflected out there was no equaliser.The contest had opened up. Suddenly Eric García was curving a ball along the left to Mahrez as City upped pace and so opportunity. And now they had a second strike and this was straight from the Guardiola playbook.De Bruyne passed to Foden who found Mahrez, who in turn played in Jesus and he calmly finished low past Pickford. City were coasting but then Bravo added to the catalogue of howlers by passing direct to Richarlison. From here there was an inevitability about how Theo Walcott – a recent substitute – took aim, the ball skimmed off Mendy, and there was Richarlison to bundle home. Despite a late rally from the visitors City ended with a deserved three points."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fbb187df9e2574d94bc3d1f5b94a8048e7dfd5c/57_75_1238_743/master/1238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e46f622fbb2bc98191ba39bdca3c5ab7","title":"watford wolves premier league match report","story":"Nigel Pearson is surprised at how much he is enjoying life back in the Premier League. Watford, too, are revelling in his return as the manager has transformed their fortunes since his arrival last month. Six points adrift at the bottom when he was appointed, they are now within touching distance of safety thanks to this hard-fought win over Wolves that took their tally from the last four matches to 10 points.Normally teams in trouble fall apart when things go against them but Watford are doing the opposite, with this game being the second in a row they have won despite being reduced to 10 men. Christian Kabasele had a yellow card upgraded to a red with more than 20 minutes left but Watford fended off Wolves, who could not add to Pedro Neto’s goal. The ones scored by Gerard Deulofeu and Abdoulaye Doucouré were enough to fuel increasingly realistic hopes of a successful rescue mission by Pearson.“There is a lot of hard work to be done and it would be foolish to think the job is over – it’s far from over – but we’ve given ourselves more of a chance by getting back in contact with the pack.”Troy Deeney attributes Watford’s improvement to the “no BS culture” that Pearson has fostered, explaining the manager’s “high standards” have inspired everyone at Vicarage Road. Wolves, mind you, made the better start and should have taken the lead.First, Ben Foster made a fine save to thwart Matt Doherty after an excellent pass from deep by Conor Coady. Then Doherty supplied a precise diagonal pass to Raúl Jiménez, who took the ball down on his chest before steering a shot way off target from 15 yards.Wolves felt wronged in the 22nd minute when Neto was booked for simulation after beating Craig Dawson to the ball and tumbling in the box over the defender’s outstretched leg. There was contact but not, according to the referee and VAR, enough to justify the defender’s fall.Then Watford began to assert themselves, especially through Deulofeu. In the 29th minute he wriggled into the box before feeding Ismaila Sarr, who forced a solid save from Rui Patrício from 12 yards. But the goalkeeper was beaten one minute later after a mistake by Leander Dendoncker, who gave the ball away to Sarr. The forward helped it on to Deulofeu, who fired into the far corner of the net.Watford nearly extended their lead from a simple throw-in, with Deeney flicking on Dawson’s delivery to Deulofeu, who skewed his shot over from close range.As with the first, Watford’s second goal, four minutes into the second half, originated in unusually loose play by Wolves, with Jiménez gifting away possession in midfield. Deulofeu skittered towards the area and fed Doucouré, who struck his shot well but needed a deflection off Coady to beat the goalkeeper.Neto gave Wolves fresh hope. The 19-year-old, who was so distraught to have a goal disallowed by VAR at Anfield on Sunday enjoyed good fortune this time as his shot from 20 yards took a nick off Kabasele and flew over Foster into the net.Neto was replaced by Diogo Jota, whose first involvement was to be pulled down at the edge of the area by Kabasele. The referee, Andrew Madley, showed the defender a yellow card but VAR advised him to change it to a red on the grounds that Jota would have had an obvious scoring chance if not for the foul.“We were hanging on a little bit but the desire of the players to keep the ball out of the net and put their bodies on the line was clear for everybody to see,” Pearson said. “That bodes well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d83f0db7d64635a4f4267836d7205f56239a63f/0_59_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=016d912928c458e177e51dfd32fd31df","title":"west ham bournemouth premier league match report","story":"As second comings go, David Moyes could not have scripted his any better. Two goals from the captain Mark Noble and one each from Sébastien Haller and Felipe Anderson ended West Ham’s run of four successive defeats at home and took them out of the relegation zone at the expense of a disjointed Bournemouth side.Out of work since he was jettisoned by West Ham’s owners in favour of Manuel Pellegrini in May 2018, how Moyes must have relished the “oles” which rang around the stadium as his side cantered to victory in the closing stages. Only a few days into his second spell as manager he has already shown what a difference a new face can make – something that even Bournemouth’s owners may even have to consider at some point given the lack of fight in Eddie Howe’s side here.“I don’t think I could have had a better start but the players have to take all the credit,” Moyes said. “Their attitude and commitment got the supporters behind us and that was key for us today.”The former Manchester United and Everton manager had spoken of the need to restore confidence among his players after the disastrous run that cost Manuel Pellegrini his job, yet after Aston Villa’s victory over Burnley, West Ham found themselves in the relegation zone before kick-off – almost exactly the same position as when he took over from Slaven Bilic in November 2017.Last time it took Moyes until his fourth match to record his first victory but with less than half of this campaign remaining, he knew there was no time to waste. Bournemouth looked like perfect opponents to kickstart the home side’s campaign given Howe’s visitors had lost seven of their previous nine matches before this. Howe also made four changes to the side which lost at Brighton on Saturday with Callum Wilson leading the line despite enduring a run of 12 matches without a league goal.Moyes, who admitted this week that he had not been able to stop smiling since his reappointment, emerged just before kick-off to a decent reception from the home supporters and spent almost the entire first half prowling the technical area, clearly enjoying being back in his natural habitat.After a slow start, the 56-year-old’s enthusiasm was rewarded in the 17th minute when Robert Snodgrass found Noble in acres of space and the captain’s shot from distance took a massive deflection off Lewis Cook to totally wrongfoot Aaron Ramsdale in the Bournemouth goal.Taking the lead – albeit through a huge slice of good fortune – seemed to immediately lighten the mood among the home supporters and it was not long until they were celebrating again. Haller, without a goal at the London Stadium since the defeat to Crystal Palace in October, has looked an increasingly dejected figure in recent weeks but the way he volleyed home a cross from Ryan Fredericks illustrated just why West Ham were prepared to pay £45m to sign him last summer.Noble’s second soon after from the penalty spot when Harry Wilson was somewhat harshly adjudged to have brought down the veteran midfielder almost lifted the roof off this vast arena. Having failed to score more than one first-half goal so far this season, suddenly West Ham had three.Bournemouth’s woes can be traced back to Wilson’s last league goal in the 3-1 victory over Southampton at the end of September. Howe’s side briefly found themselves in third place back then but, like Haller at West Ham, the lack of goals for their main striker has coincided with their plunge down the table. They have not looked so vulnerable since the 2017-18 season, when they were in the bottom three at Christmas before a seven-game unbeaten run catapulted them up the table. On this evidence that kind of form looks beyond them but Howe will at least be encouraged by a better performance after the break after they switched to a back three.Asked if his players are suffering from a lack of confidence, he said: “I don’t think it takes a rocket scientist to see it’s damaged. It’s the first time we’ve been in the relegation zone for a long time but I almost think that is a good thing for us because it’s going to refocus energies. We need to change something.”Anderson rounded off a fine inidual performance with the fourth goal following a wonderful cross field pass from Declan Rice with his left foot. Further evidence that this was West Ham’s day came when Aaron Cresswell was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on Ryan Fraser, only for VAR to overturn referee Graham Scott’s original decision. Moyes will just hope that his good fortune can last a little longer this time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6f7b662fc4d3b7923ebf9a9b6cc186004f89cd0/0_34_1908_1145/master/1908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c166d5696da913b19801caf99bdaa6f4","title":"arsenal v manchester united premier league live","story":"36 mins: Arsenal have been on top in this game since the opener and United do not seem to have a gear change. Is it down to the fixture schedule or just a bad performance? It might not be a bad idea. Lingard also not in the game. 34 mins: Torreira is the next to have a pop. He spins on the edge of the box, gets the ball onto his left foot and swings through his shot but the ball goes inches wide of De Gea’s left-hand post. 32 mins: Lacazette should double the lead. Pepe lays it into Lacazette in the area, he spins Maguire but then sends his shot closer to the corner flag than the goal.30 mins: Maguire then seems to catch Lacazette when jumping for a header but the referee sees nothing in it. It looks like Maguire catches the striker in the back of the head with his elbow, leaving the Frenchman to rub his head. There is nothing malicious in it but it should be a foul. 28 mins: Martial drives into the area but Sokratis gets round to clear the ball out of a throw. A less successful intervention from a centre-back sees Maguire clean out Ozil about five seconds late to stop a counter-attack. 26 mins: One obvious thing about United is how much they miss McTominay in the middle of the park. No one else can match his energy in there and things just look quite sluggish.To mix things up, a long ball is played over the top for Rashford to chase but Leno reads the danger and comes outside of his box to head clear. I think turning the defence and using the pace of their attackers could be a fruitful concept tonight.24 mins: United are popping the ball around a bit but they are struggling with the final pass. 22 mins: It might not be his best position but Aubameyang is dangerous on the left, whipping in a delightful cross with the outside of his boot which just defeats everyone and Shaw clears. Ian Collins writes in to discuss poor Luke: “Are we saying that Jose was right about the once great hope for England left back and that he’s just not that good?”I agree with Mourinho on everything.20 mins: Arsenal’s front four seem to have a better understanding than United’s who are yet to click tonight, playing some sloppy passes as attacks keep breaking down.18 mins: Maitland-Niles pulls down Rashford, who for added effect jumps up a bit to show it is a foul. United need to get Fred on the ball a bit more as Matic just does not have the passing range to cause problems. 16 mins: This sounds delightful ... as a fellow south Londoner, I can confirm this is not a regular occurrence but I am also quite pro-Pepe. 14 mins: Luiz is done for holding Martial on the halfway line, which is frankly pointless. He looks to be playing on the edge tonight. 12 mins: Shaw might be in a for dreadful evening trying to stop Pepe, purely because the United man isn’t actually very good. He does not look smart enough to keep the Arsenal man quiet.10 mins: Just before the goal I was typing about how United had started the better but needed to make the most of it. They proved me right. Pepe almost turns provider by rinsing Shaw just outside the area - in the end the defender does well to not give away a penalty - the winger then lifts a ball to the back post to Aubameyang who volleys over. Some fantastic work down the left flank from Kolasinac sees the defender get to the byline, from where he pulls the ball back into a dangerous area to a waiting Pepe and he sidefoots the ball into the back of the net. 6 mins: Maitland-Niles puts his team into trouble by passing the ball straight to Lingard who drives forward and slips in James but Arsenal recover and the ball is erted behind for a corner, which comes to nothing.4 mins: Kolasinac bundles over James who is far too quick for the full-back. The Arsenal defender in the end gets booked for his indiscretion - not good news for a man who is up against one of the fastest players in league. Fred whips in the set-piece but Leno comes out and punches clear.Martial is also unhappy after being caught late by Luiz, who gets away with it.2 mins: United start the game brightly and break on Arsenal, resulting in Lingard laying it off to Rashford who lines up a drive from 25 yards which dips and bounces but Leno gets himself behind it.Peep! Peep! Peep! Here we go!The players are in the tunnel but I doubt we will see any Vieira v Keane-esque shenanigans. Looks quiet. I think it’s fair to say it is a crisp day in London. Lovely night for a zipping the ball around the Emirates. The battle for second is still on!Graham Fulcher asks: “Re the small piece of news. I wonder if they would have been better extending the loan. Some players with Championship experience could prove invaluable next year.”I have a feeling he will be off elsewhere. Bristol City are very interested. Paul Mullally brings the pleasantries: “First off happy new year. As a lifelong United fan, Pogba missing tonight’s game is not surprising players hold the power in this day and age is Mino Raiola up to some mischief? Anyway enjoy the game United 2 Gooners 1.”Happy New Year to everyone! Even Mino.Small piece of Arsenal news: they have recalled Eddie Nketiah from Leeds.BT Sport have been surprisingly smug about being on air all day. It’s literally your job, lads. And well done for making Manchester United fans travel down to London for an 8pm kick-off.Kim Doyle is hoping for goals: “It is a new year for the Gunners and an offensive look that all the fans have been waiting for – Auba, Laca, Ozil and Pepe all starting. Perhaps a flurry of goals will follow.”Paul Pogba is “feeling some discomfort in his ankle and he’ll be out for a few weeks - definitely”, says Solskjaer. Hmmm ...Damned if you do, damned if you don’t.Some potential January moves in this morning’s Rumour Mill ...I am expecting Aubameyang to play on the left, which is a shame as it’s certainly not his best position but Arteta has obviously decided the way to go is to get all his best players onto the pitch and fit them into a formation. Bill emails in: “Re the 606 call (18.57), any analysis of Arsenal’s descent will have to include a look at the seemingly entitled, paranoid, delusional, highly critical parts of the fan base, I’d say. I think Arteta seems to have a great plan and be acting intelligently. No wonder he’s had to spend time rallying the fans, but should that be necessary? I can see the point of being vocal where it’s due (Emery was a mistake from the off), but surely support should go the other way, from fan to club”Welcome to a new year.No Pogba once again for United, which will fuel a few rumours, I am sure. He didn’t feature at Burnley due to some degree of fatigue. Can he still be tired?January business for United?Xhaka and Torreira are paired together as the wall to stop Manchester United and that Arsenal front four looks rather exciting: Pepe, Ozil, Aubameyang and Lacazette.Matic keeps his place in midfield for United, while Shaw will line up against Pepe, which will be an intriguing battle. An Arsenal ‘fan’ has just phoned up 606 to say they are going down and Aubameyang and Lacazette aren’t good enough. I know things aren’t great the the moment but to say the Gunners will be relegated is bizarre. Odd chap.Here’s David Hytner on Mikel Arteta’s worries.Manchester United have lost just once in their last nine games and will be hoping to carry that fine form on at the Emirates. Paul Pogba could be brought back into the side after sitting out the relatively routine 2-0 win over Burnley. Unlike Arsenal, United have plenty of players who have found consistency and look like they could genuinely challenge for a top-four spot. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial are very much on the same wavelength and Fred is running things from midfield, which is a bit of a shock considering the fact he spent a long time at the club looking woefully out of his depth and it’s even better news due to the injury to Scott McTominay. The United defence was never in trouble at Turf Moor, an impressive feat for a side who have struggled to keep cleansheets this season, not helped by their goalkeeper chucking one in.It’s a new year and new beginnings, which is cracking news for Arteta, while Ole Gunnar Solskjær will just want to carry on where he left off last year. Should be a cracker under the lights."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e94ca49a01df4283a20232fce7bd8c32a30e6bb4/0_121_4977_2986/master/4977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c248e95b9b2fa49bb08a013ea21ba5b6","title":"manchester city v everton premier league live","story":"Jamie Jackson was at the Etihad Stadium for the  - here’s how he saw the game unfold. Elsewhere in the Premier League: West Ham enjoyed a new manager bounce under David Moyes, running out 4-0 winners over Bournemouth, who look to be in serious trouble. A late equaliser from the lesser-spotted Connor Wickham enabled Crystal Palace to snatch a point after they came from behind to draw with Norwich. Earlier this afternoon, Watford continued their resurgence under Nigel Pearson with a win over Wolves, while Jose Mourinho’s mask of humility was conspicuous by its absence as Tottenham lost against Southampton. Newcastle ran out 3-0 losers against Leicester at home, while Villa won on their travels to the Burnley. In the day’s early kick-off, Brighton and Chelsea shared the points in an entertaining match at the Amex Stadium. And Everton? While they lost a game during which Carlo Ancelotti could repeatedly be seen urging his players to get the ball forward more quickly, Everton can take heart from this performance. They defended well for long periods, restricting City to a limited number of scoring opportunities. Ultimately, however, the class of the Premier League champions prevailed.A brace for Gabriel Jesus: The Brazilian striker scored twice and struck the post to win all three points for his team. They were entirely convincing but scored two good goals, before allowing Everton back into the game with a gift. Richarlison pounced at the far post after a kamikaze pass from Claudio Bravo left Joao Cancelo in all sorts of bother in his own penalty area.Peep! Peep! Peep! It’s all over at the Etihad Stadium, where City have won by the odd goal of three to move back to within a point of Leicester City. They remain in third place in the table, 11 behind leaders Liverpool. 90+4 min: Everton win a corner, which Theo Walcott will take once the Manchester City fans behind the goal give him the ball. They eventually oblige and his inswinger is headed clear by Kevin De Bruyne.90+3 min: Sterling comes on for Riyad Mahrez. 90+2 min: Two minutes into added time and Everton are struggling to get a touch of the ball. Raheem Sterling is on the touchline, waiting to come on, but City aren’t putting the ball out of play.89 min: Claudio Bravo takes an eternity over a goal kick as we prepare for a minimum of four minutes of added time. 88 min: Nothing comes from the corner, which City take short, happy just to keep hold of the ball as the clock ticks down. 87 min: City win a free-kick on the right flank and Kevin De Bruyne’s delivery is put out for a corner by Sidibe. 86 min: Down by the corner, Dominic Calvert-Lewin slides in to dispossess Fernandinho with a scything challenge. Manchester City’s players react furiously and the Everton striker is perhaps lucky to escape with just a yellow card.84 min: Dominic Calvert-Lewin picks up a long ball over the top in a good position on the right byline. He dithers over what to do next and wastes an opportunity to dink it over Bravo towards Kean at the far post. 83 min: Manchester City substitution: Phil Foden makes way for David Silva.82 min: Gabriel Jesus is flat on his back in the Everton penalty area after being caught by Yerry Mina. He’ll live.80 min: Eric Garcia denies Moise Kean with a good tackle shortly after Tom Davies is booked.78 min: It’s all City at the moment as they lay siege to the Everton goal. They missed out on a penalty because Sidibe got his foot to the ball as he stopped Foden with a last-ditch lunge. Moments later, Mahrez went close, before Gabriel Jesus rifled a shot off the upright.77 min: There are loud appeals for a penalty as Phil Foden goes to ground in the Everton box. None is forthcoming.77 min: Moise Kean spins and volleys towards goal after being picked out in the Manchester City penalty area. Wide, but not much.74 min: Jesus squanders an opportunity to bag his hat-trick after getting on the end of a Cancelo cross to the far post. His downward header is saved easily by Pickford. 72 min: It’s safe to say Pep will be seething at the concession of that goal, as City gifted the ball to them deep in their own territory. Joao Cancelo miscontrolled a daft pass from Claudio Bravo, allowing Theo Walcott to shoot from the edge of the box. His effort cannoned off Benjamin Mendy and was fizzing across the face of goal, leaving Richarlison with the easy task of firing hime. Manchester City give the ball away in their own penalty area and Richarlison pulls one back for Everton, hammering a cross in from close range at the far post.69 min: Everton give the ball away cheaply twice in quick succession in midfield. Fabian Delph is booked for a foul on somebody or other that leaves him hobbling away. From the ensuing free-kick, Riyad Mahrez heads wide of the upright under pressure from Davies. 67 min: Kean comes on for Everton and the captain’s armband goes around the biceps of Tom Davies.64 min: Manchester City continue to dominate as Everton prepare to bring on Moise Kean for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who took the captain’s armband from Seamus Coleman. A long spell of City possession ends with Yerry Mina conning a free-kick out of Andre Marriner with a theatrical collapse to the turf just outside his own box.62 min: Moments after that second goal went in, Everton brought on Theo Walcott. Seamus Coleman made way.61 min: It was a clinical finish to round off an excellent Manchester City move. Kevin De Bruyne kicked it off with a wonderful pass to Phil Foden, who found Mahrez. He picked out Jesus, who made a run into the box and the Brazilian made no mistake with his seventh goal in six games against Everton.Jesus doubles Manchester CIty’s lead, letting the ball run across his body before burying a low drive into the bottom corner at the near post with his left foot. 56 min: Yerry Mina and Riyad Mahrez tussle for a ball that eventually goes out of play for an Everton goal kick. Mahrez is none too impressed by what he perceives to be Mina’s roughhouse tactics after being shoved towards the advertising hoardings.55 min: That goal really seems to have sparked Everton into life and they are playing with a positivity that was hitherto lacking from their game.54 min: Everton win a corner and Dominic Calvert Lewin goes close with a header after getting on the end of Gylfi Sigurdsson’s inswinger. His effort is deflected out for another corner, from which nothing comes. 52 min: There are ironic cheers from Manchester City’s fans when the VAR officials finish poring over the footage of Jesus’s goal and can find no reason to rule it out. Jesus pounced on a wonderful ball into the Everton box from Ilkay Gundogan, cut inside Mason Holgate and curled the ball into the top right-hand corner. Jordan Pickford got a hand to it but couldn’t keep it out.Gabriel Jesus curls the ball into the top corner and it gets a helping hand on its way from Jordan Pickford. 50 min: Phil Foden marauds up the inside right channel before laying the ball off to Gabriel Jesus. Everton keep their shape well and force them backwards.49 min: The game is played out in near silence and to be fair to those present, there’s not much for either set of fans to cheer in the opening minutes of this second half. 47 min: Tom Davies wins a free-kick on the halfway line after being brought down by Kevin De Bruyne. 46 min: Play resumes with no changes to either side at half-time. Gabriel Jesus is flagged for offside as he gets on the end of a raking Kevin De Bruyne pass from deep and heads wide from a tight angle. Elsewhere in the Premier League: West Ham are beating the increasingly hapless Bournemouth 3-0 at half time, while Norwich are 1-0 up against Crystal Palace at Carrow Road. Earlier today, there were wins for Watford, Aston Villa and Leicester. Brighton and Chelsea drew 1-1 in the day’s early kick-off.The players go in for the break, with Manchester City having bossed possession, but created comparatively little in the way of goalscoring threats. They did have the ball in the Everton net, but VAR intervened and ruled that Riyad Mahrez had been offside in the build-up to Phil Foden’s tap-in.45+2 min: Everton win a corner late in the first half. Gylfi Sigurdsson sends the ball into the mixer, where Yerry Mina leaps highest. Under pressure from Eric Garcia, he put his header goes over the bar.45+1: It seems Mahrez controlled the ball with his hand, so any goal he scored would not have counted anyway. 44 min: Benjamin Mendy curls a cross into the Everton penalty area and it appears to drop kindly drops for Mahrez at the far post. Mason Holgate scrambles back and does enough to prevent the City winger firing off a shot.42 min: Riyad Mahrez drags a low diagonal effort wide of the far post after being teed up by Gabriel Jesus. It was on his weaker right foot, but he should have done better. 41 min: Manchester City continue to dominate possession, while Carlo Ancelotti continues to criticise his players for not trying to get it forward with enough urgency when they are allowed a touch of it. 38 min: Foden and Mendy combine down the left again and tee up Gabriel Jesus in the box. He strikes the bouncing ball with the outside of his left foot, then angrily admonishes himself when it sails wide. It was a poor effort. 36 min: Phil Foden shoots straight at Pickford from a narrowish angle after combining down the left flank with Benjamin Mendy. 36 min: Manchester City enjoy another spell of possession but are forced backwards by Everton, who will happy enough with how they have coped so far."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e2bd575a66e4295fbb59127f8aaed10880b5ce4/34_0_2779_1667/master/2779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a56f8b80b8e183281e833e5847a3ef3","title":"beginners guide to saving","story":"We all know squirrelling away some money is sensible – but that doesn’t necessarily make it appealing. Here’s how to get in the habitMuch like going for a run or eating your greens, saving your cash offers long-term benefits, but is not always appealing. And, let’s face it, there are always good reasons not to lock your money away – confusion over different accounts, fear of making the wrong choice, or feeling as though you don’t have enough money to make it worthwhile can all outweigh the best intentions. But, as the NHS’s Couch to 5K programme taught us about exercise, things are a lot less overwhelming if you start small and build up.Don’t worry if you have been putting it off for years – you can’t be too old to start saving. Whatever your age, you need to decide that saving is something you want, or need, to do, says Iona Bain, the founder of the blog Young Money. After all, she points out, “saving is only possible with motivation”.If you are struggling to feel driven, she has advice: “Saving gives you choices in the future. Once you start understanding that it’s still your money, just put somewhere safe in case you need it, you start finding that motivation that will make saving much easier.”Don’t start a savings account if you have expensive debt to pay off – you will be better off clearing an overdraft or credit card, as they charge higher interest rates than you can earn. But once these debts are cleared, you can start to think about building a nest egg.One option is to set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. The logic here is that if you cannot see the money in your current account you will not spend it. This is a good choice if you know how much you can afford to save each month.If you don’t, you can squirrel away money throughout the month using a round-up feature. Offered by the new online banks, including Revolut, Starling and Monzo, as well as Lloyds TSB and Halifax, these let you round up any spending to the nearest £1 and put the difference into a savings pot. So, if you spend £1.45, you will be debited £2, of which 55p will be squirrelled away.Alternatively, you could wait until the end of the month and sweep what is left in your current account into your savings. You can do this with any bank, but First Direct’s 1st account can be set up to do this automatically.As with Couch to 5K, it can be helpful to have a goal. Small, short-term targets are good at first, because they are achievable and will get you into good habits. It might be tickets for a show or an activity you have wanted to see for a long time, a new pair of jeans or a night away. Whatever it is, work out how much you need and when you need it.Once you have achieved your aim, do not close your account. You are in the habit now, so keep going.Bain says not to worry too much about savings rates at this point, but if you want an extra incentive, a website such as Savings Champion will show you the best-paying accounts. If you want to be able to withdraw your money in the next year, take a look at easy-access accounts.If you are saving for a property, think about using a Lifetime Isa. If you want to save for the long term, start exploring pensions and other investments. Some of these have minimum payment levels as low as £1, although small investments may disappear in fees, so you will need more to make it worthwhile – £25 a month is more typical and meaningful.“If you are investing over a short time period, certainly fewer than five years, then you should stick with cash, even though interest rates are currently at very low levels,” says Patrick Connolly, a chartered financial planner at the advice firm Chase de Vere. “This is because, if you invest in the stock market and it falls in value, you will have very little time to claw back any losses.”A good starting place if you have a small sum and do not want to take much risk is a fund that tracks the UK stock market. The Money Advice Service, an independent body set up by the government, has a useful guide on how to buy investments, with links to sites where you can research potential purchases."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d1d6723df63464b375586b4dcdc5d2bcb44c03a/0_538_2179_1308/master/2179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d61b687a626ec38f60f104d46cc2639","title":"how can i celebrate my friends new success without envy","story":"There are uncomfortable thoughts at the root of most envy, writes Eleanor Gordon-Smith, and more often than not those thoughts are about yourselfI’m struggling with jealousy over an old friend’s (well-deserved!) success. We both work in a creative industry, and when we were starting out we spent a long time consoling each other over (very cheap) red wine about the long, unpredictable luck-driven road to success in our field. We’re both good at what we do, and after years of slogging away, her latest project has taken off in a big way, with a whole new set of opportunities opening up. I want to feel happy for her in an uncomplicated way, but the moments of envy and “why not me?” keep creeping in, and I’ve found myself turning down invitations to catch up because of it. How can I handle those feelings in a healthy way and get back to celebrating her achievement?The comedian Billy Connolly tells a story about going back to his hometown and stopping at the pub to see his old mates. He dreads it because he knows that until the moment he opens the door everyone in that pub is perfectly happy with their lives. But then he walks in, and the lives that seemed full and warm just moments ago suddenly seem tinny and empty to the people who have to live them. He hates making his friends feel tinny.This is a way of saying that your friend is going to be feeling just as weird about this transition as you are. She knows how much of her own story is luck and she knows that your talent is equal to hers, which means that when she goes to sleep in the hotels that look so glamorous from the outside I promise you, on the struggling-artist sacrament of cheap wine, that she feels like she shouldn’t be there. So the good news is you’re in this together. You both want a friendship that doesn’t embarrass you.I think that’s what envy is, often: just curdled embarrassment. It’s not that we resent someone having what we want so much as we’re humiliated by the reminder that we didn’t get it. So your task might be speak candidly to yourself about why your friend’s success makes you squeamish and embarrassed. It could be that you think if you’d worked harder, you could be there too it might be that deep down you aren’t proud of everything you’ve produced. Whatever uncomfortable thought is at the root of those feelings (and I’d lay good money it’s about yourself) you should pull it out by the roots of its hair and squeeze it until it dies.Then you should go and do the best work you’ve ever done. Take your irritation and make it fuel. Write about it. Tear up what you’ve written and eat it. Do whatever you have to do to get the flywheel in your brain cranking until time goes stripy. Lose yourself in the work, splash in it, hate it, drink it, collapse in a heap at the end of the day knowing you did what Annie Dillard tells writers to do: “spend it all, shoot it, play it, lose it, all, right away, every time”.Who cares if it gets recognised? The creative world apportions its rewards with capriciousness at absolute best and mediocrity at worst. You don’t want that. You want the sweet earned exhaustion of having survived combat with a craft. When you’re proud of yourself for that, really proud in your marrow, the shiny things your friend has won’t look so good by comparison. In a few months’ time when she’s eyeballs deep in a press tour and her brain has rusted from going so long without that kind of work, she might very well start to envy you. And that’ll teach her.Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with? Eleanor Gordon-Smith will help you think through life’s questions and puzzles, big and small.

But how – and where do you find the time? Here are the tips and advice you need for a pleasure-filled yearThe last time I felt joy was at an event that would be many people’s vision of hell: a drunken Taylor Swift club-night singalong in the early hours of the morning a few weekends ago.I certainly experience joy, either as peaks of euphoria or in quiet, unexpected bursts. But as I go about my everyday business – sprinting to meet deadlines, standing in front of the open fridge – I wouldn’t say it looms large.I am not alone. Many of us treat joy like the good china, only warranted on special occasions. Even if we know it is within our reach, we may not see it is within our control.But this is a mistake, according to happiness experts. Nataly Kogan, the author of Happier Now, says: “Happiness and emotional health are not extras, or bonuses, or nice-to-haves – they’re actually at the core of what helps us live well.”Seeking joy may sound frivolous, but being happy has been shown to promote habits and behaviours that are important to our health. A 2017 study of roughly 7,000 adults found that those with positive wellbeing were more likely to be physically active and to eat fresh fruit and vegetables. Being happy has also been linked to better sleep, better weight management, lower stress levels, an improved immune system and even increased life expectancy.Despite the myriad benefits of joy – and the obvious incentive that it feels good – many of us don’t prioritise it. But experts point out that our resources and energy are finite what we put off will fall by the wayside. So, as with any goal, the first step to a joyful life is to make it a priority – which may mean you need to let go of other commitments – and then do the work. In other words, we need to start taking joy seriously.As the founder and chief executive of the wellbeing business Happier, Kogan helps companies to improve their workplace culture and professionals to foster joy in their lives – lessons born out of her experience of career burnout and personal dissatisfaction in her late 30s. She likens herself at the time to a ship on the ocean – fine in favourable conditions, but at the mercy of any storm.Now 44 and based with her family in Boston, Massachusetts, Kogan says she has landed on practices and tools to harness happiness as a steady, sustainable presence in her daily life. The first of these is not to think of happiness as something to pursue at a later date, when your life is in order. “I lived with this idea of: ‘I’ll be happy when ...’ as I know so many people do,” she says. “We have to look at emotional health as a skill, not a destination. And, as with any skill, when you practise, you do better.”So, what can we do to make 2020 a more joyful year?Start by identifying where joy is most lacking. Sarah Waite, a London-based psychologist, suggests the “wheel of life”, a personal development exercise derived from the Buddhist theory of balance. Draw a large circle, ide it into eight or 10 segments and label each to reflect a different area of life that you want to assess.There are templates online, typically along the lines of fun and recreation, physical environment, career, finances, personal growth, romance, family and friends, and health. Shade in each wedge to reflect your level of satisfaction.The finished circle should be an overview of the areas of your life that you feel you have under control, and those that may need further attention. When it comes to deciding where to allocate resources, “it’s not necessarily the one you’ve marked the lowest it’s the one you really value the most,” says Waite. It may be that your job is not a priority for you, so it doesn’t matter if it remains only two-thirds filled.The goal is to get perspective and clarity. The brain has evolved to be much more sensitive to negatives than positives as, historically, it has been more important for us to be attuned to hazardous situations than satisfactory ones. This “negativity bias” distorts our perspective, meaning it is hard to make a good decision under stress, says Kogan. “People can focus on things that are not ‘as they should be’ … We all have our stories of why we are not happy, at work or otherwise.” But small, practical steps taken to boost joy in one part of life can improve happiness across the board as momentum builds.Kogan’s first tip is to start by writing a list of what you like about your job, no matter how small. “Be specific, think broadly and don’t judge your list as you write it.” It doesn’t matter what they are, or how many there are the idea is to shift your mindset.Kogan suggests making it a daily habit to note three small, highly specific things that you are grateful for every morning, perhaps before you reach for your phone. “It’s not about pretending that nothing is wrong, it’s about helping your brain to get out of that negativity spiral.”Just three weeks of this consistent “gratitude practice” has been shown to establish new neuron connections facilitating optimism, with the effects lasting for six months. Mindfulness and self-compassion are similarly powerful, says Shamash Alidina, the author of Mindfulness for Dummies and the co-founder of the not-for-profit Museum of Happiness – and more attainable than people may think.Many equate mindfulness with clearing one’s mind of thoughts entirely. This means they often give up out of frustration, says Alidina – but “it’s not about not thinking, it’s about being aware”. Spending just a few minutes noticing your thoughts pass you by like clouds, experimenting with what Alidina calls your “flexibility of attention”, can equip you to stop negative spirals before they start. “People associate meditation with being calm or relaxed, but it’s really just about not getting lost in your thoughts,” he says.Finding lasting happiness is also about what we do, particularly what we do for others. Kogan says it is important to have a sense of purpose – to find what she calls “the bigger why” among our deadlines and meetings. “It’s not possible to be a happy human being if you don’t feel like what you’re doing is meaningful,” she says.Assessing your to-do list – particularly tasks you find mundane or frustrating – through the lens of “Who does this help?” can increase motivation, lift your mood and improve your ability to manage stress, she says. “When you say: ‘This project is going to help a lot of people’ – my team, customers, readers, whatever – your stress has context and you feel more resilient getting through it.”Helping others may seem like a circular way of boosting your happiness, but Kogan says even small gestures, such as pulling out a chair for a colleague or checking in with them about their day, releases oxytocin in the giver and the receiver. Over time, it also fosters a sense of belonging at work and can lead to office friendships – one of the most common factors in job satisfaction.The mindset shift encouraged by practising “intentional kindness” means it is worth doing for your own happiness, says Kogan. At 3pm every day, she receives a reminder to “be kind”. Sometimes that is as simple as texting someone she hasn’t spoken to in a while and telling them that she’s thinking of them: “I cannot tell you how much that means to people.”It is well known that strong relationships are important to happiness, but what those look like – and how to forge them – can be ambiguous. “Happiness can feel very abstract,” says Gretchen Rubin, the author of The Happiness Project. “My approach is to think about what you want, then break it up into manageable, concrete actions that you can actually take.”In terms of improving relationships, that might look like making a regular time to call or meet a friend, committing to attend a reunion or throw a party, or having a daily exchange with someone in public. Every five days or so, Rubin’s family email each other an update on the “boring everyday stuff” of their lives, freed from any pressure to entertain or an expectation to reply. “We realised that, by staying in touch with the little minutiae, we would feel more connected – and it’s absolutely working.”Making warm greetings and goodbyes habitual at home is another small but effective shift (“I always think that I don’t want to be less enthusiastic than my dog,” says Rubin). Such low-level commitments are less daunting to start and easier to keep up – and they make a real impact. We all have different definitions of happiness, Rubin says, whether it be joy, peace, satisfaction, bliss. “My way of thinking about it is: today, next month, next year – are there things you can do to be happier?” she says. “And if there are, why not do them?”If Rubin comes across an improvement at home that she can make in less than a minute, she does it immediately. For her, “outer order contributes to inner calm”, so happiness can be as simple as a clean kitchen bench or a decluttered shelf. “It feels trivial – and yet over and over people say: ‘When I have control of my environment, I feel like I have control generally,’” says Rubin. “Like making your bed every morning – it gives people a lift, more than really makes sense.”Often this is understood as minimalism – but there are many happy, successful people who take pleasure in being surrounded by their possessions, says Rubin. It is not a moral failing to prefer abundance, and making your personal space reflect your values and interests “can be very pleasing”.Ingrid Fetell Lee, the author of The Aesthetics of Joy, agrees. “We’ve been taught to think about our homes through the lens of other people: what’s trendy, what the design books say,” she says. As a result, many of us are out of touch with how our spaces measure on our own “joy meters”. We may view a neutral grey palette as the height of sophistication when, in fact, what brings us pleasure is a neon front door.Even the presence of different shapes can have an impact, with people finding angular objects more subconsciously anxiety-inducing than round ones. Rounded objects also tend to make environments more playful, says Lee: “Not only because your mind is unconsciously set at ease, but because you’re less worried about bumping into sharp edges.”Play is an effective mood-booster that is often neglected in adulthood. Rubin says she marks holidays such as Halloween and St Patrick’s Day with themed meals, just because, while the Museum of Happiness’s pop-up installations in London and Manchester later this month are testament to the transformative effects of a ballpit on otherwise sober adults.To bring some of that spirit into your home, Lee advises trying to imagine you are visiting for the first time: “Notice how it makes you feel, almost the physiological sensation in your body, as you move from room to room. What are the things that, when your eyes land on them, make you smile or feel drained?”The key is not to feel burdened by your possessions. “Owning less means you are surrounding yourself with only your favourite things,” says Joshua Becker, who writes the blog Becoming Minimalist. Being intentional with the things that we own – and, by extension, our money – means that our lives align with our values and passions: things that really matter to us. “Minimalism removes distractions so that we can free up our money, time and energy on those things that bring us real joy in life,” says Becker.Play, gratitude and kindness may factor into a life full of joy, but so can discipline. A sense of control is more important to happiness than many people realise, says Rubin. Prosaically enough, this is inextricable from exercise, sleep and good money management. Too often, happiness is located solely in the moment, she says, when it could be achieved through giving up sugar or alcohol, or setting an alarm to go to bed on time. “Sometimes, to be happier in the long run, we have to ask more of ourselves or deprive ourselves of something,” says Rubin. “A happy life is not one that’s focused only on the present.”In the same vein, putting off a difficult or boring task can detract from your daily experience more than getting stuck into it. Waite says she rolls her eyes at the framing of self-care as “baths and candles”: “I love those things, but if doing your tax return is really making you anxious, maybe the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a start.” It may not be what is typically understood by joy, but sustainable, long-lasting happiness involves recognising that there are many shades on the emotional palette.Research shows that occasionally accepting the presence of harder emotions means you experience them less intensely and for less time. In fact, the first step towards a joyful life may be letting go of your ideas of what that looks like – and recognising that it is down to you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/253a53ff66775895f9923f559f90660161e8103b/69_0_2778_1667/master/2778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b30d3945f29c9e2c827e504128b7d21f","title":"surprising psychology behind being perpetually late","story":"There are as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually tardy people – and the underlying reasons can be complexSometimes, one of my psychotherapy clients will be late. “The tube got stuck I do apologise.” If it happens once, I don’t treat it as significant. But some clients are perpetually late – perhaps just five or 10 minutes, but always – and out of breath when they get to the door. Then I am curious about what is behind their pattern of lateness, what it means and what purpose it serves.There are probably as many reasons for unpunctuality as there are habitually late people. Sometimes it seems unfathomable, but not always. One client remembered that his mother always spent so long in the bathroom that she made him late for school. She told him that it didn’t matter, and early people are uptight anyway. In his unconscious, being on time for things had got mixed up with being disloyal to his mother and therefore bad. Once he had found this narrative, he lost his compulsion for lateness.Punctual people may believe that late people are passive-aggressive and that their time is more valuable than those who wait for them. But reasons for lateness are generally more complex. The reason may be the opposite of arrogance. It could be that they don’t value themselves enough. If this is the case, might they be unable to see how others could possibly mind their non-appearance?This explanation may work for social situations, but why miss planes, boats and trains? Perhaps it is an unconscious testing of the theory: “If I were a worthy person, the train would wait for me.” Since it doesn’t, the feeling of not mattering is reinforced.One client I had kept thwarting her own attempts to succeed in her career, and bad time-keeping was part of this. When we unpicked what success would mean to her, she uncovered an old family belief that people with money were evil, bad people. Faced with a choice of not progressing or being evil, it was no wonder she kept up with the self-sabotage programme.Late people often have a sunny outlook. They are unreasonably optimistic about how many things they can cram in and how long it takes to get from the office to the restaurant, say, especially if it is nearby. My book editor and I often have lunch in a cafe next door to her office and she is always seven minutes late, because she leaves at 1pm. I think she believes she possesses a teleporter, yet, by the time she has chatted to a colleague in the lobby and waited for the lift, she is seven minutes late. I am considering getting there seven minutes late myself, except, as an early person with my own set of neuroses, that would make me ill with anxiety.Lateness can also be caused when we have a reluctance to change gear – to end one activity and start another. We don’t like getting up, we put off going to bed. Stopping something we are absorbed in to do something else can be annoying. It takes willpower to carry out. But if we don’t change gear in time when someone is waiting for us, we are in danger of being judged as selfish.Some late people choose to accept that they are terrible timekeepers and that they can’t do anything about it. Yet punctual people think they know that late people could decide to be on time and follow through.It is only when the latecomers make the decision to be punctual that they change. It must be a conscious decision if they merely make a woolly attempt to “try” to be on time, they won’t be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4d3a5e732aa8f5834eff51015163c214db33e49/0_0_8688_5213/master/8688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cabf86cb73b7a85c25fda5736a2aa936","title":"great expectations the quest for perfection has cannibalised my identity","story":"Perfectionism is associated with a long list of psychological disorders, the problem is notoriously hard to treat and it’s on the rise“You need to practice self-compassion,” my psychologist says to me. This is our sixth session, and, as per usual, he is struggling to find a phrase, a point – anything – that will help me move past the need to seek perfection in every part of my life.“Yes, but how?” I ask, again. We talk about the usual techniques: not beating yourself up when you think you’ve failed not automatically falling into a vortex of self-loathing at minor rejections.“This experience does not reflect on you as a person,” he repeats, explaining that what I perceive as abject failure is a mere blip on the horizon, a simple fact of life.I listen hard, I really do. I understand everything he says on an intellectual level, and I want to stop this ever-present stream of self-criticism before it gets too late.The problem is the quest for perfection has cannibalised my identity.Perfectionism is a personality trait, but psychologists classify it as a risk factor for a host of disorders, including (but not limited to) obsessive compulsive disorder, eating disorders, social anxiety, social phobia, body dysmorphic disorder and workaholism.It also confounds treatment. Dr Simon Sherry, a Canadian neuroscience professor and clinical psychologist, tells me perfectionists make for very difficult patients. “It can sabotage treatment at every level.”Perfectionists are often undone at the first stage of therapy, says Sherry. They are reluctant to seek treatment, because to do so would be to admit they have failed. And if they do manage to get themselves in front of a therapist, they tend to have unrealistically high expectations of treatment, making them more prone to giving up before therapy has time to take effect.“They also struggle to play nicely, have intense conflictual relationships with other people and struggle to connect with others,” Sherry explains. “All this can interfere with helping establish the complicated alliance that needs to be built between client and therapist.”Tracey Wade is a professor of psychology at Flinders University, Adelaide, and a leader in the study of perfectionism. When I call her up to talk, she is preparing a training session on how psychologists and therapists can best treat perfectionism.“What usually interferes with perfectionists getting better is that they tend to block therapy,” she tells me. “Clients believe that their therapist is judging them and that they’re not working hard enough in therapy.”According to psychologists Paul Hewitt and Gordon Flett, there are three types of perfectionists: the ‘self-oriented’ type, who keep strict standards for themselves and are motivated by avoiding failure at all costs the ‘other-oriented’ type, who set perfectionist expectations for others and the ‘socially prescribed’ form, who believe that others expect them to be perfect.While people can suffer from a mixture of all three, each type is enough to cause a high level of anxiety on its own.I’ve lost count of how many psychologists I’ve seen over my lifetime. All I know is that it’s roughly an equal number of men and women, aged between 35 and 60.They have ranged from formal and less formal their treatment approaches have varied from cognitive behavioural therapy to experimental exercises designed to reprogram my brain to work for me, rather than against me.Some have given me books others have told me to stop reading into it.“What can I say that will make you feel better?” my current psychologist asked me at our last session. I’d been crying again, and he was running out of ideas how to help me. “You’re supposed to come out of these sessions feeling better, not worse.”“I’m waiting for you to say that one phrase that will make it all click for me,” I replied.“There is no one thing that will help – you have to start small.”I left feeling more frustrated than ever before. In the past, I’d been able to change some of my more destructive habits after having one conversation, so I don’t understand why therapy is not playing along.While perfectionism has always existed, never before have we seen it manifest itself so strongly in one generation. After conducting one of the largest-ever studies on perfectionism, Sherry and his colleague Dr Martin Smith found that perfectionism has increased substantially over the past 25 years, and that it affects men and women equally.“In this new society young people are evaluated in a host of new ways – almost every aspect of their lives is turned into metrics, and they are rated, ranked and tested on every single thing they do, down to how they look.”Perfectionism is also partly genetic, and it is also strongly influenced by the environment a child grows up in.Sherry says that over time, children internalise the conditions put on them by perfectionist parents and then take them into their own relationships.“We need to encourage parents to love their children unconditionally,” he tells me. “We don’t want parents to react catastrophically to minor mistakes that their children make, and see minor mistakes as massive problems.”According to Sherry, loving your children in proportion to their achievements (such as only rewarding them when they get high marks) “over time leads to them internalising these conditions, and then crashing in terms of their self-esteem and mood when they don’t get a promotion, or a sought-after achievement”.This is not just a low mood: people who are perfectionists are at higher risk of suicide, and are more likely drop-out, self-criticise and suffer from a lack of self-compassion.So is there hope?Over time, I’ve come to realise that the biggest obstacle to my own treatment is the belief that perfectionism fuels my ambition. I didn’t take the problem seriously.For years, I wore my perfectionism like a badge of honour: “I strive for perfection,” I told myself, “which means my standards are extremely high and will result in higher quality work.”While I did achieve high results, I’m starting to realise this may be in spite of, and not because of, my perfectionistic tendencies.Wade says that fear is a strong motivator for perfectionists, and that “people are afraid to let it go because of their belief it achieves things for them”.So how do you convince a perfectionist that what they consider to be a ‘high standard’ and ‘being productive’ is actually unattainable?“Most studies and clinical observations show that perfectionism is the opposite of productivity,” Sherry says. “Perfectionists tend to have more episodes of depression, be more absent and are prone to negative emotions such as guilt and anxiety.“Over time, perfectionists may start to unravel – they become less conscientious, organised, disciplined, reliable and goal-focused, and more neurotic and emotionally unstable.”I ask all the experts if there is a way to change the belief that perfectionism is fundamental to success. To truly change it – not just intellectually – but deep within your heart. For Wade, it’s all about changing your mindset from “must” to “it would be nice”.“Research shows that when you start to change your thinking from ‘should’ to ‘it would be nice, but it’s not the end of the world’, it becomes more about excellence rather than perfectionism.”For Hill, it’s about “deriving value in yourself by what you add to others”, and perhaps he’s right. Perhaps shifting the outlook from bettering ourselves to helping others is the ultimate antidote to a society where inidualism – and the insatiable need to be the best – has caused far more harm that we ever anticipated.So as we continue to navigate a system that sets us up for failure – all the while demanding success at every turn – it’s worth asking ourselves: how far are we willing to go to present as the perfect human? And in the end, is it worth it?As someone in the midst of it, I can honestly say no."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d81d2772bf09f0310ec758b57402de8257b2bf75/262_853_4659_2795/master/4659.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6d78a4c2f1c46405d725a34d535503a","title":"new year celebrations around the world in pictures","story":"Revellers have bid farewell to a decade that will be remembered for, among other things, the rise of social media, the Arab spring, the MeToo movement and Donald Trump"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66bd7a52bb97f163933172b988dd2e77c60e8105/0_48_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9972630690aeccad4be06f8c501b840a","title":"how truth gets lost in the bbc search for balance","story":"I’ve long since given up making the effort to formally complain about the BBC’s anti-Corbyn and anti-Labour bias, because whenever I have (and I have done frequently, and in detail), the ultra-defensive robotic response denying any bias has been pitiable.I know others have had a similar experience, so this alone could account for the BBC receiving a larger number of formal complaints about anti-Conservative coverage than anti-Labour (BBC ‘bias’: Tory voters more likely to complain en masse, 31 December). Conservatives are perhaps also more likely to be “anti” the BBC per se, thus generating a greater likelihood of complaints being made.With print media overwhelmingly dominated by rightwing conservative interests, it is essential for democracy that our flagship public-service broadcaster provides some kind of countervailing balance. Historically, this was indeed a role that the BBC discharged reasonably well – being a key factor in the election of a number of Labour governments since 1964. Without a relatively neutral broadcast media, Labour will always start with a massive handicap it has a mountain to climb just to get over the line.It’s just not good enough that, in a year or two, independent academic research reports will conclusively demonstrate the BBC’s anti-Labour bias. When voters’ access to unbiased information is compromised in this way, democracy itself is gravely threatened. For when a government is elected to absolute power, carried over the line by bias and propaganda, its very legitimacy is in severe doubt – with grave implications for the sheer governability of a deeply disgruntled, disenfranchised citizenry.Dr Richard HouseStroud, Gloucestershire• In search of balance, during the recent general election the BBC repeatedly gave too much prominence to the unsupported assumptions of Brexit supporters, the rightwing media and a certain “Downing Street source”, and too little to stating established facts. Opponents of Brexit see bias in the former supporters of Brexit see it in the latter. Based on this, some have attempted to defend the BBC’s recent output by saying that if both sides attack you, you are doing it right. In fact, when one side lies all the time and the other does not, then being attacked by both sides means you are charting a path somewhere between truth and lies, and need to do better.For far too long, the BBC and others made similar mistakes over climate science coverage. The solution is simple – to quote Garry Kasparov: “Just keep repeating the facts. Stop giving equal times to lies.”Dr Richard MilneEdinburgh• Tony Hall would do well to read Prof Steve Jones’s 2011 report on the BBC’s science coverage (Election coverage was not biased, says Hall, 23 December). As noted by Diane Coyle, a former vice-chair of the BBC Trust, which commissioned the report, it highlighted the danger of this false-balance interpretation of its editorial requirement of “due impartiality”. Jones wrote: “Attempts to give a place to anyone, however unqualified, who claims interest can make for false balance” – and the opposite of impartiality.I assume the report was ignored by the BBC’s politics staff because it is about “science”, but wider reading of it might help the BBC’s coverage generally.Philip CunninghamLondon• Join the debate – email • Read more  letters – click here to visit guletters• Do you have a photo you’d like to share with  readers?

But taking a few simple steps can make a huge difference to your happiness – and your performance in the officeWhat would it take to make our working lives better? Steve Jobs once said about work that it was our life’s mission to “do what you love”, but for most of us it is the compromise of “finding what you can put up with”. So, if most of us are never exactly going to love work, what can we do to make it a little less awful?For starters, let’s be honest about what work is like. According to the magazine Management Today, the average Briton spends 16 hours a week in meetings, hostage to the drone of people they vaguely recognise. This is why most of us have learned that to survive in the modern workplace we need to master the “I’m not listening, but want you to think I am” nod, along with the subtle art of checking WhatsApp under a notebook.But there are simple steps we can take to start rebalancing this relationship with our workplace. Researchers have found that even the most miserable job can be redeemed by taking back a little control.When workplace experts study what makes a good day at work, the answers are common sense. We say we have had a satisfying time when we have “made progress in something meaningful”. For many of us, stranded in a vast, open-plan savannah, playing email Tetris, the idea of progress feels unobtainable.This may be because one of the biggest challenges for human brains is switching between activities. Various attempts to measure our attention have suggested that, when we switch tasks, it takes between eight and 20 minutes for our attention to focus fully again.This is where the author Dan Pink has a valuable tip. Pink’s approach is to do one action, his MIT (most important thing), before he does anything else. This way, if the MIT takes up to an hour of concentration, he has made progress on something before the email onslaught begins.Yes, this might be embarrassing to suggest – but if anyone laughs, point out that researchers say going for a walking meeting can be one of the easiest ways to revive your mojo.Interestingly, walking needs to be used appropriately: it is a powerful way to liberate ideas, but it is not the most effective way to resolve complex logical puzzles. The researchers also found that the power of walking lingered after the walk. Taking a stroll before undertaking a creative task fostered a significant uplift compared with staying seated. Other research, from a paper published in 2012, said that going for a 50-minute walk in nature can have a strong effect on our ability to concentrate.Are your colleagues still sniggering? Just ignore them – safe in the knowledge that JK Rowling said night-time walks are the surest way to overcome writer’s block.British workers are well versed in eating al desko, but taking a step away from our workstations for a proper recovery more than pays its way – and not just at work. Psychologists from Baylor University in Texas found a relationship between people skipping lunch breaks and feeling exhausted at the weekend.Despite this, many of us feel a silent pressure to work through lunch. But there is good evidence that stepping away from our desks improves our work, too. Our attention is measurably worse later in the day – a 2006 study of workers at a medical centre in North Carolina found that the likelihood of a medical error occurring was four times higher at 4pm than at 9am. Our afternoon selves, rendered dopey with tiredness, simply are not as effective – and taking a break is one of the best ways to get back some of our zing. Research at Harvard University found that giving schoolchildren five-minute breaks every hour improved their results over the course of a day, whereas a lack of breaks saw their results spiral downwards (with the biggest declines among the least able pupils).If you need more persuading, think about this: skipping an hour’s lunch over the course of a year is the equivalent of five weeks’ holiday. So, make plans to meet a friend or to go to the gym – it could improve your whole week.Researchers at Harvard found that workers were crushed by the daily burden of emails and the need to be contactable at all hours. The worst afflicted were management consultants, who often checked emails if they awoke to go to the loo in the night. Modest changes, such as taking one evening a week off email, were suggested. The management consultants couldn’t quite bear this, so they devised a scheme where one person was always checking night-time emails, while the rest of their colleagues had the evening off. The participants were euphoric. The mere thought of having a night off email duty seemed to have a measurable impact on their stress levels.Bruce Daisley is the European vice-president of Twitter.

Holmes had been booking bands since the age of 15 and McCready was running underground hip-hop nights in the city. “We’re both blessed with a personality of not waiting around for things to happen,” says Holmes. “So we put on our own nights.” On 23 December 1989, the pair launched Sugar Sweet – initially called Base and then briefly The Face – a night that brought acid house and rave culture to Belfast with a mighty thump. Earlier this month, the pair threw a one-off 30th anniversary party to celebrate.Throwing such parties wasn’t straightforward, given the Troubles were still ongoing. Holmes was born in 1969, the same year British troops were first deployed in Northern Ireland (in an operation that lasted until 2007). “We were a Catholic family living in a majority Protestant neighbourhood so we were open targets,” he recalls. “My house was pipe-bombed when I was four. I was in the bath. The Troubles was just a fucking lottery of death – people dying because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.”The combination of political tension, exhilarating new music, euphoric new drugs and a brand new place to experience them was a potent concoction. “Everything was so fresh and raw,” says Holmes. “All week you’re getting searched, there’s roadblocks, it takes three hours to get home – people are being shot on your fucking doorstep. But when you’re living in that moment, you don’t feel that you’re being affected by it.”Holmes and McCready could immediately sense the crowd letting go. “If you spend Monday to Saturday living in fear and paranoia, once you cross into that club and you’re hearing this music from all over the world, while being psychedelically intoxicated, all that shit just disappears,” Holmes says.“The Troubles manifests itself in your psyche in ways that you cannot even understand, so when you’re on that dancefloor and religion isn’t a barrier any more – the atmosphere was just beautiful. There was all this energy released. These communities fucking hated each other but among them you had groups of people whose religion was music.”Many DJs were too scared to come and perform but the likes of Andrew Weatherall and the Dust Brothers (before they became the Chemical Brothers) played. Orbital named their track Belfast in homage. “The Orbital night was insane,” Holmes remembers. “Chime was the anthem at the time and people were crying on the dancefloor – literal tears of happiness. People were becoming incredibly enlightened and having a really serious emotional reaction because of what was going on politically.”Paul Hartnoll of Orbital remembers it as being special. “It was incredible,” he says. “We’d play tracks like Satan and it used to clear dancefloors the length and breadth of the UK. In Belfast everybody stood there with their hands in the air and just roared with excitement.”Hartnoll not only remembers a surging intensity to the crowd but also deep gratitude. “We did our set and we could not leave the stage. People were clambering on to shake our hands and say thanks.” A demo track they had at the time needed a name and the city provided it. “It was to try and give something back to Belfast that reminds us of our lovely time there and the warmth of the people.”The night grew steadily until it filled its 500-odd capacity each month and queues formed to get in. The sound quality was a big pull. “We always had the most amazing soundsystems,” McCready says. “In 1989 to spend over a grand to hire a system was a lot of money. It had to be brought in via an 18-wheeler truck.”Another ace that Sugar Sweet held was access to acid house’s Chicago heartland, thanks to Holmes’s mum. “Due to the Troubles I had a brother who left Belfast for Chicago because his best friend was shot dead on the corner of our street,” Holmes says. “My mum would go and visit him, which was like winning the lottery. She found Gramaphone Records, the best dance music record shop, and she’d bring back all these white labels. I didn’t have a fucking clue what they were – it was proper raw dance music fresh out of Chicago.”Aesthetically, the night was aiming for something like a psychedelic 1960s party. Projections of 16mm films were screened on to the walls, alongside giant weather balloons, and giant custom-made flags. “Although they did end up accidentally looking a bit fascist,” recalls Holmes. “Because of the colour scheme and the SS for Sugar Sweet.”The close-knit music community in Belfast, along with reliable doormen, meant violence was unusual in the club. Nor did it become a magnet for police. “The police were aware and I’m sure they had a few undercover boys in,” McCready recalls. “But the people that were dealing were not operating along sectarian lines. It was people flying to London and buying a few pills to bring back. There was nothing dark or sinister going on in the background – it wasn’t like paramilitaries were running drugs in the place.”Holmes also suggests that while acid house might have been front-page tabloid fodder in England, it was less of a focus in Belfast. “The police had bigger issues on their hands,” he says. “It went largely unnoticed here for a few years because of all the other distractions.”Holmes recalls kick-out time for the club leading to some unusual scenarios. “The lead singer of the Sandals was last seen wandering through Sandy Row, which is a real serious loyalist neighbourhood, wearing a woman’s dress with a lampshade on his head saying ‘peace and love’ to everybody on the street.”The club’s cultural impact went further than the music, says Holmes, who went on to score films by Steven Soderbergh and Michael Winterbottom alongside a string of solo albums. “It inspired so many people who didn’t want to have a real job,” he suggests. “There’s something about that sense of togetherness, especially when you’re staring down the barrel of a gun, that gives you that extra bit of inspiration to think, ‘I want this to be more than once a month – I want it to be my fucking life.’ You can go down a very dark path in Belfast growing up during that time and I think the majority of people who came to this club chose something else.”It had the same impact on Holmes and McCready themselves. “We were going through the same experiences,” Holmes says during a one-off anniversary party to celebrate. “We were having the best nights of our lives. I’ve DJ’d all across the world and none of them have come close to some of those nights at Sugar Sweet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32573a29faa9ce05d1e3aea4130aa850a1bd75a4/0_43_1494_896/master/1494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b62635d5e42fdf7cc780ce9c1230c2","title":"abandoned at sea the cargo crew adrift without wages fuel or supplies a look back","story":"This week we are returning to some of our favourite episodes from 2019.

He is tipped to run for the leadership himself and said in a piece in the Daily Mirror that Labour lost the election because of its position on the EU, infighting in the party and a lack of trust among voters that it could deliver its manifesto promises.Lewis said he did not disagree with Lavery on how much rebuilding the party needed to do and would not be drawn into creating splits on how the party must change.“As such, when you’re hanging by the fingernails on a cliff edge, it’s usually not a good time to start fighting with those dangling with you. Far better is to help each other work out the way back up the cliff face.”Lewis, a former army reservist, was the second Labour MP to announce he wanted to run for leader, following the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry.There are concerns Lewis might split the vote of leftwing members should he make it on to the ballot paper, potentially drawing support away from the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey.Thornberry wrote a lengthy Facebook message about her foreign policy priorities on New Year’s Day, taking a swipe at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson. She has been a regular critic of the US president, branding him a sexual predator and racist, and saying he is not welcome in the UK.She wrote on Facebook: “Finally, I hope in November, our long global nightmare will be over and Donald Trump will be dumped out of office by the American people, and we will finally see the United States resume its role as a global leader on the issues that matter to us all.“What’s more, Trump’s defeat would hopefully turn the tide on his vicious band of so-called ‘populist’ imitators around the globe, including our current PM.”Thornberry regularly faced Johnson at the despatch box in the Commons when he was foreign secretary and has written of the need for someone with confidence and forensic skill to take him on in the chamber."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12fc09030701044d3a2961a0b79a66c973c99f20/0_282_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=374788617e09d1531494ebdb2f655d88","title":"what to expect in 2020 politics weekly podcast","story":"’s political editor, Heather Stewart, rings in the new year and looks at what to expect on the podcast in 2020Follow us on Twitter: @Heather and @DaniS1006"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b75d979e61e6b55514d4aa25b9fcf460792fce53/0_426_2320_1391/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e82c72e142c9898ca25ea4985d297a5e","title":"if you speak multiple languages which words get lost in translation","story":"Share your favourite words or terms that just don’t translateA new study has demonstrated that while words for emotions such as “fear”, “love” or “anger” are often directly translated between languages, there can be differences in their true meaning, depending on the family the language belongs to.For example, while the concept of “love” is closely linked to “like” and “want” in Indo-European languages, it is more closely associated with “pity” in Austronesian languages.The team behind the research say the way particular experiences are interpreted as emotions appears to be shaped by culture.Are there words you know which can be directly translated, yet have subtle differences in meaning?

We’re increasingly experiencing unseasonal heatwaves, dangerous flooding and extreme weather,” explains WWF climate change specialist, Isabella O’Dowd. “The government, businesses and iniduals have an important role to play in reaching the UK’s climate change targets. Right now, people want to know what they can do to help mitigate the effects of climate change.”In the past year, the climate crisis has shifted from 11th place to third place on the list of people’s concerns in WWF’s monthly public opinion poll, just behind the NHS and Brexit. This year has also seen high-profile global youth climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion protests. In addition, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2019 report stresses that it will be impossible to keep global temperatures at safe levels unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced in all sectors, including land and food. As a result, more people recognise that climate breakdown isn’t abstract. It’s not a threat affecting remote communities, or far away in the distant future – it’s happening here and now.The climate and nature crisis is already accelerating so many human-induced influences on our planet – from the destruction of vast areas of rainforest in the Amazon to the collapse of bee populations. As more species become endangered, including one-third of all insects globally, the ecosystems that we all rely on become more fragile.With such astonishing loss of bioersity and habitat, planet Earth is much more likely to reach irreversible tipping points. Environmental breakdown is inevitable if we continue this unsustainable consumption of fossil fuels.Mark Wright, WWF’s director of science, hopes that environmental issues will be at the top of the agenda for political leaders: “Attitudes are shifting and now we need a step-change – the UK government needs to take radical steps to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.”WWF climate experts estimate that net-zero could be achieved much sooner than the current 2050 target if we act now, but that calls for fundamental changes to the UK’s outdated energy infrastructure. Historically, the UK has been one of the biggest emitters and has an important role to fully decarbonise our energy system as quickly as possible. We need to make the energy greener and develop a more resilient smart system, as O’Dowd explains: “Our grid needs to be flexible so it can better manage supply and demand as we transition to more renewable energy. By equipping every home with a smart meter, power can be adjusted on a local and national level so the system is more energy efficient.”O’Dowd describes smart meters as “the enabler”, and they will undoubtedly be integral to the transition towards a low-carbon economy. To facilitate innovation, the government has pledged to offer every home and small business in the country a smart meter in the next few years – to date about 15.6m smart meters have been installed nationwide. “Smart meters allow consumers to understand their own energy use, and, with information from the in-home display, customers can start making small, money-saving changes such as switching off appliances which aren’t in use.”The government estimates that £650m of energy gets wasted in the current distribution system, travelling from where it is generated to the point it reaches our homes. Smart meters can help reduce loss in energy by accurately forecasting demand and using more low-cost and renewable energy. “We need to ramp up our wind power and solar generation in order to reach our 2050 target of net-zero, but these renewables don’t have an easy route to market,” says O’Dowd. “We want to push the government to raise its ambition – we know the technology exists and solutions are there but we need government support and its investment in our grid network to help that transition.”Ultimately, a smart energy system will generate, distribute and use energy much more efficiently. At a national network level, a more flexible infrastructure will use energy storage, for example via batteries or heating, and will shift demand away from peak periods, because when demand is highest, more of the electricity we consume is generated by polluting coal stations.In conjunction with the University of Oxford, Environmental Defense Fund Europe, and WWF, the National Grid has created a carbon intensity forecast that predicts the generation mix for the next four days in each region of the country. Energy users can enter their postcode and find out when the best time is to access green, clean energy. If your washing machine has a timer, you can set it to run at night, for example, when demand is low and more of the system’s energy is generated by renewables. In homes with solar panels, it might make sense to use electricity at midday if the sun is shining.As the smart energy system becomes more interactive with advanced technology, smart meters will play a part in allowing the shift to more staggered night-time charging for electric car batteries to minimise carbon emissions and keep costs down. In the future, this management could become automatic, with more widespread “time-of-use” tariffs. Local peer-to-peer trading could become more commonplace so consumers could more easily trade the excess energy they generate from solar panels. And perhaps the carbon intensity forecast might one day be reported alongside the weather.The Committee on Climate Change states that to reach our 2050 net-zero emissions target, we must reduce our carbon emissions by 15m tonnes a year, every year, starting now. “We’re in a rapidly changing world in terms of bioersity loss, habitat destruction and climate change, so we’re heading into uncharted territory,” says Wright. “We are clever and technologically savvy, so we may be able to cope with what the world throws at us in the future, but is that a world we want?” he asks, adding that as the climate changes, we’ll need to adapt quickly.For WWF, adopting smart meters is just one of the small changes we can each make, that our power companies do for us, that will help the overall system. It adds that smart meters help us to make changes to our power use – at a national, regional and domestic level – in ways that help cut emissions, which we need to do rapidly and deeply if we are to tackle the climate emergency.Wright says: “To feed the growing population in a world with more extreme weather events, increased flooding and rising sea temperatures, we’ll have to farm crops differently – we might need to start growing novel varieties of crops that are better suited to the environments of the future.” In order to have this capacity to adapt, we need to protect bioersity, on land and in the sea – every species plays a vital role in these ecosystems.“Nature rewards the patient – every species has a story to tell, even little beetles and velvet worms. If you allow nature to tell you its stories, you’ll unravel a real tapestry of life. We will be poorer if we continue to unpick that.”Part of Britain’s commitment to creating a more sustainable, low-carbon future includes making our energy network “smarter” – implementing digital tech to make our energy system more responsive to increased demand and variable wind speed. By collecting data on our energy use through smart meters, our network can better understand, plan for and balance out peaks and troughs in demand, making it easier to integrate renewable energy sources.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB, a government-backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the smart meter rollout."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01c1b4657ba7312bd0e8d362a78ac39d9426539a/0_182_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af5ec0d8b58a897edb1fd389ca058787","title":"my house would only let good people in how kids see their homes of the future","story":"From houses that speak to you to magnifying glasses on the roof for energy, we take a glimpse into the future through the eyes of our youngest generation Fynn Rodell, 11: ‘The sun will heat my oven’I’m going to have loads of tech on my house to make it carbon neutral. I’ll have a wind turbine on the roof to generate electricity for lighting. There will be solar panels on the front door for more energy, and a magnifying glass on the roof to focus the sun’s heat for my oven. A vent will help suck the heat in and spread it around the house for extra heating when I’m not cooking. There will be a smart meter in the house to see how much energy I’m creating and how much I’m using.I’ll grow plants on the roof for insulation, to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and for insects to live there.The turbine on the roof will also power a water cleanser, so I can turn rainwater into drinking and washing water. I’ll have a toilet vacuum like on an airplane so that I don’t waste much water.Rosabela O’Selle-Goncalves, seven: ‘My house will say good things to you if you help the environment’In my house of the future the door should be brown, the house should be peach, and the roof should be red. There wouldn’t be much made from plastic, because if the plastic gets in the rivers it kills the animals.If you do really good things the house will see it and say good things about you because you’re helping the environment. It might say bad stuff if you ruin the environment, or it won’t speak to you.I would like that to happen – it’d be very nice for the house to look and speak to you because it’ll make you feel happy.My house would be medium-sized and you wouldn’t need keys, it would open if I put my hand on the door, but if a stranger put their hand on it, it wouldn’t open. It would know if people coming to the house were good or bad and would only let good people in.It wouldn’t have loads of food because it’s bad for the environment to waste it. To get water you don’t turn a tap on, you press a button and tell it how much water you want. When I walk in the lights will go on and if I leave they go off.Indy Williams, six: ‘Animals that have lost their habitats can come and live with us’In the future, my house will have solar panels on the roof to generate electricity for the TV, maybe a wind turbine too. We’ll still have our pet cats, but if other animals have lost their habitats then they can come and live with us as well. There’ll be a sliding door to the garden where we keep our bikes and also grow tomatoes, cucumbers and pomegranates.In the winter, all the inside walls will be covered in sheep’s wool so the house will be all cosy, like the inside of a slipper. We’ll have small windows and very big windows because it’s nice to have lots of sun, but not when you’re asleep. In the summer we’ll have a street party where no one will smoke or use plastic.Arianna Burke, nine: ‘A robot will sense when you’re wasting energy’I believe environmentally friendly homes of the future will have light switches that switch off in an hour or two when no one is inside.I think there would also be some sort of robot that senses if devices like the TV are on and knows whether people are there or not, and if not, it switches them off. I also think all houses should have solar panels on them automatically when they are built.Rai Rodell, nine: ‘I’ll collect rainwater for animals to drink’I’m going to have lots of animals in my house and in my garden. I’m going to grow food in the garden for me and my animals, and some seeds for the birds. I’ll put bird boxes on the roof so they have somewhere to live.The balcony will shelter the outdoor animals when it rains.

Writers, artists and adventurers share their ideas for kickstarting the year aheadThe important thing on New Year’s Day – as on most days over Christmas – is to get out. If you don’t manage it by about midday, suddenly it’s dusk and too late.Living in Cornwall makes you a sitting target for visitors, and we normally have an assortment of friends and family packed into our house. There’s a favourite cove a few miles away, behind Nare Head. It’s hard to see from the track above, and the squelchy route down and the cliff-scramble mean that, even in summer, there’s rarely anyone else there. The bay is a great gatherer of driftwood (as well as less-flammable flotsam – random shoes, gloves, bath toys, broken fish boxes and cobles…). We build a fire and drink hot soup and cook sausages. If there’s a swell running, and the tides are low, some of us will tug on wetsuits and boots and try the surf – others might dash in for a new year’s baptismal dip.To one side of the beach, the cliff has been cut into, forming gullies – or “zawns”, from the Cornish. You can swim into these and feel the sea surge in and rise and fall against the rocks while you bob, cork-like, upon them, contemplating the ups and downs of the coming year.• Philip Marsden’s most recent book is The Summer Isles: A Voyage of the ImaginationThe flanks of Dartmoor are always whitened with frost and hidden icicles on new year’s morning. This is where I set out to, with snow boots, flasks of hot tea and my loved ones.Often, we make our way up to Wistman’s Wood. This grizzled place is one of the few original ancient oak woods left on the moor, and it feels enchanted. From a distance, its furze of stunted oaks set among the clutter of granite boulders looks unremarkable, but inside is a muscular wood-world of moss boulders and ankle-turning tangles of trunks, roots and loopy beards of lichen.Here, we sit in the stillness between weather patterns and think about our resolutions – what the old year has been and what we wish for the new. Among the trees, we listen to the high, glassy crepitation of twigs conversing from their coatings of ice, poised for the next incoming skitter of cold.There is something safe about a wood in winter: its spacious leaflessness allows you to see your way out, and in the “dimpsey” light we drink steaming tea and watch shadows move around us. Wistman’s Wood is a sheltering place – very slightly uncanny, and good for invoking wishes – but not one in which to linger too long.• Miriam Darlington is author of Otter CountryMelissa Harrison, nature writer and novelistFor the decade between my mid-twenties and mid-thirties, I missed every single New Year’s Day.Often I was out dancing and doing shots and chatting nonsense with friends and strangers: in a dark, windowless club, perhaps, or at a raucous house party with all the blinds drawn. Sometimes I spent it spark out under a duvet, recovering from the night before. Either way, the day just didn’t exist for me: events like the Oxford Street sales, or London’s New Year’s Day Parade, were purely mythical. I never even saw the sun.Another decade on and things are different. Since moving to Suffolk, I’ve made a point of going for a proper walk on 1 January so I can think, and feel, and breathe, and see the new year in.More than once on my rambles I’ve come across people botanising, which may seem unlikely given the time of year. But it turns out the New Year Plant Hunt, now nine years old, is fast becoming A Thing: volunteers across the country head out and record whatever’s flowering at nyph.bsbi.org, the results analysed by the Botanical Society of Britain \u0026amp Ireland to shed light on our changing weather.It seems to me a powerful ritual, as well as providing useful data: like the clubs I’ve left behind, it’s a quest for life and promise and colour at the chill, drab turning of the year.• Melissa Harrison’s All Among the Barley won the European Union Prize for Literature in 2019On 1 January at Holyrood Park in Edinburgh you might expect to see families taking a refreshing stroll, or folks walking off hangovers from their big night. But you will be surprised: hundreds of Lycra-clad triathletes will be thundering through the park, cycling and running. Yes it is likely to be cold, wet and windy, possibly even snowy, but for 25 years the park has hosted a sprint-distance triathlon – there have been Olympic- and world-level athletes out on course alongside many hundreds of first-time triathletes. Each year, around half the field are first-timers, and in the past few years the number of women competing has overtaken the men.The swim is over 400 metres indoors at the Royal Commonwealth Pool (breaking ice on the local lochs is just a step too far). Then the hardy souls take to their bikes for a three-lap, 10-mile route around Arthur’s Seat, with a substantial hill to be climbed on each lap. Lastly, it’s one more run around the park, before heading for the finish line to be rewarded with a medal and to bask in the glory of becoming a New Year’s Day triathlete.• edinburghtri.orgMidnight: a beach and a driftwood fire, South Skye or west coast Mull. Starlight, moonlight, then the aurora. Then listen. To the night, to the sea, to the voices of the winter dark.Grey seals singing as the tide ebbs and frees the haul-out rocks. Owl-to-owl call, kee-wick to whoo-oo. Then try and count the owls. Fox, triple bark (the dog), mating season scream (the vixen, hair-raising).

And listen to the fire talking to itself through the wee hours, and to each other.The tenor of New Year’s Day is established between the hours of midnight and sunrise.Then, stir the fire, make porridge, and through the daylight hours walk the island until you find an unplanned destination (you know it when you get there).Then, a cottage with the sea across the street.

Oh, she knows, she knows.• Jim Crumley’s latest book is The Nature of SpringBecause I am a ritual sun ray-gatherer – particularly at this winter solstice time of year, when the sun’s early descent is so fiery and intense – my lone spirit plus dog will long for the hills on New Year’s Day. My children and I raise our heads above the parapet of festive fugs. The coast will be clear. We’ll turn away from the glistening sea to head inland to elevations west of the Folkestone Downs near Peene Quarry or Etchinghill.For a while we’ll walk and talk. Then, from across the flow and glow of golden-flanked Down, we’ll be dazzled by an ever-changing veil of rose-tinted ambers and yellows that sweep across our vision, till the orb, departed behind Summerhouse and Tolsford Hills, turns the once-gilded grasses white and colourless in the not-yet-dark.Jade and Dan Scott, adventure guidesNew Year’s Day for us isn’t about making up guilt-ridden resolutions as punishment for indulging in too many mince pies it’s an opportunity to pause and look back at the year behind, to celebrate all the little wins in life and all the happy moments that we made happen for us and others – to remind ourselves of what makes us who we are and what we need to keep doing in the future to keep happy.We like to be with our favourite people, doing simple things, sharing time in nature, no big gestures. We gather up family and friends and head down the South West Coast Path to one of our special places, Pondfield Cove, at Worbarrow Bay beneath the watchful eye of Worbarrow Tout. This is the smaller and lesser-known beach of the two that our children like to think is their own secret cove, and we like to let them think that..We light fires and play pirates, search for sea glass and driftwood, seaweed and wild herbs. We cook a warming stew over the flames and eat it out of tin mugs. The kids get filthy and run free and there’s always one mad person in the party who can’t stay out of the sea!• Jade and Dan Scott run sea kayaking and bushcraft courses in Dorset, foreadventureFor the past few years I’ve spent New Year’s Day on the south coast of Ireland. Egged on by my adventurous cousins, this is where I first got a taste for winter swimming. The first day of the year always involves a swim off Goat Island, in County Waterford, as sausages cook in the sand.Last August I decided to make Dover my home. I moved into a Regency crescent by the castle and from here I can see the waves crash into the harbour below. To beat creeping feelings of isolation I started tentatively dipping myself into the sea but as autumn has turned to winter these outings have become a necessary daily fix, where no day feels complete without a half-hour swim in the Channel.I now structure my work hours around tide timetables and, come rain or shine, I clip on my fluorescent tow float, pull on my neoprene gloves, and roll into the waves. Often going in naked – to titillate the looming border patrol – I dodge the ferries and aim for France. Every day feels like New Year’s Day.Kate Rew, founder of The Outdoor Swimming SocietyI like a good time but New Year’s Eve has always been too much pressure for my wayward ways. I prefer New Year’s Day. I like starting the year relatively fresh, and ending the day in a clean bed, beaten and battered by exertion and weather. At some point I generate inconceivably long lists that boil down to “get fit, drink less, write something and do yoga”.Maximum time outside is different every year. Three years ago my husband and I double-dipped, first in fancy dress at the Lyme Lunge in Lyme Regis, Dorset, then under a supermoon. Two years ago we walked up and down Sugarloaf mountain in Monmouthshire. Last year we cycled what felt like the whole of Somerset.A swimmer I know puts her resolutions in a frame in the downstairs loo, so she (and everyone else) can see them. This year I’m doing the same, which is already making me reframe them in other ways. The same four core points will undoubtedly be the same, but I’m 50 now and this year – this year! – those dreams are coming true.• To find a New Year’s swim, see outdoorswimmingsocietyNew Year’s Eve is my worst night of the year. I always feel like I’m in the wrong place, or not having enough fun. By contrast, New Year’s Day is my favourite. I love the quiet, the sense that the world has temporarily fallen still. I’ve developed a tradition of using it to plan next year’s planting in my garden.First I walk at Wandlebury Park in the Gog Magog Hills in Cambridge, through the neglected orchards of a former stately home, and then I settle down with tea and the last of the sausage rolls, and sort through seed catalogues, sketching out border designs in my battered garden diary. My favourite is the austere Chiltern Seeds, which has no pictures, only wonderfully vivid and knowledgeable mini-essays.I love old-fashioned cottage garden plants: opium poppies, sweet peas like Black Knight and King Edward VII, candy-striped cosmos and tagetes. But like the Talented Mr Ripley, my true passion is for dahlias, especially the ones that look like sea anemones. It’s the best kind of dreaming to do at the hinge of the year, an investment in summer that always comes good, no matter what else 2020 might bring.• Olivia Laing’s collected essays, Funny Weather, is published by Picador in AprilRichard Skelton and Autumn Richardson, writers and musiciansOn New Year’s Eve we usually make a list of aspirations for the coming year, as well as reflecting on those of the year just gone. We often try to spend at least part of New Year’s Day trying to put those objectives into practice: beginning a new piece of writing, art or music. We also try to get outdoors, and for the past two winters we’ve been in the Scottish Borders, living close to Liddel Water — the river that further downstream forms the boundary between Scotland and England. There’s a path along its edge that we like to walk, skirting a threshold as we cross over into a new year.• corbelstonepressI feel fresher if I’ve written down all the unhelpful and hurtful things that my mind has accumulated over the year (harsh and unkind things said to my face, online or behind my back, including things I’ve said about myself), then gone to a river, a forest or garden – in London this will be Regent’s Park or Victoria Park – and burned them like a pile of paper grudges. This ritual helps me move forward, otherwise I become a wheel that has accumulated too much from old roads and I’ll never let them go. I go for long walks alone and listen to music with no lyrics: jazz, dance, funk, electronic, dub. Then I roll into the new year with friends and family and food – ackee and salt fish, and if dessert is going, it’s apple crumble and custard.• raymondantrobusLooking for a holiday with a difference?

But the CIA have other ideasIs he the messiah? Or is he a very naughty boy?These are the animating questions of the 10-part Netflix drama Messiah, a political thriller built around the advent in Syria of a young preacher man (played with grace, charm and passion by Mehdi Dehbi).He catches people’s attention by fearlessly urging them to set aside old isions and listen to his message of peace, love and unity, which seems to incorporate the best of most of the main religions. This is very generous of him, considering he also possesses a set of cheekbones upon which he could hang a new and very self-centred one. For what I suspect are a variety of spiritual, aesthetic and carnal reasons, his following soon grows in numbers.However, the CIA (particularly the agent Eva Geller – played by Michelle Monaghan – who is recently widowed and nursing a secret, possibly fatal, illness, because non-prophets are also interesting) is sceptical. Alongside assorted other cynical parties, the intelligence agency is not convinced that he is our saviour newly born to Earth. It runs him through its databases and finds no trace of him, but reckons he can only be either a con artist or a terrorist who has found a new way to bring about a war.The latter view looks increasingly probable as our lord of the cheekbones leads a group of Muslim refugees out of Damascus, after (as they come to see it) conjuring a sandstorm that spikes the guns of Isis just as they are about to take the city, and up to the border of Israel.He is arrested by the police and interrogated by Aviram (Tomer Sisley), a soldier in the Israeli army. The prophet seems to have unwarranted knowledge of his personal history. As a result, Aviram deletes the tape of their interview. This comes back to bite him when the high priest of the zygomatic arch pulls off his second apparent miracle and escapes from a locked cell overnight.After only a brief pause at Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem – to preach the maxillofacial word and heal a boy shot in front of him by trigger-happy police excited to be closing in on their escapee – the prophet next appears in the US, seemingly having saved a pastor’s daughter from a tornado (and indirectly preventing the debt-ridden pastor from torching his church for the insurance). The seeds of another following are sown. Unsurprisingly, the CIA is no more keen on the home-soil outpost than it was on the original.As the series goes on, the influence of social media and investigations into the potentially holy one’s motivations by old-fashioned “proper” journalists (represented by Jane Adams, playing a dogged CNN reporter called Miriam Keneally) add further layers of complexity. The whole thing is like Homeland, with a ine twist.However, the twist may already have been spoiled. Muslim Arabic speakers have complained that one of the names the writers have used for Zygoman translates as something that gives away the ending a hazard, these people say, of the writers borrowing names and iconography from a religion and a culture they don’t fully understand.Whether this is the case, or an elaborate multiple bluff is in play, Messiah is potent stuff packed with fine performances. My feeling is that, even if the show’s creators had only a basic understanding of the relevant religious and cultural considerations, the mistake being asserted by viewers would be quite difficult to make. I hope that the people behind a multicultural series that deals with Jewish and Muslim conflict had the sense to hire all sorts of experts to protect sensitivities and highlight potential problems – but perhaps I am being overly optimistic.Even in the earliest episodes, Messiah is capable of delivering gut punches – the flashback to Aviram holding a cloth over a boy’s face as he struggles for breath, for example – that surprise you into noticing how far you have been sucked in. Perhaps the fact that the show becomes so harrowing so fast, and is compelling throughout, is a sign that we are hardwired for hope – the man standing in front of me promises to end all human suffering – and programmed deeply to seek answers and invest in those who purport to provide them. I have no saviour to turn to, and if one appeared I would probably be among the very last converts, sitting canker-hearted as water jug after water jug was turned to wine. But I believe in television, and I believe in Netflix’s latest offering to us. Salvation from the outside world for at least 10 hours lies within."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50e9eccf6a7032550569302312335391f32ecc8d/0_138_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3830dfff8fa2ce99e643883957594a6","title":"us elections 2020 democratic candidates","story":"Biden is too gaffe-prone Sanders and Warren are too far left Buttigieg, too young. But which one is capable of beating Trump?Democrats overwhelmingly agree that their top priority in 2020 is to remove Donald Trump from office. But which of the many Democrats running for president is best suited to the task remains a source of deep anxiety and ision less than five weeks before the Iowa caucuses.After more than a year of campaigning, the Democratic presidential primary enters the final sprint before voting begins on 3 February in Iowa in a familiar but fluid state: Joe Biden in the lead, trailed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren with Pete Buttigieg also showing signs of strength in the early states.Democrats fear Biden is too old, gaffe-prone and does not excite the activist base. They also worry Sanders and Warren are too far left and will alienate moderates. And they worry Buttigieg is too young and inexperienced.“Suddenly every candidate has clay feet. Voters are worried. There is no perfect candidate but there never is,” said Elaine Karmack, a veteran of Democratic presidential campaigns who studies primaries as a scholar at the Brookings Institution.Fear of another Trump election has turned Democrats into self-professed pundits, determined to suss out the most “electable” candidate. The perception that Biden is best placed to beat Trump, at least among some voters, has strengthened his resilience despite a series of stumbles and controversies. A central thesis of Biden’s campaign – which he increasingly states in blunt terms on the campaign trail – is that he is the candidate most likely to reassemble a Democratic coalition by appealing to white working class voters who Trump won over in 2016 and to black voters who are critical to the Democratic base.But rising in second place is Sanders, who rebounded from a heart attack in October and sinking poll numbers earlier this year. His “comeback” has reinforced – and even expanded – his standing among the party’s left wing after months of watching Warren rise to to the front of the pack.The policy debate and jostling between the party’s many factions has framed much of the contest until this point. Biden and Sanders, the only candidates to have previously run for president, represent the ideological poles of the primary field – and two competing theories of how to beat Trump.Biden argues Trump is an aberration who can be defeated by the election of a president with the goodwill and experience to unite the country and restore the nation’s standing abroad. Sanders believes Trump is a symptom of an American political system and economy warped by money, greed and inequality. In his view, rooting out Trumpism will require not only a Democratic president but sweeping political and economic reforms.The ide over which path to take in 2020 has emerged as a central fault line in the Democratic race.“In this primary we must commit to being aspirational – to really explain what we expect the next president to build not just by refuting what Trump has done but by building a vision for a future that comes after Trump,” said María Urbina, the national political director for progressive group Inisible. “If you’re not excited to vote for somebody, your neighbors and your friends – everyone who we need to turn out this election to beat Trump’s turnout machine – are probably not going to be very excited to vote for them either.”Warren rose steadily last summer to the top of the field with a registry of plans that would fundamentally remake the US economy but she has receded in recent months amid criticism over her health care proposal. Warren and Sanders, ideological allies whose supporters overlap, are now tangled up for second and third place. Progressive groups are taking sides even as the candidates refuse to go after one another out of fear of antagonizing the other’s supporters, which one of them would need to consolidate to win the nomination.Moderates, meanwhile, are hopeful that the two will ide the left and keep each other from capturing the nomination. But after years of losing factional feuds, progressives are emboldened by their political prominence in the race.“The beauty of having more than one progressive candidate in the race is that they have a large, strong base and they have the resources and infrastructure to go all the way into the 2020 calendar year,” said Rebecca Katz, a liberal political consultant. “It’s possible we could be in a situation where they are two of the last candidates standing – and that’s a good thing for the progressive movement.”Even as polling paints a steady picture of the primary race, the contest remains far from settled.Perhaps one of the biggest uncertainties is Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor who entered the race in late November. His strategy for winning the nomination is unorthodox: he won’t contest the early states that every other candidate is scrapping over. Instead, he has poured tens of millions of dollars from his personal fortune into TV and digital advertising into the big, delegate-rich Super Tuesday states going to the polls on 3 March.But there is plenty of time for other surprises before then.One of the most significant developments in the race so far came in November, when Kamala Harris, a US senator from California and the only black woman running for president, abruptly ended her campaign. Her departure sparked a debate among Democrats over how the most erse primary field in political history has stratified into a top-tier of only white and mostly male candidates.No candidate of color has yet qualified for the next debate in January in Iowa, as the first voters prepare to actually cast their ballots. But the Democrats will now have to compete for media attention with the Senate impeachment trial expected in January. For the senators running for president, this will require time off the campaign trail and in Washington to participate as jurors in the trial.Several candidates have staked their campaigns on a strong finish in Iowa, including Buttigieg, Sanders and Amy Klobuchar, the US senator from Minnesota. Biden’s team has signaled that it has low expectations for Iowa. Instead, Biden expects to pull ahead in South Carolina, where he maintains a strong base of support among black voters.﻿On the campaign trail and the debate stage, the candidates will make their closing arguments to voters. After months of debating policy and politics, their final pitches are expected to focus on the issue that matters most to Democrats: why they are the party’s best hope of beating Trump.“Right now, the biggest priority for Democratic voters is who can beat Donald Trump,” said Michael Starr Hopkins, a Democratic strategist who previously worked on John Delaney’s 2020 presidential campaign.“It’s not the whole game but it’s the most important part of it because if you thought what Trump did in his first term was bad, imagine what he is capable of in a second term.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85ea2d700ca650d1b8045ead99d9c539d431be60/0_16_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad934410504ff003288b6d3c61c5ebf1","title":"what are your hopes for the next decade","story":"As the end of the year approaches, we want to hear what you hope the next 10 years will bringAs 2019 draws to a close, we want to find out your hopes, dreams and desires for the next decade.The 2010s have provided the world with an array of defining challenges: from the rise in political populism to the fight against the climate emergency.

But after she signed a retraction statement 10 days later, she was charged and a dozen men aged between 15 and 22 who had been arrested over the incident freed.Her mother said the woman, who had been due to begin university in September, was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hallucinations and sleeping for up to 20 hours a day as a result of the condition hypersomnia.During a five-month trial, the Briton claimed she had been forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police, telling the judge she was “scared for my life”. On Monday, she was ruled by a judge to have wilfully indulged in public mischief.The teenager, who spent a month in Nicosia general prison before being bailed at the end of August, has been prevented from leaving Cyprus since July. She could face up to a year in prison and a €1,700 (£1,500) fine when she is sentenced on 7 January.Within hours of the court decision being announced, calls for a boycott appeared on social media. The storm erupted as Britain’s Foreign Office, in a highly unusual step, also raised “serious concerns” over the woman receiving a fair trial.On Monday judge Michalis Papathanasiou, sitting in Famagusta’s district court, pronounced that prosecutors had proved her guilt beyond reasonable doubt.The verdict has also put the government of President Nicos Anastasiades on the defensive.As one of the region’s most popular destinations, with an economy greatly dependent on the tourist industry, calls for a boycott have taken the affair to another level. UK tourists top the league tables of arrivals, and Politis, a leading daily, described the Mediterranean country as being “up against the wall”.But while the government spokesman, Kyriakos Kousios, expressed sympathy for the Briton’s mother, he also described public reaction to the case as “exaggerated”.The island nation’s court system, like its judiciary, was entirely independent of the state mechanism, the spokesman insisted. As a former crown colony, Cyprus’s legal system is based on British law.“As a government we cannot, under any circumstances, intervene in a pending case before the court,” he said, repeating that court proceedings were initiated only after the student retracted her original complaint. “What would happen if a Cypriot was brought before a court in the UK? Would the government intervene and would the Cypriots campaign to boycott England?” he asked.Her lawyers have argued that, in contravention of EU community law, a statement retracting the rape claim was signed by the teenager with no lawyer present and after eight hours of police interrogation that was neither videoed nor recorded. Determined to clear her name, they have vowed to take the case to Cyprus’s supreme court and, if necessary, the European court of human rights.On Monday Papathanasiou argued that, motivated by anger, the teenager had falsely levelled the rape claim against the Israelis, when she realised video clips of her having consensual sex with one of them had been recorded by others in the group on their mobile phones.Her testimony before the court had been “evasive” and “contradictory”, he said. Protesters, led by women activists, have deplored the judgment, calling it the product of a system that remains insensitive to gender and rape.As condemnation of the verdict spreads, so does internal dissent over the way the case has been handled. On Tuesday a former attorney general, Alekos Markides, added to the criticism, saying the matter should have been wrapped up long ago instead of assuming such international proportions. “It should have ended with the one-month prison sentence and not assumed such dimensions,” he told a local radio station.As an offence, causing public mischief was among the lightest on the statute books, he said. Blaming the international outcry on the court’s obstinacy, he also criticised the legal system for targeting “a 19-year-old tourist who we have kept in Cyprus for five months now, a … girl who has a clean criminal record … who we have forced to collect donations to cover her legal costs and have forbidden from travelling to her country. This rigidity of the court has provoked reaction internationally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5df3f91d11cc92fd02293bd51fa76647e50a8af/0_14_2900_1740/master/2900.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8690f5e1b91f2d486e84e02a92dee90b","title":"huge rise in number of people trying to cross channel to uk by sea","story":"French officials say more than 2,300 people wer picked up last year, up from 586 in 2018The number of people making desperate attempts to cross the Channel by sea from France has quadrupled over the last year.French officials say almost 2,358 people were picked up in the Channel attempting to reach the UK by boat or swimming in 2019, compared with 586 in 2018.In total in 2019 there were 261 crossings or attempted sea crossings, mostly by small, overloaded inflatable craft, leading to four deaths. Fifty-five percent of the attempts were unsuccessful. The most desperate attempted to swim the Channel, which is 20.7 miles across at its narrowest point.On Tuesday more than 40 migrants, including eight children, were intercepted in the Channel by the Border Force. Dozens more, including a pregnant woman, were picked up in the Channel in the days after Christmas.On New Year’s Eve an inflatable craft, carrying six males with hypothermia, according to French rescuers, was intercepted after getting into difficulty nearly seven miles (11km) north of Dunkirk. The migrants were taken to Calais.In the last year, the number of attempted crossings has soared despite repeated warnings from the French authorities and migrant support organisations of the danger in the Channel, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, from traffic, strong currents and icy water.After meeting the British home secretary, Priti Patel, in August, the French interior minister, Christophe Castaner, said it was in both countries’ interests to stop “irregular crossings” of the Channel.The Home Office said patrols on French beaches had doubled and drones, specialist vehicles and detection equipment had been deployed to deter crossings. It said it had sent back 125 illegal migrants who had arrived by sea in 2019 to show its “determination” to return those entering the country illegally to Europe where they should seek asylum.Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, said France needed to do more to stop boats setting off from its coast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce2277ef0b22f01ecc3d165afbb7c55408d2bf6/0_886_4222_2535/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e43d0445e8bafe867e32ca3d700ab9b6","title":"mexico amlo el chapo same power past presidents corruption","story":"López Obrador took a blow at his predecessors while claiming Mexico’s era of corruption is ‘gone to the garbage dump of history’Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, closed out 2019 with a parting shot at his predecessors, saying the imprisoned drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera had once wielded the same power as the country’s president.In a video message from the southern city of Palenque on Wednesday, López Obrador recounted his administration’s successes in its first year and highlighted its challenges foremost surging violence.He claimed without offering any evidence that he had already done away with the high-level corruption that was rampant in previous governments, but said it was crucial to draw a bright line between criminal elements and authorities so that the two sides do not mingle as they had in the past.“There was a time when Guzmán had the same power or had the influence that the then president had ... because there had been a conspiracy and that made it difficult to punish those who committed crimes. That has already become history, gone to the garbage dump of history,” López Obrador said.It appeared to be a reference to the indictment and arrest last month of Mexico’s former public safety secretary Genaro García Luna. García Luna was public safety secretary in Felipe Calderon’s Cabinet from 2006 to 2012. Before joining Calderon’s government, García Luna led Mexicos equivalent of the FBI, the Federal Investigative Agency, under Vicente Fox.He was charged in federal court in New York with three counts of trafficking cocaine and one count of making false statements. He had been living in Florida and was arrested in Texas.US prosecutors allege he accepted millions of dollars in bribes from Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel and in exchange allowed it to operate without interference.Guzmán was convicted on drug conspiracy charges in New York. He was sentenced this year to life in prison.López Obrador came to power a year ago promising a “hugs not bullets” approach of tackling the social roots of crime instead of confronting the cartels head-on.But his vaguely defined strategy has itself come under intense criticism after a string of high-profile violent crimes, including an ambush which killed 13 state police officers, the murder of nine members of a US-Mexican family and the humiliating release of one of Guzmán’s sons after cartel gunmen besieged an entire city after he was briefly detained."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3b1f9ea06fffaba52b8b0d8cb51058e9772f6a6/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83e0472b4642248fa7411ad1a6105106","title":"new years day rally hong kong","story":"Police detain 400 and fire teargas as anti-government protests continue into 2020A huge New Year’s Day march in Hong Kong has ended in mass arrests and street clashes as the anti-government movement – now in its eighth month – continued into 2020.Police detained about 400 people on charges including illegal assembly and possession of offensive weapons after the rally on Wednesday, which organisers said was attended by more than a million people. It was one of the largest numbers of arrests in a single day since the unrest began.But the march had begun in a mood of carnival celebration – there were protesters in costumes and families with children and elderly people. Marchers chanted slogans including “Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our era”.Riot police fired teargas rounds in Wan Chai district after protesters threw objects at officers who had arrested several people for allegedly vandalising a bank.Some protesters retaliated by throwing molotov cocktails at the police, but many in the crowd were caught by surprise as the march was expected to be peaceful and most did not wear protective gear.Police demanded that the protest organisers, the Civil Human Rights Front, immediately call off the demonstration, but large crowds continued to march and police declared that they were taking part in an illegal assembly.As night fell, police used water cannon on crowds in Wan Chai and the financial district of Central. Protesters laid bricks across the main thoroughfare in Central in an attempt to impede the police’s advance towards the area.A police statement said protesters had blocked roads with barricades, dug up bricks from pavements and set fires to banks and cash machines.At a late-night press briefing, Senior Supt Ng Lok Chun blamed radical protesters for “hijacking” and disrupting the march and said police had fired teargas because they were surrounded by protesters who were throwing objects at them.There had already been a bleak start to 2020: shortly after revellers counted down to midnight and shouted “Happy new year!”, police in the central district of Mong Kok shot teargas at protesters who set off fireworks and set fire to roadblocks.On Tuesday night police deployed water cannon to disperse protesters while armoured vehicles cleared roadblocks. The crowd had gathered outside a metro station where people were leaving flowers to commemorate protesters rumoured to have died during a clash with police four months ago. The government denies that the deaths occurred.The anti-government movement in Hong Kong, sparked by an extradition bill that would have allowed iniduals to be sent to China for trial, is showing no signs of abating. Protesters say they will not give up unless the government meets their demands, which include universal suffrage and an independent investigation into police brutality.As of last week, 6,494 people had been arrested since the movement started in June, some as young as 12, according to the police.Many in Hong Kong, including pro-democracy supporters, are weary of the frequent violent confrontations in the movement and are seeking new directions in their attempt to press the government into conceding to their demands.Some are urging fellow Hong Kongers on social media to use economic means to put pressure on the government instead, including joining trade unions so that they can launch strikes and other collective actions more effectively.“We want to show our determination to the world that we will not back down on our resistance against an authoritarian regime,” said Mary Chin, a former bank employee in her 40s.The Civil Human Rights Front condemned the police’s abrupt revocation of its permission for the march, which it estimated was attended by a million people.“The government has shown its unwillingness to listen to the voices of the mass and it has infringed on their right to assembly,” it said in a statement. “Hong Kongers shall not back down and peace shall not resume with the ongoing police brutality.”In his new year address, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, acknowledged that “the situation in Hong Kong has been everybody’s concern over the past few months” as he called for “a harmonious and stable environment” for Hong Kong.Sounding relatively conciliatory compared with earlier, more threatening remarks, Xi said in the televised address: “Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability is the wish of Hong Kong compatriots and the expectation for the people of the motherland.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Artificial intelligence programme  detects breast cancer better than experts, study findsChildren excluded from primary school for racism has increased by 40 per cent in 10 yearsCivil servants \u0026#39could be forced to sit exams to prove competence\u0026#39 under sweeping reforms of WhitehallFamilies face month-long wait for bin collections after council workers call in sick after ChristmasDoctor Who: Spyfall, series 12 episode 1 review: no scares here – just a James Bond-style romp with a surprise twist Tributes to \u0026#39beautiful and charismatic\u0026#39 missing man found in bank\u0026#39s wall cavityHeadless torso in Idaho cave identified as Wild West outlaw killed in 1916Man in custody on suspicion of double murder after New Year\u0026#39s Day attackReplica of Tower Bridge in China undergoes £1.5m refit to make it look \u0026#39more Chinese\u0026#39 Libraries will be given more money after years of decline because they are \u0026#39safe places\u0026#39, promises Arts Council chief Israel\u0026#39s prime minister requests immunity to avoid three corruption probes Reintroduction of beavers could protect land against floods and climate changeComment: My 60-something husband is an Airfix-obsessed man child, and there is nothing wrong with thatT.S.

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week.”Neither Mr Ghosn’s lawyer nor a spokesperson for the Tokyo prosecutor’s office had any comment when contacted about his whereabouts.A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment.According to state media, Lebanon\u0027s General Security Directorate intelligence agency said Mr Ghosn entered the country legally and no legal measures would be taken against him.Lebanon does not have an extradition treaty with Japan, according to Japan’s justice ministry, making it unlikely that he could be forced to return to Tokyo to face trial.It was unclear how Mr Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to leave Japan, where his movement and communications had been monitored to prevent him fleeing the country of tampering with evidence. His lawyer in Japanese said he retained possession of all three of Mr Ghosn\u0027s passports.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One unidentified person told the newspaper Mr Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was “tired of being an industrial political hostage”.He is reportedly set to hold a press conference in the coming days.A Nissan source told Reuters: “I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court. It’s outrageous”.Mr Ghosn was arrested on 19 November, 2018, shortly after his private jet landed in Tokyo. He faces four charges – which he denies – including concealing income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East.Nissan sacked him as chairman after internal investigations found misconduct ranging from understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5m (£3.8m) of company funds to an account in which he had an interest.Mr Ghosn has claimed he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of “backstabbing” and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing a closer alliance between the Japanese carmaker and its top shareholder Renault, of which he was also chairman.His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover of the by Renault.The case has brought scrutiny of Japan’s criminal justice system, which allows suspects to be detained for long periods and prohibits defence lawyers from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day.Mr Ghosn was released from prison in March on a $9m (£6.9m) bail, among the highest ever paid in Japan, after the court rejected an appeal by prosecutors to keep him behind bars. He had since been under house arrest.France’s junior economy minister Agnes\u0026nbspPannier-Runacher\u0026nbspsaid she was “very surprised” by news of Mr\u0026nbspGhosn’s\u0026nbsparrival in Lebanon, adding she had heard of it through the media.She told broadcaster\u0026nbspBFM-TV\u0026nbsphe was “not above the laws” but was entitled to consular support from France.Brazilian-born, of Lebanese descent and a French citizen, Mr Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround at the carmaker that won him the nickname “Le Cost Killer”.After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, he used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business superstar status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.In a 2011 nationwide poll about who the Japanese would like to run their country, Mr Ghosn finished seventh – two places ahead of Barack Obama. In another survey, he was named the man Japanese women most wanted to marry.​Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s something that badly needs to be regulated. They’re certainly not exactly about truth in advertising. Even they have said that.

It protects against non-lung forms of TB but is far less effective against TB infections of the lung, which is the major cause of illness and deaths.Researchers from the US\u0026nbspNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Niaid) and University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, have shown changing the dose and route of administration increased the vaccine’s ability to protect\u0026nbsprhesus macaques\u0026nbspfrom infection following exposure to the TB causing bacteria.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in the Loony Dook New Year\u0027s Day dip in the Firth of Forth at South Queensferry, as part of Edinburgh\u0027s Hogmanay celebrationsSurfers at Tynemouth on the north east coastDeer graze in the morning mist as cyclists ride by in Richmond Park, LondonNight sky after the sunset at Whitley Bay in NorthumberlandThe Harlequins players arrive at the stadium prior to the Gallagher Premiership Rugby Big Game 12 match between Harlequins and Leicester Tigers at Twickenahm StadiumGetty Images for HarlequinsA car drives through floodwater near Harbridge, north of Ringwood in Hampshire, after the river Avon burst its banksParticipants in the Old Surrey and West Kent Boxing Day Hunt in Chiddingstone.

The scientists assessed the immune responses after 24 weeks and found intravenous vaccination resulted in the best protection.Six months after vaccination, the researchers exposed the animals to a virulent strain of TB-causing bacteria and tracked the animals for three months.Nine out of 10 animals vaccinated intravenously were highly protected six showed no detectable infection and three had only very low counts of bacteria in lung tissue. All unvaccinated animals and those immunised via the skin or aerosol routes showed signs of significantly greater infection.NHS to slash waiting time targets for cancer diagnosisRevealed: Dozens of hospitals ignoring NHS safety warningsStudy author JoAnne Flynn, professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at the Pittsburgh Centre\u0026nbspfor Vaccine Research, said: “The effects are amazing. When we compared the lungs of animals given the vaccine intravenously versus the standard route, we saw a 100,000-fold reduction in bacterial burden. Nine out of 10 animals showed no inflammation in their lungs.”The researchers cautioned that before the method could be used in humans further research is needed to ensure it is both safe and practical. An intravenous vaccine requires more skill to administer and carries a higher risk of infection.“We’re a long way from realising the translational potential of this work,” Ms Flynn said. “But eventually we do hope to test in humans.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bird, floating on the seawater beneath a cliff, held a stick in its beak.It began to scratch its back with the stick – the puffin, as Ms Fayet watched, was using a tool.Ms Fayet, a puffin expert who studies how the birds migrate and feed, wrote about the crafty bird in her notebook. But she had no photo evidence of this first-of-a-kind sighting. “It was just one observation, and I was busy doing something else,” she said. As unusual as this was, Ms Fayet said, she “kind of forgot about it”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUntil it happened again. In July 2018, Ms Fayet was studying another group of puffins at Grimsey Island in Iceland, about a thousand miles from Wales. She planted camera traps on the island and recorded “loads and loads of puffin behaviour”.Another puffin used a scratching stick. This time, the action unfolded in front of a camera: The bird spots a stick and grasps it with a cartoon-bright beak. The bird makes a burbling sound. It turns, as if to face the lens. And then it scratches its chest feathers with the stick’s pointy end.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Over 400 species discovered this year by Natural History MuseumThe ancient invertabrate worm-like species rhenopyrgus viviani (pictured) is one of over 400 species previously unknown to science that were discovered by experts at the Natural History Museum this year220 Jackdaws can identify \u0027dangerous\u0027 humansJackdaws can identify “dangerous” humans from listening to each other’s warning calls, scientists say. 320 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

In Sesotho, the South African language of the region in which the dinosaur was discovered, its name means a giant thunderclap at dawn1520 Birth of a planet Scientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 1620 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 1720 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 1820 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.1920 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

This was not some nesting behaviour gone awry. Puffins collect soft grass for their nests, then hurry into their burrows with beaks full of bedding. The puffin in Iceland dropped the stick after it finished scratching. Hours later, the camera recorded the stick, still discarded, on the ground.This behaviour “fits all current definitions” of tool use, said University of Oxford zoologist Alex Kacelnik, who has studied toolmaking crows and was not a member of the puffin research team.Outrage over trophy hunts to Iceland to kill puffinsMs Fayet sent the recording to her colleague Dora Biro, an animal behaviour expert at the University of Oxford. The video immediately excited Ms Biro because, as she said, “this was a puffin, this was a seabird – and tool use had never been reported in seabirds before”. Together, with their colleague Erpur Snaer Hansen, the biologists described puffin tools in a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.Studying animal tools can help scientists understand the origins of our own Stone Age, which began when our ancestors picked up rocks around 2.6 million years ago. But tools wielded by beak, paw or snout are rare. Scientists have observed tool use in fewer than 1 per cent of species, which are erratically scattered among animal groups. Chimpanzees and several other primate species use tools. Yet so do sea otters, fish and even some insects, such as ants that sop up honey in spongy matter.Several bird species use tools. Crows in the Pacific, for instance, use hooked twigs to catch grubs. But back-scratching is an unusual form of tool use that the scientists called “body care”. The only other type of body care observed in wild birds, Ms Biro said, is “anting”, in which birds cover their bodies in insects. Bug juices, biologists suspect, can act as chemical defences against bird parasites or fungi.The puffin in Iceland may have been trying to rid itself of ticks. “At the time, when these observations were made, there was also a particularly high parasite load on the birds that year,” Ms Biro said. A scientist who reviewed Ms Biro and Ms Fayet’s paper suggested the stick could have had chemical properties, too. (That’s hard to say the twig was dry, and the scientists don’t know what sort of plant it was.)Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After all, why use a stick when a beak could do? He wondered whether the irritants on the puffins could be “toxic or particularly distasteful” – like a smear of boat fuel, perhaps – “hence the birds may have wanted to avoid beak contact”. In experiments, New Caledonian crows, the grub-fishing species, will use sticks to touch objects the birds perceive as dangerous, such as rubber spiders, he said.Or, maybe, the satisfaction of an itch well-scratched is just one of those things that transcends species.University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailThe perception that the sea crossing is an easier way into the UK has driven up the number of attempts, and led to some migrants making their own efforts to cross the Channel without the assistance of smugglers, said Ms Moreton.“It’s one of the more successful routes across,” she said. “The number of efforts that you have to make to cross are smaller than trying to conceal yourself in a lorry or the back of a vehicle. But it is also much, much more risky.“Until very recently\u0026nbspit’s been the purview of organised crime, these are things that people pay a lot of money to be put onto.“But as it becomes more and more successful it’s more reported in the media, we’re now starting to see people that we think are trying to do this on their own. There’s the gentleman in flippers, two in a kayak, that type of thing.”Border Force boats deployed in the Channel were there primarily to prevent loss of life\u0026nbspand did not necessarily deter would-be migrants, said Ms Moreton.“Once the vessels are in the water, it’s quite common for the migrants on it to threaten their own lives if they’re approached – particularly by a French vessel,” she said. “If they’re approached by a British vessel, they’re quite happy.“Their aim is to get to the UK, and the Border Force vessels aren’t there to deter them from setting sail, they are there to ensure that they reach the other side alive.“There are arguments around that\u0026nbspbut at sea the general rule is that life is paramount.”Ms Moreton said that those arriving by small boat have generally been coached in the stories they should provide to enhance their chances of successfully claiming asylum.But almost half of those intercepted already have asylum claims in other EU countries, which can be traced by fingerprints.While there have been prosecutions for people smuggling in the French courts\u0026nbspthey have not been enough to prevent the trade, she said.The joint action plan agreed with France in January 2019 included more than £6m of British investment in security equipment, CCTV and surveillance on the French coast.The Home Office said an “enhanced action plan” announced in October aimed to make “attempts to cross the Channel in small boats an infrequent phenomenon by spring 2020”.The government department pledged that British and French authorities would increase intelligence-sharing on smuggling gangs, and engage “directly with migrants\u0026nbspto change their behaviour and deter them from making the journey to the UK”.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It took all that time as well as a variety of different investigative techniques – from the latest DNA profiling to more traditional documents – for investigators to find out his identity, and finally inform a surviving relative about what happened.The mystery over the torso began in 1979. A family who were going through Buffalo Cave in the hope of finding arrow heads came across human remains, wrapped in burlap and buried beneath the ground. For a long time after that, nothing new was found.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Photographer Matt Roberts reacts to seeing his sister\u0027s house destroyed by a bushfire in Quaama, New South Wales, AustraliaA man rides a donkey cart against the last setting sun of 2019 in Lahore, PakistanA Skycrane drops water on a bushfire in Bundoora, Melbourne, Australia.

In his televised address, Aoun proposed a government that includes both technocrats and politiciansThen, in 1991, another person going through the same cave system found a mummified hand, and further searches found an arm and two legs that had also been wrapped up and put inside the cave. That was the last that investigators would find in the cave, despite intense efforts from organisations including the FBI.Scientists were able to find some information about the man whose body had been discovered, including the fact that his body could have been there for 10 or more years. Though they could tell the body had been cut apart using tools, there was no way of knowing what had killed him.Researchers then turned to DNA techniques in an attempt to find the identity of the body. Local authorities sought the help of the DNA Doe Project, which seeks to use scientific testing to find the identity of remains so they can be returned to their families.Man executed 13 years ago may be proven innocent by DNAThat turned up much more information about the man, including that his relatives arrived in Utah with\u0026nbspthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. His probably grandfather had four wives, and so the man had a vast number of relatives, researcher\u0026nbspLee Bingham Redgrave told the Associated Press.By searching through a variety of candidates – and discovering a number of strange facts, such as the fact that a grave belonging to\u0026nbspJoseph Henry Loveless didn\u0027t actually include his body – researchers were able to find their candidate. They discovered through archive research that he was accused of killing his second wife, and that though he was sent to prison for the crime he was experienced at breaking out of jail, and did.Investigators think he died soon after breaking out, in 1916. They still don\u0027t know how, or why his body came to be placed in the cave, but hope that keeping the case open could lead to further clues about what happened to him.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan.

He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth.

When he is at home he just loves to snooze on his bed.He is what we call mph couch potatoes. He does have a medical condition where he cannot go in the heat. There is no medical treatment with that and he has a specic cool coat he wears in the summer.Car ridesA good snooze in his bedNeeds:Quiet environment lose to the Dogs TrustA reliable routineA home without children or other dogsTo find out more about Stevie you go here.Stevie is seven years old with little grey hairs sprouting around this snout.Louise says Stevie does get asked about but she believes that because he has been them for so long it raises questions, despite the Dogs Trust being able to successfully re-home nearly  greyhounds in the time hes been in their care.She said: In theory he shouldnt be a dficult dog to re-home but since he has been with us for so long it raises a few suspicions.He would need someone who has had lurcher and greyhounds before because they tend to be loyal as in once they have one they tend to stick to that breed.Stevie loves gnawing on a good bone when it comes to celebrating Christmas and his birthday.However Stevie isnt the Shrewsbury shelters only pooch who has been unlucky in love.A gentle giant named Lilly has been a resident at the Dogs Trust since June .The Rottweiler was dumped at the shelter after the family she came from suffered a breakdown in marriage, leaving her anxious about trusting new people.Louise said Lilly requires a similar home to Stevie but it could take weeks of introductions and further behavioural training before she could be successfully re-homed.She said: You need to spend quite an extensive amount of time with her. She is really worried about new people and once she finds one person then thats it.She needs a strict adult-only home and behaviour training and she is a dog who was initially worried about everything.Lilly also suffers from age-related arthritis and needs help getting into vehicles, but loves going on car rides and can go for group walks with other dogs.She has managed to develop a close bond with one of the volunteers at the Dogs Trust, proving she can learn to trust humans again.Likes:CuddlesWalksCar ridesNeeds: A quiet homeBehavioural trainingMultiple visits to form bonds with potential adoptersToabout Lilly you can go hereLouise added: She is very suspicious and it would require a prolonged introduction.Its hard to say how long it would take but it would take multiple weeks. It is a matter of trying to create this situation for Lilly where she associates new people with positive things.Somewhere down the line the emotional trust left her sometime ago.People are breedist and she is a big, powerful dog and because we say she cant have contact with children and she has specic needs combined that with her breed it would go against her.She isnt some demon dog but we are hopeful weve managed to capture her personality and shes been through a lot in her le.She was the emotional collateral damage in the stress and breakdown that leads to a orce.Louise and the volunteers at the Shrewsbury Dogs Trust have not given up on finding a home for Stevie and Lilly, but they dont recommend adopting a dog for Christmas.She added: We should be able to transfer that relationship that we have established in the centre to a home.We never put down a healthy dog and we have never given up on them.It ties in with the message the dog is for le and not for Christmas and because they are looking for a peculiar environment it makes it tricky and dficult sometimes.Both loving dogs are available for adoption now.If you have what Stevie and Lilly are looking for then contact the Shrewsbury Dogs Trust call   or visit www.dogstrust.org.ukOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But there is still work to do.Top-down control over who gets a chance to be a candidate is demoralising and messy.And they are still outnumbered by Labour’s membership. It’s time to ride the Boris wave and add , new members to the blue ranks.If Labour keep telling themselves Magic Grandad is perfect, and blaming the voters, then this is a chance for the Conservatives to steal a march.WHILE this dwindling decade was stuffed full of exciting political events, it was not a vintage era for decisive majority ­government.There have been thrills — from voters defying Project Fear to free our country from the EU, through to Boris ­Johnson’s crushing victory over Corbynism.And there have been spills — David Cameron’s abrupt exit from power, Theresa May’s loss of her majority, and the hijack of the Labour Party by the far Left. But there have been only a few moments — mere months in the past ten years — of certain, stable, clear government.We have had two hung parliaments, the uncomfortable alliance of the coalition, and a slim Tory majority which was swtly erted by the EU referendum.At Westminster’s worst, a Remainer Commons — helped by a self-indulgent Speaker — trapped a minority Government in office while denying it the power to do anything.It’s all been very entertaining, but entertainment value is not always a sign of great governmentToo often, hung parliaments and paralysed ministers proved unable to make urgent decisions.Important calls were postponed or fudged out of necessity, because the votes to get on with the job were simply not there.Smashing that obstacle to decision-making is one of the many things about the election result to celebrate.Getting Brexit done should only be the start of the changes made by a Government that at last has the chance to be radical and ambitious.Not everybody will be cheering, however. Obviously, the Opposition aren’t happy. And I expect we will soon see some signs of unhappiness from the upper ranks of the civil service, too.Why  First, because theof majority government is a rude intrusion into the lives of civil service chiefs after a decade in which they got used to getting their own way.The absence of clear authority under May, and before that the many tensions and fractures of the coalition years, offered plenty of opportunity for determined mandarins to manage things just as they liked. No longer.Second, because the days in which the civil service was truly neutral, from top to bottom, have sadly ended — and a troubling number of officials seem to feel it is their role to promote a particular view.Brexit has exposed that bias. In the referendum campaign, public bodies which should know better allowed themselves to be used to pump out Remain propaganda, damaging their reputations.The agenda — to try to delay, disrupt and deny Brexit — was obvious. The election result has at last convinced all but the most diehard EU fans that we really are going to leave.But this is not the only issue on which the Government and parts of officialdom disagree.From Michael Gove’s criticism of experts, to Downing Street’s belief that Whitehall is overdue for radical restructuring and reform, there are changes on the way which will disrupt a state of affairs that rather suited a lot of senior people.If the New Year sees whole departments abolished or merged, and a new culture of ministers challenging the sacred cows of Whitehall thinking, then the machine will fight back, hoping to undermine change and keep things the same. There are three ways for ministers and their advisers to defend against that assault.First, steel themselves for a bumpy ride. They’ll be briefed against by past masters of the targeted Whitehall leak who have little to lose. They must not let themselves be knocked off course.Second, they must find allies. For every hidebound part of the civil service, there are others chafing to see things done better. Bring them on board.Third, they should make full use of their power to make public appointments.Labour stuffed the ious quangos and commissions with like-minded people, with similar principles and priorities.Why wouldn’t they  It would be bizarre for a government to appoint its opponents to wield state power against its agenda.And yet that is exactly what the Tories have too often done, apparently through a misguided sense of fair play.It’s time to realise that the other side neverthe favour. Boris and his team know that the election was the start, not the end, of their job.They have to deliver the change that they promised, to fulfil the trust voters put in them. There are battles ahead to make that happen, and wrestling Whitehall will be one of the biggest. Christmas truce will not last long.THE anti-democratic effort to block Brexit cost time, but it also cost money.Fine, ious big businesses might prefer we had voted Remain.But we didn’t.After the referendum, the private sector stood ready to do what it does best: Adapt and get on with le.But what businesses really dislike is not change so much as uncertainty.And Parliament made uncertainty an art form in the past three years.Now that we’ve got a new deal, a new Commons and a new Government, we should see new investment unlocked.Including money and decisions which were shelved during all the political hurly-burly.Let’s get Brexit done, and get Britain booming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sunday Political Editor David Wooding hands out his annual gongs – The Wooders.Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson deluded herself she would be the next PM and toured the land in a coach bearing her giant mugshot on the side.But she didn’t even manage to win her own seat back.At least it cheered up the second most annoying party leader, the SNP’s Nicola Sturgeon, who punched the air in glee at claiming her Scots rival’s scalp.You wait two years for a Labour star to jump ship — then he does it twice in a few weeks.Following his aborted leadership bid, Chuka Umunna launched a new party, Change UK.But he became so fond of change, he did it again and joined the Lib Dems.Now he’s coping with more change after voters booted him out.Expelled left-winger Derek Hatton is readmitted into the Labour Party after a -year wait — only to be kicked out again  hours later.Comeback king Nigel Farage launched the Brexit Party.But within hours, pranksters registered its email address as a porn site.He was swamped with offers from East European women offering a “stress-free” massage.Bet he needed a rub down after his party bombed in the election.John Bercow stood down as Commons Speaker after ten years and was then accused of demanding £million to appear on TV’s I’m A Celebrity.He denied the claims but Brexit-backing MPs would happily have paid Remainer Bercow handsomely to get him out of the Westminster jungle.Naughty-but-nice Trade Secretary Liz Truss attended The Big Sausage event in Norfolk, saying it was, “ticking rather a lot of my boxes”.Asked to try a Gloucester Old Spot banger, she enthused: “That’s one of the best offers I’ve had all year.”It perhaps explains why Liz enjoyed working in a well-hung Parliament so much.Housing minister James Brokenshire showed off his new kitchen which boasts FOUR matching ovens.The revelation must have left the PM wondering where to put his “oven-ready” Brexit deal.It prompted one stunned MP to ask: “Is he running a pizza business on the side ”A miserable year for Jeremy Corbyn as his party and football team tanked.After his election defeat, the Labour leader assured fellow Arsenal fans he wouldn’t be applying for the vacant job of Gunners team boss.Just as well, as he’d probably borrow £billion to buy more left wingers and strikers but remain neutral on whether to play in Europe.Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg was dubbed “insolent” and “insufferable” when he reclined almost horizontally on the Commons’ green benches during a late-night Brexit debate.He refused to budge, amid cries of, “Sit up, man!”But the posh wind-up merchant smiled and nodded when one angry MP sarcastically suggested he should be supplied with a pillow.Spoon-bending psychic Uri Geller vowed to use his “telepathic powers” to stop Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM.After the election, he claimed he influenced Boris Johnson’s landslide victory by giving him a spoon energised with “mind positivity”.Chris “Failing” Grayling quit as Transport Secretary after a string of Brexit planning blunders — including awarding a cross-Channel ferry contract to a firm with no ships.Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson shed st in two years by giving up sugar and taking up exercise.He became so thin that Corbynista “assassins” missed their target in a plot to oust him.Slimline Watson then decided to cast off his ­political baggage and quit as an MP.Shadow Education Secretary Angela ­Rayner has been showered with compliments about her figure after going on a “half-portions” diet.She quipped: “Fat birds don’t win elections.”Neither do slim turkeys when Corbyn is leader.Boris Johnson almost botched his leadership bid after a “screaming row” with his girlfriend over a wine stain on her sofa.Police were called by neighbours who reported “a lot of smashing” from the home he shared with Carrie Symonds.What happened next remains secret.Perhaps it was a ­cover-up — by an upholstery firm.Cops ordered a McDonald’s outlet to stop selling milkshakes during a rally by Nigel Farage in Edinburgh — in case they were used as missiles by customers.The Brexit Party boss completed the visit unscathed, only to be “milkshaked” in Newcastle.Loveable No pup Dilyn outshines ­Cameron, May, Johnson and even Larry the Downing Street cat.The seven-month-old Jack Russell-cross from an animal rescue charity moved in with BoJo’s girlfriend Carrie and always steals the show at official receptions.A real yappy ending.Hapless Karen Bradley admitted she didn’t believe a word she said as Northern Ireland Secretary.She dropped a clanger by saying that killings by the military and police during The Troubles were not crimes — then rowed back, insisting: “I want to be very clear. I do not believe what I said. That is not my view.”Boris Johnson brandished a kipper at his leadership hustings.But his claim that he couldn’t have it delivered by post because of EU rules proved very fishy.Channel  replaced no-shows Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage with melting ice sculptures during a debate on climate change.Viewers probably judged their performance to be less drippy than Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson’s.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked after an inquiry into who leaked details of a National Security Council meeting over plans to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to help build Britain’s G network.Downing Street said the PM had, “lost confidence in his ability to serve”, but he soon ed to Cabinet.All sounds a bit, er, phoney.Boris likened himself to The Incredible Hulk as he vowed to break free from EU shackles.But when he showed schoolkids an image of the superhero during a school visit, a boy pointed at the huge muscles and said: “You’ve got boobies.”She failed to secure a Brexit deal and lost the Tories’ majority.Yet Theresa May soldiered on with everyone against her.When toppled, she didn’t quit Parliament in a huff or carp endlessly from the backbenches but showed more loyalty to her successor than he gave to her.Mrs May could prove to be the finest ex-PM Britain ever had.Remainer lawyer Gina Miller blew thousands trying to stop Brexit — but unwittingly helped deliver it.Her court victory gave Brexit-blocker MPs the right to vote down Theresa May’s “soft” departure deal.But it set off a chain of events that put Bojo in No with a majority big enough to force through a much cleaner Brexit. Thanks, Gina.They spent the past three and a half years plotting to stop Brexit at every turn.But at the General Election, voters sent them a clear message: Leave Parliament.So good riddance to Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, David Gauke, Laura Pidcock, Chuka Umunna, Jo Swinson, Philip Lee, Antoinette Sandbach and Sam Gyimah. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But just before we say goodbye to this year, I’ve been thinking about all the brilliant women who did brave, groundbreaking and seriously inspiring things in .Here, in no particular order, are my pick of those who really stood out — and hopefully will continue to do so for some time to come.It’s been a very mixed year for her. The country has had a tumultuous time, going to the polls and with two Prime Ministers.Her grandsons were apparently feuding and she had to be seen to be laying down the law to Prince Andrew.History may well judge  as her second annus horribilis.Yet somehow, this amazing woman has been the very definition of a dignied, strong and steady leader, offering us the stability and reassurance we as a country so desperately need.Yes, I know women’s football has been going on for years.But  was the year our Lionesses put it firmly on the map.Not only that, they have also inspired a generation of girls to get their boots on and play, knowing they can be just as good as boys on the pitch.So although it’s a shame it’s taken this long, we all owe them a debt of gratitude.I have long admired Emily for asking the hard questions on BBC’s Newsnight.But this year, in the face of the extreme hotting-up of Brexit, culminating in December’s General Election, her coverage has been second to none .Then her grilling of Prince Andrew in November was a masterclass in conducting a good interview — clinical, forensic and meticulous, without a hint of deference.Never shouty or confrontational, she gave Andrew the space to show himself to the public so they could make up their own minds about his culpability in his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.She also somehow managed not to make herself the storyalthough when Prince Andrew described Epstein’s actions as “unbecoming”, she took the chance to look as disgusted as we all feel.“Unbecoming ” she said. “He was a sex offender.”In short, she nailed him.That photo of her wearing the world’s most beautul dress, martini and cigarette in hand at the Emmys after-party, said it all.Earlier in the night she had won three of the four Emmys she was up for — just more in a long line of awards and accolades this year, during which she proved the brilliance of Fleabag was not a one-off.Her sharp, witty and totally original writing on Killing Eve showed she is seriously clever as well as unbelievably glamorous.And her portrayal of women is original, transgressive and totally refreshing.No wonder she was drafted in to give her input and perspective on the next Bond movie.I have a feeling that in  we will realise Phoebe Waller-Bridge is only just getting started.She has had her first baby, conducted her first royal tour and guest edited Vogue. Oh, and she met Beyonce.All in all, not a bad year! She has also managed to consistently put on a brave and happy face while on the receiving end of more criticism than most of us could stand.But it is her le-long passion for and commitment to feminism I admire most.On International Women’s Day, she said: “Men can understand that they can be feminists,” and should feel comfortable about women being by their side, rather than behind them.As we know all too well, not everyone likes a strong woman. But because she is strong, my view is that she will win over her critics in the end.Leave it to the women to organise, unite and provide support to local women in their community and provide support for those affected by the terrible tragedy of the Grenfell fire.Their aim is to provide a networking  and discussion forums for women and arrange positive actions and initiatives that will help the community. But above all, they want to remember — which is why they organise a monthly silent walk in memory of their “lost angels”.My heart breaks for them that they have to do this.But what a brilliant reminder of the power of organisation and women coming together to support each other.Earlier this year, at an equal pay tribunal brought against the BBC by the TV and radio presenter, Samira said she: “Could not understand how pay for me, a woman, could be so much lower than Jeremy Vine, a man, for presenting very similar programmes and doing very similar work . . .“I just ask why the BBC thinks I am worth only a sixth of the value of the work of a man for doing a very similar job.”On behalf of every woman who has felt she should have said something, should have done something, should have spoken out, stood up or walked out when they knew they were being paid less than men in similar roles, but who felt they had no choice but to put up with it, I salute her.I also want to give a mention to the captain of the US women’s soccer team.Yes, she is a great player. But people have lined up to criticise her because she is another strong woman who seems genuinely not to care what people think of her and what she says.They describe her in the US as a “badass” and there is no doubt that she is outspoken on every issue going.But it is her ongoing campaign to normalise gay relationships in sport that really resonates with me.Working in a sport where no male has ever come out as gay while playing in the Premier League, it seems sad — and unacceptable — that people can’t be open about being gay.I think Megan is helping to change that, though.Asked in an interview how it felt to lead the US team, she replied: “Go gays!”She continued: “You can’t win a championship without gays on your team. It’s never been done before. Ever.”Could any collection of amazing women be complete without a mention of the -year-old schoolgirl who has started an international revolution Everything this young woman has done — and she has done more than anyone I can think of to raise awareness about the climate emergency — has been made so much more impressive because of her tenacity in the face of such extreme criticism.Most of the youngster’s critics seem to be men of a certain age who are, I guess, threatened by someone so young and female being so bold, opinionated and unconcerned about what they think.Amazingly, the insults and attacks seem only to have empowered her further and fuelled her determination to make the world listen to what we need to do to try to stop climate change in its tracks.A slip of a girl — and a teen at that — is changing the world.Bravely, and in the face of extreme confrontation at times, she has created a movement where millions around the world follow her and listen to her.She has turned down many accolades because she is not in it for the adulation. She really just wants to make change happen. Truly inspirational.A bit like female Prime Ministers, female newspaper editors are a rarer breed than male ones.Women have such an important role to play in journalism and in fighting for equality.And now, for the first time in  years, there will be a female editor of the Financial Times, which really is groundbreaking, given the paper has been such a bastion of male power for so long.Roula is going to do a magnicent job, not least because she is so focused on increasing newsroom ersity and attracting more female readers, which gives her an obvious spot among my Women of the Year.And a final mention must go to Dr Nyla Raja, purely for personal reasons.She has transformed my skin this year.Everyone needs a great facial and a little help . . . and boy, does she deliver!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

God no. I’m a journalist, down and dirty with the hacks. I’m not interested in being a poacher turned gamekeeper.”Asked about her ‘no-nonsense’ questioning style, she said: “I’ve always been something of a Wigan street-fighter. Always tried to prove myself, always had sharp elbows.“I get paid a good salary to ask the hard questions that people at home would want answered.”AskedPM Boris Johnson was ‘running scared’ of being interviewed by Andrew Neil ahead of the recent election, she said: “Obviously he was, because Andrew Neil is a sensational interviewer.“If I was advising Boris, I’d have said to him: “Do not go in front of Andrew Neil whatever you do.”“But as a journalist, a viewer and a voter, I want to hear what Boris Johnson thinks.

So that is exactly what we are doing.“This government believes in bringing everyone up, not in punishing those who succeed.“Getting Brexit done doesn’t just mean passing legislation, to me it means helping people so that they know the country works for them.”The new minimum pay level keeps the Chancellor on course to meet the pledge he made in October to push it up to £. by , which is two-thirds of median earnings.From my early years in Rochdale and Bristol to my time serving as a cabinet minister, this is my personal mission. Because this government believes in bringing everyone up, not in punishing those who succeed.That means levelling up across regions which have been neglected for too long levelling up our public services by investing in new hospitals, , police and making vocational education a leline of opportunity for young people. And levelling up by helping ordinary working people deal with the cost of living.Lower paid workers are crucial to our economy, whether carers for our elderly and disabled relatives, hospitality staff ensuring we have a great festive season or manufacturers producing world-class goods. Many of them were working over Christmas instead of being sat down and relaxed with loved ones.Because we’ve been responsible in managing the economy, employment is at record high. But this Government is also focused on helping people make their money go further and giving you and your family a better quality of le.In , we introduced the National Living Wage, which gave British workers their biggest pay rise in nearly two decades.I believe the best possible start to  for millions of hard-working people on lower wages is to give them a pay rise. So that is exactly what we are doing, by increasing the National Living Wage by an inflation-busting .% to £. - £ a year extra - for a full-time worker from April. I look back and think what a dference that percentage wage rise would have made for my parents.It’s the largest ever cash increase - proving that hard work does pay under this Government.But I am not stopping there. I confirmed last autumn that we had the ambition to end low pay over the next five years by setting a target for the NLW to reach two-thirds of average earnings in the coming years.And as well as paying more, we want more people to benefit. The NLW currently kicks in on your twenty fth birthday, but we want younger generations too to be able to secure good jobs, save towards a home and achieve their dreams. So while this year minimum wage rates for those workers, including apprentices, will also increase between .% and .%, I have announced plans to ensure that the highest rate is extended to workers aged  and over in , and to those aged  and over within five years.We know these rises must be paid for – so we’re being ambitious but responsible.

This makes them a desirable option for couples who want to legally recognise their relationship but dont have a particular religion.There is also no exchanging of vows, no recognised religious leader carrying out the ceremony and no singing of hymns at a civil partnership.Instead, couples sign the civil partnership document and become known as civil partners - rather than husband and we.Dissolving a civil partnership is similar to marriage but adultery cannot be used as a reason for ending the relationship.Julie and Keith met  years ago while working as journalists but made the decision not to tie the knot because they saw it as traditionally being rooted in patriarchy and religion.She said: We have had a very successful relationship for  years and a bit of paper is not going to make any dference to that whatsoever.While Keith added: As a man, I think it is absolutely crucial that we stand up against this long-standing domination by men over womens rights, and we need to do something about it.I am playing my small part in that.And Ann Chamings and partner John Eccles — together for  years — will tie the knot at Hastings Town Hall today.

Child mortality is at record low levels. Famine virtually went extinct. Malaria, polio and heart disease are declining.Ever since I wrote The Rational Optimist, in , I’ve been faced with, “what about. . . ” questions: What about the great recession, the euro crisis, Syria, Ukraine, Donald Trump  How can I possibly say that things are getting better, given all that The answer is: Because bad things happen while the world still gets better.That is to say, our population and economy would grow, but we would learn how to reduce what we take from the planet. And so it has proved.Scientist Andrew McAfee documented this in his book More From Less, showing how some nations are beginning to use less metal, less water and less land.This does not quite fit with what the Extinction Rebellion lot are telling us.But the next time you hear Sir David Attenborough say: “Anyone who thinks you can have infinite growth on a planet with finite resources is either a madman or an economist,” ask him this: “But whateconomic growth means using less stuff, not more ”For example, a drink can contains  grams of aluminium, much of it recycled. In  it contained  grams.Substituting the former for the latter is a contribution to economic growth, but it reduces the resources consumed per drink.As for Britain, our consumption of “stuff” probably peaked around the turn of the century. The evidence is there.In  Chris Goodall, an investor in electric vehicles, published research showing the UK was now using not just relatively less stuff every year, but absolutely less.Events have since vindicated his thesis. The quantity of all resources consumed per person in Britain fell by a third between  and , from . tonnes to . tonnes.That’s a faster decline than the increase in the number of people, so it means fewer resources consumed overall.Think about your own home. Mobile phones have the computing power of room-sized computers of the s. I use mine instead of a camera, radio, torch, compass, map, calendar, watch, CD player newspaper and a pack of cards.LED light bulbs consume about a quarter as much electricity as incandescent bulbs for the same light. Modern buildings generally contain less steel and more of it is recycled. Offices use much less paper.Even in cases when the use of stuff is not falling, it is rising more slowly than expected.For instance, how much water the world consumed in  was half as much as experts in the s predicted. Inventiveness allowed more efficient irrigation for agriculture, the biggest user of water.Until recently, most economists assumed these improvements were almost always in vain, becauseyou cut the cost of something, people would just use more of it. Make lights less energy hungry and people leave them on for longer.But Andrew McAfee argues that doesn’t hold up. Suppose you switch from incandescent to LED bulbs in your house and save about three-quarters of your electricity bill for lighting. You might leave more lights on for longer, but surely not four times as long.Efficiencies in agriculture mean the world is now approaching “peak farmland”. Despite the growing number of people and their demand for more and better food, the productivity of agriculture is rising so fast that human needs can be supplied by a shrinking amount of land.In , Jesse Ausubel, of The Rockefeller University in New York, and his colleagues argued that thanks to modern technology, we use  per cent less land to produce a given quantity of food compared with  years ago.By  it is estimated that an area the size of India will have been released from the plough and the cow.Perhaps the most surprising statistic is that Britain is using steadily less energy.John Constable, of the Global Warming Policy Forum think tank, points out that although the UK’s economy has almost trebled since , and our population is up by  per cent, energy consumption has fallen by almost ten per cent.This is not necessarily good news, Constable argues. Although the improving energy efficiency of light bulbs, planes and cars is part of the story, it also means we are importing more embedded energy in products, having driven much of our steel, aluminium and chemical industries abroad with some of the world’s highest energy prices.In fact, all this energy-saving might cause problems.Innovation requires experiments . Experiments require energy. So cheap energy is crucial.Thus, energy may be the one resource that a prospering population should be using more of.Since its inception, the environmental movement has been obsessed by finite resources. The two books that kicked off the green industry in the early s, The Limits To Growth, in America, and BlueprintFor Survival, in Britain, both lamented the imminent exhaustion of metals, minerals and fuels.The Limits To Growth predicted thatgrowth continued, the world would run out of gold, mercury, silver, tin, zinc, copper and lead well before . School textbooks soon echoed these claims.This caused the economist Julian Simon to challenge the ecologist Paul Ehrlich to a bet that five metalswould cost less in  than in .The Stone Age did not end for lack of stone, Simon said, arguing that we would find substitutesmetals grew scarce.Simon won the bet easily, and Ehrlich sniped that: “The one thing we’ll never run out of is imbeciles.”To this day, none of those metals has signicantly risen in price nor run out. A modern irony is that many green policies advocated now would actually reverse the trend towards using less stuff.A wind farm requires far more concrete and steel than a system based on gas. Environmental opposition to nuclear power has hindered the generating system that needs the least land, least fuel and least steel or concrete per megawatt.Burning wood instead of coal in power stations means the exploitation of more land — and even higher emissions. Organic farming uses more land than conventional methods.Technology has put us on a path to a cleaner, greener planet. We don’t need to veer in a new direction. To do so risks retarding progress.As we enter the third decade of this century, I’ll make a prediction.By the end of it we will see less poverty, less child mortality, less land devoted to agriculture.There will be more tigers, whales, forests and nature reserves. Britons will be richer and each of us will use fewer resources.The global political future may be uncertain, but the environmental and technological trends are pretty clear — and pointing in the right direction. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And London Mayor Sadiq Khan has been accused of planting political messages in the display in previous years. Last year the display appeared to have an anti-Brexit tint to it - We Are Your Friends, Stay and Donapost Leave Me Alone were among songs chosen for the -minute soundtrack, which featured artists from Ireland, France, Sweden and where. And the London Eye was lit up to resemble a giant EU flag. But this yearaposs alleged message was a bit more ambiguous. During the display, the White Stripesapos Seven Nation Army was played.

But it’s not all doom and gloom. Despite an onslaught of online competition, some high streets are thriving. As we enter the New Year, the Mirror – which is championing town centres with our High Street Fightback campaign – highlights three of the many inspirational places that are standard-bearers for how it can be done. Buzzing as we have the best community spirit It’s am on a Friday and Belper’s main street is bustling. The town lies at the heart of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site. Industrial pioneer Jedediah Strutt built one of the world’s first water powered cotton spinning mills here in . But, like many towns, it has had its fair share of challenges in recent years. Chocolate maker Thorntons and a clothes company closed their factories in the early s, and textile maker Courtaulds shut its plant in , with hundreds of job losses. But you couldn’t tell the impactyou took a walk round the Derbyshire town’s centre now.  There is hardly an empty shop, and along with a few chain stores – including Boots, Wilko, Card Factory and Hays Travel – there are an array of independents. They include two butchers and a greengrocer, gt shops, plus the wonderful looking Ritz Cinema. But above all, there is a genuine buzz about the place. Chris Gregory, co-owner of the fantastic Beaurepaire Patisserie cafe, echoes many the Mirror spoke to about why the high street is doing well. He said: “It’s got the best community spirit. Whenever an event is put on it’s really well attended.” Chris, , who is born and bred in the town, and his partner have another shop in Belper and added his sister plans to open an interiors store here. He said: “The shops don’t become available that often and go really quickly.” Julia Greening has had her furniture and interiors shop, Sundial, for  years. She appealed for people not to take local shops for granted, saying: “If you let shops go, they are lost for ever.” One reason for Belper’s success is a band of business owners who have worked tirelessly to promote the place. They include Laura Armstrong, who runs menswear shop Strut, and chairs the Love Belper committee. The Love Belper website has been a big hit, while its use of social media has drawn visitors in from further afield. Laura, , said: “We have people coming from Derby because they say it’s dying on its feet.” Laura, who praised Belper town council for its support, said trading for her is hard, despite all the efforts. It proves how even high streets that are pulling out all the stops still need people’s backing to flourish. Transformed after tough times  Five years ago Treorchy was just another part of the Valleys struggling to come to terms with the collapse of big industry. But take the time to stroll down the high street now and you realise an inspiring transformation has slowly taken place. Treorchy has nearly  shops. Whereas a decade ago many were struggling or empty, the town now boasts an occupancy rate of %. The vast majority of these businesses are independent and most are run by women, giving the high street a refreshingly cosy vibe. This transformation has been the result of a lot of hard work by business leaders here who realised action had to be taken. They came together under the stewardship of Treorchy Chamber of Trade chairman Adrian Emmett, who has watched the membership soar from  to . The traders have launched a series of initiatives, such as the Visit Treorchy website, to attract people to invest. Adrian explained that, underpinning it all, is a “circular market” in which each business prioritises buying from each other. He said: “Towns like this did not have the confidence. They needed to believe in themselves and we needed to change the mindset. I like to think we’re doing that and the confidence is back.  “I am so proud of how much we have achieved.” Holly Thomas, , who is the very proud owner of the Number  gt shop, said: “I think the reason it has worked is because we have all come together.” Zoe Davies, , who has run the Fusion beauty parlour for  years, is delighted by the way Treorchy’s high street has been transformed. She said: “It was worrying at one point when you saw all the empty shops but now it is thriving and it is nice to be part of it.” Plenty to smile about in the friendliest port  The number of people visiting the award-winning shops here has rocketed. Civic chiefs from across the country go to Amble, Northumberland, to learn the secrets of its success. It was shortlisted in  for the Great British High Street champion award after winning the coastal community category three years ago.  Traders in what is known as “the friendliest port” are seeing the benefits of the “Harbour Village”, part of a £.million Government investment. A £, national bird sculpture trail is to come. The town square’s beautul war memorial is a reminder of Amble’s proud history the Cock  Bull micro pub shows it is moving with the times. That is where the cock and bull ends there is real success here. Queen Street is at the heart of it.

Heaposs also the first born of superstar royal couple, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who clearly dote on him, so itaposs perhaps not surprising that a report of their first Christmas together claims he was showered with gts.As the Mirror has reported , the new family spent Christmas at a luxurious £million waterside estate and mansion in Canada, understood to belong to a Russian oligarch. And itaposs there, according to a source who spoke to US , that the new parents bought Archie books, building blocks, a baby ball pit, the source said.They added that itaposs not all about extravagant gts for them. This would chime with a description of the royal couple by American comic and chat-show host, Ellen Degeneres, who said they were the most down-to-earth, compassionate people. Indeed, Harry and Meghan were so keen to give their son a normal le, they chose at birth to not give him the courtesy title Earl Dumbarton or style him Lord Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, instead taking it upon themselves to decide he should just be a plain aposMasterapos. Building blocks are a classic present for newborns as they learn to navigate the physical world and develop their coordination skills.With books, parents Harry and Meghan will be able to read to their son and start him on the road to developing language skills - something which is likely to be important as he surely grows up into a sought-after public figure. And a ball pit is perfect for when he just wants to thrash around and be boisterous, like many other infant boys his age. It was also reported that Archie - like his cousin and future king, Prince George - is already showing his confident, outgoing side. As a baby, at his first aposmeet and greetapos, in  Prince George seemed bold and confident, going straight for the biggest toy in the room.  And it would seem Archie is no dferent. The source told Us: “You can tell Archie’s going to be a confident social butterfly. “He loves being entertained and interacting with people. Some children get shy or nervous around new people, but not Archie. He’ll go to anyone without kicking up a fuss!” The Duke and Duchess chose to spend the festive period on Vancouver Island as opposed to staying with the rest of the Royal Family at Sandringham. Meghan, , and Harry, , were also joined by the Duchessaposs mum Doria Ragland - who briefly lived with the couple when they first brought Archie, now seven months old, home to Frogmore Cottage .Locals reported they had seen Harry and Meghan out jogging in the Canadian town of North Saanich and others had spotted them hiking in Horth Hill Regional Park on Vancouver Island. Harry and Meghan also shared a photo of their Christmas card in the run-up to December .The adorable photo shows the Duke and Duchess of Sussex laughing in the background with Archieaposs cute little face in the foreground. The family is sat comfortably on the floor in front of a Christmas tree, complete with flashing lights and baubles. Meghan and Harry have been criticised for deciding to spend Christmas away from Prince Philip and the Queen on what could be their last Christmas.

Tipping the scales at st lb, Julie ­struggled to do any basic activity. She got breathless walking around the house and found it hard to keep up with her three ­children, Dillon, , Keigan, , and Lois, nine. “My size made me miserable and I always felt like I was on the sidelines of le,” she says. “I wasn’t really getting as involved as I should because my size was holding me back.” Unbeknown to Julie, her mother’s biggest hope before her death at just , was for Julie to lose weight. But for a year, the opposite happened as she ate through her grief. Julie finally decided to join her local Slimming World group with her two sisters, Lindsey, , and Katie, . And, in  months, she had lost an ­incredible eight stone and was down to a size . After hitting her target weight on Christmas Eve  – st lb – she got a touching message from her mother’s friend, Helen, to tell her how proud she was – and how worried her mother had been. Julie, an early years’ practitioner from Oldmeldrum, Aberdeenshire, said: “It was awful to hear that Mum had been so worried about me – especially in those last few months – but I know how proud she would be to see how well I’ve done. “It really has changed my le. Instead of just surviving, I’m finally living!” The mum of three admits she had always struggled with her weight and, as a teenager, was two dress sizes bigger than her friends and a size . But it wasn’t until she met her husband John, now , in April , that she really began to pile on the pounds.  She says: “We’d have nights in with ­takeaways, go out for meals or have friends over and snack on crisps and wine.” The couple married in June . However, in the three years they had been together, Julie, who is ft in, had gone from a size  to a size . And the problem only got worse, in , when Vera was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Julie moved into her home to care for her. She says: “When Mum moved into a hospice in August , I’d grab breakfast on the run so I could be with her, then we’d have tea and cake in the day. It became easier to grab a McDonald’s when I headed home. And rather than eating a balanced diet, I just ate rubbish.” Vera passed away in November , but Julie’s weight continued to spiral, and she was soon a size . “I could barely walk up the stairs without getting out of breath and did absolutely no exercise,” she explains. “So, when my sisters joined Slimming World in January , I went too because I didn’t want to miss out!” And soon she saw a huge dference. “I started to think more about what I was putting in my body” Julie says. “Instead of grabbing the easiest thing, like a jar of sauce to chuck on some spaghetti, I’d make it and know what ingredients I was putting in. I naturally found myself eating more fruit and veg and the weight was just falling off – it was so easy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rail fares rose twice fast","story":"NewsRail fares rose twice as fast as wages over past  years as prices go up againIn the decade since , fares for commuters have risen by % but the average weekly wage has only risen %.

In the decade since , fares for commuters have risen by %. But the average weekly wage has only risen %, according to a TUC analysis of official figures. The shocking revelation by the TUC comes as commuters ing to work today have been hit with a .% rail fares rise. And the trade union body says the increase cannot be justied when the private rail companies have paid out more than £.billion in idends to shareholders in the past five years. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “Working people have had enough of over-crowded and unreliable services. “The number one priority should be running a world-class railway service, not subsidising shareholders.  “No more excuses - the government must end the failed privatisation and put trains back in public ownership. This would free up money for much-needed upgrades and lower ticket prices for working people.” Some British commuters are spending seven times as much on train season tickets as counterparts in Europe. TUC research also shows someone on an average salary travelling from Chelmsford in Essex to London will have to fork out % of their pay for season tickets . But comparable commutes would cost a mere % of the average salary in France, and % in Germany and Belgium. Pressure group the Campaign for Better Transport is pressing for a full reform of the rail fares system. Darren Shirley, CBT chief executive, said: “Rail passengers are tired of rising fares and broken promises. “Only total reform will start to restore passengers’ faith in the rail network, and ensure the railways are more affordable and better value for passengers.” The Government sets the January fare increase using July’s Retail Price Indexlevel - which critics say is a discredited and out-dated statistic. If the more appropriate Consumer Price Indexhad been used to set fare increases, regulated fares - including season tickets and standard s - would have risen by .% today, according to the CBT. Robert Nisbet, director of nations and regions for industry body the Rail Delivery Group, said: “We know that no-one wants to pay more to travel, and rail companies have, for the third year in a row, held average fare increases below inflation while continuing to deliver investment in new trains and extra services that will improve journeys for customers.  “In , we will work together to run , extra services a week and roll out , more train carriages as we replace half the country’s train carriages. “We will also continue to push for changes to regulations that would make rail fares match how people work today and tackle crowding on the busiest long-distance routes.” The Department for Transportis expected to publish a white paper based on the findings of the Rail Review in the coming weeks. Shadow Transport Secretary Andy Mcdonald said: “Today’s average fare increase of .% means ticket prices have risen by % since .

But itaposs more likely the festive season makes you extra-vigilant. Keeping an eye on how much they drink. Worrying what your loved ones will notice. Hiding the cost of things. Terried that now thereaposs witnesses.  Victims of domestic abuse are usually the last ones to realise it. You will probably tell people,it comes up, that someone who stays with their abuser is an idiot. You genuinely believe this, because you do not know much about it. Whether you are having your money taken, your liberty restricted, or your peace of mind destroyed, you are far too close to see it properly. You canapost get perspectiveyouaposre not at peace. Calls to police about domestic incidents spike at Christmas. The combination of alcohol, financial and family pressure, and being in close quarters adds to the pressure which you have got used to dealing with - like a temperamental, dysal cooker that will burn the roast,you donapost know the trick of how to close the door just so. You might think that knowing such tricks, spotting the problems early and moving quickly to deflect them, makes you a great chef. Actually what it means is youaposve got a knackered cooker.  A victim calls the police every  seconds for help. According to the Office of National Statistics, last year there were .m domestic abuse incidents and crimes recorded by police. Only  in every  such reports ever leads to an arrest. And the first time somebody asks for help is, on average, the th time something that is not normal has happened to them.They will not get effective help until it has happened  times.On average, victims live with their abuser for  or  years before they leave. Some for decades. Two thirds of them will try to leave  or  times in the year before they finally manage it. But not you. Because youaposve got this.  You are strong. You know how to fix it, and what sets it off. You know not to wear those clothes, not to talk about those things, not to ask that question. You know when to send the kids to your mumaposs, when to say sorry, when to go limp because thataposs the quickest way to make it end.You know itaposs normal to argue. You know itaposs normal for things to get a bit out of hand. Itaposs normal that someone with problems - perhaps drugs, or booze, issues at work or in their past - needs you to understand them better. They need YOUR help.Maybe the first time you said sorry it felt wrong, but it was the only way to make things calm again. Maybe you now think that youaposre always the one to blame. But you are strong, so you stay. Even though it is not normal to have to convince yourself to do that. It is not normal for blood to be spilled on bedsheets. Itaposs not normal for the neighbours to be so alarmed they call the police. Itaposs not a normal argument,you are down by one bedside lamp at the end of it and someoneaposs had to go to AE to get patched up. It IS entirely normal for the person responsible to tell you that itaposs fine, that you made them do it, thatonly you donapost do that again they wonapost get so angry, that you need to apologise to them and thataposs the only way to make up. It is normal for them to want, and expect, and need all the sympathy thataposs going.And itaposs entirely normal that you believe them. They use the same words and phrases our parents use, likeyou do that again... They play on the fact you love them. They tell you they love you, or perhaps theyaposve stopped telling you that, because it makes you work harder to hear it. It is normal that you bend. It is not normal that you break your spine doing it.  When was the last time you did not worry about what would happen at Christmas  When was the last time you worked, went out, had fun, flirted, relaxed, or laughed like you used to  When was the last time you talked about your relationship to someone , and didnapost lie about it  It is not normal to worry what the person who is supposed to love you will do next. It is not normal to hide the truth, wear clothes that cover it up, or pray the family donapost notice how afraid you are. You are right. Someone who can put up with all of this is very strong, and capable of deep and abiding love. It is the person doing it to you who is weak.  They are the one who feels something in their le is out of control - anything, from their age to their job to an addiction. Perhaps thereaposs an unexpected pregnancy, or a bereavement. But one way or another, they havenapost quite got a grip on things. So they hold on to you a bit tighter. At the start itaposs just a hug. But over time, you find it harder to breathe, to be you. You change, bend, accommodate, compromise, and every time you do they ask for more. Itaposs never enough. Something will always make them cross again, and you have to bend further. If youaposre lucky it will stop all by itself. Butitaposs not fixed itaposll come back. Do you really want to spend the next  years - hell,  minutes - waiting to seeit will happen again  Last year the police recorded  domestic homicides. Thataposs more than one person, every day, killed by someone they live with. One fth of people aged  to  have personal experience of domestic abuse. Itaposs horribly normal, what youaposre going through. But you are going through it. And itaposs possible to get out.

TV news presenters Hannah and Lewis Vaughan Jones spent years battling with infertility. But just before Christmas the pair announced the arrival of Matheson Calon Tallett Vaughan Jones - or Sonny for short - who they described as perfect in every way.Weaposve been through many years of heartache, but weaposve got the best Christmas present at the end of it all, said CNN news anchor Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny on December , Wales Online reports.We have been very public about it for the past three years or so, but in the years before that it was very private and painful - and there was a lot of shame involved which anyone going through infertility will be familiar with. But we have been lucky. We are the very, very lucky ones. Lewis, originally from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was harrowing watching his we going through round after round of IVF which involved frequent injections and hormone treatment. We wanted a family, but frankly we didnapost think it was going to happen for us, said Lewis, a freelance news presenter for BBC News and ITV News. In fact, I think weaposd already emotionally moved on. We said to each other that this was going to be our last round [of IVF]. And it was the last little embryo that we had left. Weaposd sent it off for testing and the results came back inconclusive, so we didnapost think it was going to work at all.  But weaposd come this far, so we made the decision to put the embryo back in and, unbelievably, it grew to become Sonny. The couple, who live in Twickenham, said they spent around £, on private IVF treatment after being given one round for free with the NHS. They said the odds of having a baby were severely stacked against them. Weaposd been through so much disappointment and we were emotionally ready to move forward with our lives, said Hannah, . But when the pregnancy test came up as positive I really couldnapost believe it. We didnapost allow ourselves to get too excited in the first  weeks or so until weaposd had the viability scans.  There was huge, huge relief when they said the growth and development was fine. Hannah, who gave birth to Sonny via c-section weighing exactly lb, said there were a few dficult moments during his first few days of le. He lost a lot of weight in the first week which we panicked about. We already thought we were terrible parents and didnapost know how to keep this little human being alive. But heaposs now finally caught up to his birth weight.

Last December Becky Dell was inspired by the David Attenborough show Blue Planet to do her bit to help the environment. The Londoner decided to only buy food, drink and basic toiletries in . Writing on Twitter Becky said she watched, with shame plastic floating in the oceans and wondered how much was hers. So, aside from mascara and moisturiser, Becky did not buy anything she didnapost need. That meant no clothes, shoes, presents, other makeup, hair products, jewellery, bags, decorations, anything disposable, plants, flowers, house items etc. And the money that she saved from not splashing out would be given to a selection of charities and grassroots organisations. Becky says she ended up saving and donating £,.. But there were times when emergencies meant she had to buy something. On Twitter she said: I bought  things during the year, for example, a new jacket when my zip broke at - up a mountain, brr, a couple of essential things for my very elderly cats and a couple of essential house items. Each one made me really annoyed! And friends and family understood her challenge and supported Beckyaposs decision, with the thrty musical director making presents herself instead. And there were some things she really missed. Becky wrote: The thing I missed the most was buying plants and flowers, I love nature and found that hard. Solutions were growing flowers from seedand getting cuttings from friends . I now have rhubarb growing!!  At first, she said, it was quite easy: January to August was surprisingly easybut it got WAY hard from August, as clothes started running out and however much I darned my socks they just stayed holey. It got easier in December as I could start counting down. After  months of austere living the first thing Becky plans on splashing out on is socks, plants, some nice tea towels and a tea strainer.

Bulgarian born Baba Vanga has been dubbed the aposNostradamus of the Balkansapos for her predictions. Despite dying  years ago, those with a keen interest in mysticism continue to revere Babaaposs work, which some claim looks forward to  - the year she believed the universe will end. Right before her death at the age of  she made a series of predictions for the year . The most startling revelation is that Vladamir Putin and Donald Trumpaposs lives are in danger. The Russian president could reach the end of his mortal coil thanks to an assassination attempt made from within the Kremlin. Almost as dramatically, the US president will fall ill with a mysterious illness which will leave him deaf and with a brain tumour. Those with long memories may remember Baba foretold that Putin and Trumpaposs lives would be in danger last year, suggesting some kind of cosmic rollover.  Another recurrent theme in her predictions has been the destruction of Asia. Baba foresaw that “a big wave will cover the shore and people will disappear underwater” in what some interpreted as the destruction of Thailand by a huge tsunami in . The outlook in  is equally as bleak, with more tsunamis and earthquakes scheduled to hit the continent. A meteorite is also predicted to fall on Russia.  Perhaps the most ominous prediction of the clairvoyant was that the European continent could reach the end of its existence at the hands of Muslim extremists The Bulgarian suggested that extremists would use an arsenal of chemical weapons against Europeans”. Supporters of Baba are keen to emphasise how spot on she has been, with % accurate a phrase that regularly crops up in fan forums. According to baba-vanga, the figure is drawn from research conducted by Professor Georgi Lozanov - a former director of the Bulgarian Institute of Suggestology. Others point to her past successes as proof that she had foresight beyond that of a typical human.  In  she guessed that America would be hit by two apossteel birdsapos in a terror attack, in what was later interpreted as a reference to  . She said: Horror, horror! The American brothers will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing. Babaaposs big breakthrough had come a year earlier however, when she accurately predicted the sinking of Russian submarine the Kursk. Before cancelling Christmas and ordering a nuclear bunker however, readers should know that some questions remain around Baba and her predictions - some of which have been proved to be way off the mark.  Her prophecy that Europe would cease to exist by  was clearly wrong, unless seen through an incredibly generous Brexiteer lense. Babaaposs suggestion that the  FIFA World Cup final would be played between two teams beginning with the letter aposbapos was equally wrong. The nuclear war pencilled in for the years  to  also failed to materialise. Perhaps more damning is the seemingly non-existent nature of her prophecies. While Baba may have spoken or written down her predictions in Bulgarian, no credible version is available to view. According to a  Washington Post investigation, the few prophecies that can be traced back to their origins appear to come from Russian social media. When Bulgarian newspaper  Chasa interviewed Babaaposs neighbours, they said she had never predicted  , the sinking of the Kursk or the big war.

Learning a new skill, getting organised or making more effort with loved ones are popular New Yearaposs Resolutions - but vows to eat better and hit the gym are always the loudest, especially after all that Christmas boozing. However despite all that January  determination, most of us have swapped the lentils for pasta and put our gym kit back in the wardrobe before we even get to Valentineaposs Day. But this year, personal trainer Steve Ahern, from Nottingham, is on hand with some top tips on how to actually stick to your resolutions in . He believes there are several core mistakes that people make when it comes to getting into shape in the new year, which really hold them back in terms of reaching their goals. Start slow and be patientWe donapost have the patience and thataposs why people stop so quickly. We want it now. You need to start slow and be patient. Rome wasnapost built in a day. I know itaposs corny, but itaposs true. Itaposs great that youaposre doing something butyouaposre not building the base itaposs very hard for it to last. People end up going to the gym five or six times a week, theyaposre not letting their body rest and recover. Then they donapost see any changes so they move onto something . Be consistent. If youaposre just doing a day here and there youaposre never going to see results. Do something you love Not many of us can honestly say we would rather go out for a run than sitting in the pub or chilling out on the sofa with a brew. But spending time finding something you actually like doing can make all the dference when it comes to sticking to your fitness plan.  Steve said: If you hate going to the gym, donapost go to the gym. If you hate running, donapost go running. Find something you like doing. Le is far too short to do something that you hate. Donapost worry about other people Another of the big problems is comparing yourself to others, especially when it comes to seeing results. Steve also says that social media can have an extremely negative impact on peopleaposs fitness dreams as they are constantly looking at filtered and edited photos of people working out. Weaposre all dferent. We all get dferent results at dferent times. Weaposre constantly scrolling on Instagram looking at all these people and asking why we donapost look like that. People donapost look like that  .

Kim also said there were no grounds for North Korea to be bound any longer by a self-declared moratorium on testing nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles . The moratorium was imposed following talks between Kim and Trump, but Pyongyang has since test-fired a number of short-range missiles into the sea and satellite images have suggested it has continued work on its nuclear programmes. The comments from North Koreaaposs leader were released by state media after he presided over a four-day meeting of top Workersapos Party officials amid rising tensions with the United States. Washington has not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations. It has instead has dismissed the deadline as articial. At times smiling or striking the podium with his hand as he made remarks during the meeting, Kim accused the United States of gangster-like demands and maintaining a hostile policy, such as by holding continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions.  He pledged to continue bolstering his countryaposs nuclear deterrent but said the scope and depth of that deterrent will be properly co-ordinated depending on the attitude of the US. He signalled there was still room for dialogue with the United States. The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future, Kim said, using the initials for North Koreaaposs official name - the Democratic Peopleaposs Republic of Korea. He added: We will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the US and guaranteeing our long-term security.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be deeply disappointingKim reneges on denuclearisation commitments and Kim would hopefully choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war. In his latest comments on Tuesday in the United States, Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word. The US president said: He likes me, I like him. We get along. Heaposs representing his country, Iaposm representing my country. We have to do what we have to do. But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearisation.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users

south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow

There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.The Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias ndash many backed by Iran ndash called on their supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying ldquoyour message has been received.By late afternoon, the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. --vw,vw,px, px\"A man waves the Iraqi flag while Iraqi army soldiers are deployed in front of the embassy --US Apache helicopters circled overhead.ldquoAfter achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly, said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. ldquoWe rubbed Americarsquos nose in the dirt.Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the US air strikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"talented-ross-high-school-pupil-reaches-futurechef-finals","story":"Bartek Kocot, an S pupil at the school, cooked up a winning meal for judges and will now represent East Lothian at the regional level of the competition, organised by Springboard FutureChef to inspire young people to cook.Bartek was chosen to represent Ross High at the heat because of the standard of his cooking in class and his efforts to practise dishes outside of school hours.He competed against four other pupils at the school in their own heat, then in round two competed at an event at Edinburgh College, Granton Campus last Thursday against pupils from secondary schools in Edinburgh and the Lothians.The dishes were judged by professional chefs Glyn Stevens, Stephen Frost and David Bell.Due to his success, he will now compete in the penultimate round of the competition ndash the regional finals, which will take place in Glasgow on February  ndash ahead of the national finals, which are held in London later next year.His dishes were: herb and panko crusted cod with mashed potato, sweet potato with a parmesan crisp and berry poached pear with cookie snap biscuit and cream cheese.Jenner Hart, home economics teacher at the school, said: ldquoWe are all so proud of Bartek, especially as he designed the dessert himself.ldquoThe judges normally only choose one pupil out of Edinburgh and the Lothians however, they said that the standard of dishes was so high that they decided to choose Bartek from East Lothian and Katie from Castlebrae Community High to represent Edinburgh City.ldquoThey said they were very impressed and that they have never seen such a high standard of dishes at the local final.ldquoWe were lucky enough to have executive training chef from the Apex Hotel John Newton as Bartekrsquos mentor so thank you to him for all his expertise and support.Ross High headteacher Paul Reynolds said: ldquoI am thrilled for Bartek.

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the

atmosphere.While Skyrora insisted that the engine tests would be a ldquoclean burn producing mainly water, resident and biochemist Dr Brian Hall told the committee that he estimated about , litres of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide could be released during each -second test.Calum Miller, on behalf of Prestonpans Community Council, urged councillors to approve the plans, pointing out that the power station site had lain empty now for six years.He told them: ldquoThe council has the opportunity with this Skyrora application to dispel the myth that we are too remote from Edinburgh to attract business.Ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell, Lachlan Bruce and Neil Gilbert did not support the application.Ms OrsquoDonnell said that the impact on local amenity would be unacceptable and spoke of the ldquohigh level of public concern from constituents about the proximity of the test site to housing ndash the nearest of which was estimated at  metres away.Councillors rejected the planning application by six votes to two.The decision was welcomed by Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council chairman Mr Hickman, who said: ldquoThe community is very pleased about the decision as expressed on social media and meeting residents as I go about.ldquoI felt that we presented a strong case against the application.ldquoThe councillors present gave a fair and balanced summary before coming to their decision. The community thanks the ward councillors who called in the application.ldquoIf this did not go before the committee, it would have been approved by East Lothian Council planning department.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said that he hoped the council would now turn attention to calls for a cruise port at the former power station site, which has been supported by his members. He said: ldquoI am disappointed that local ward councillors went against the advice of their council officers on this planning application.ldquoHopefully this will focus East Lothian Council councillors and officials on pushing forward the cruise port initiative to secure much-needed jobs in East Lothian.And his community council colleague Mr Miller criticised councillors for failing to listen to their officials.He said: ldquoIt was patently obvious that councillors on the planning committee couldnrsquot get their heads around the nuances of decibels and emissions.ldquoThey should have fallen back on advice from their own experienced officials. Instead, they repeated the junk science coming from cranks in Cockenzie.ldquoEach test would have generated the same emissions as a family car running for a year. The councillors who referenced a climate emergency in defence of their decision were only too happy to drive home from Haddington.ldquoAn ecosystem of space technology companies could have emerged in East Lothian based around the testbed.ldquoThe wilful ignorance of a few has pulled opportunity for the hands of young people in East Lothian.Derek Harris, from Skyrora, said he was disappointed by the decision of the planning committee.It is understood the company will take time to consider whether to appeal the decision.Mr Harris said: ldquoI would like to thank all the staff at East Lothian Council who helped with our application.

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

C Duncan - Talk Talk TalkThe sublime opening track from the third album from the Glasgow musician and the first away from his bedroom studio, also moved him away from his introspective art pop on this, into synth pop gem territory. But typical of the Scot who received a Mercury Prize nomination for his debut album Architect, it remains sounding like nothing  around, with signature layered harmonies and a gorgeous hooksome middle eight.ldquoTalk Talk Talk is about miscommunication. Itrsquos about not realising that yoursquore actually on the same page as someone and how a misperception can drive you apart. However, itrsquos also about realising this and rebuilding bridges,\" Duncan says. Wuh Oh - Pretty Boy Glasgow-producer Wuh Oh, aka Peter Ferguson teams up with Hudson Mohawke for a mindblowingly original classical meets post-electro music with cellos and xylophones thrown in for good measure.\"One day something in my brain exploded and it was asI could suddenly see what made the chord progressions and melodies work. I got mega obsessed with harmony and since then Irsquove never stopped searching for magic note combinations I donrsquot understand yet: those greeny-purple chords,\" Ferguson says. Goodnight Louisa - Hollow GodldquoBettys got her head in the oven again.\" So starts this spinetingling, highly charged, emotionally dark but hopeful cinematic-pop debut single from Louise McCraw who fronted the underrated Edinburgh band Skjoslashr.It is dedicated to a little boy in the accompanying video, her uncle, Michael. He died ten years after the footage was shot as the result of a tragic car accident. \"I drew a lot of inspiration from Michael to write this song, that no matter when we think weve lost someone, they still live within us, in the curve of an eye, through theof a nose, through our mannerisms, we will carry them forever,\" she says.Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  Top  Tunes from Scotland in  Part  This is the Spoty playlist.This is the YouTube playlist."},{"url":null,"title":"people-decade-20-movers-shakers-history-makers","story":"In , Time Magazine named its person of the year as \"the silence breakers\". McGowan was just one of those many women who stepped forward to make accusations about Harvey Weinstein that year. She was there at the beginning of a series or revelations about the producer which would snowball into a global sharing of stories of womens experience of sexual assault and harassment that would be called #MeToo.If anyone became a figurehead, it was McGowan. She may not have come up with the term Me Too ndash that was Tarana Burke back in . Nor was she the person to put the hashtag out into the ocean of social media ndash that was Alyssa Milano, her co-star from Charmed. But she made her mark as someone who would not be silenced. She has also claimed that she was the first person to out Weinstein.#MeToo was a cultural revolution and catharsis. Back in , when it broke, it felt asHollywood and the many fields where men were protected by their power and influence would never be the same again. In this revolution around what women should tolerate, who would be listened to, and what should be shamed, McGowan stood out. She wrote a memoir, Brave. She used her anger as a weapon. In an interview with the Times, she asked, \"Who has been more effective  hellip Playing nice for women hasnt got us very far.\"Weinstein recently complained that he was \"a forgotten man\". With his trial coming up next month ndash five charges, including two counts of rape ndash he might wish he were more forgotten than he is. #MeToo might have experienced backlash and criticism. But out of it did come much that was positive and inspirational, particularly the courage of the women who came forward. McGowan embodies that. Her voice carried the message that the time when abusers could expect silence was over.VICKY ALLANPHOEBE WALLER-BRIDGE, ACTOR, WRITER AND PRODUCERSpeaking to The Herald recently, Scottish actress Ellie Haddington recalled her time working on The Cafe, a Sky One sitcom which aired in . It starred The Royle Familys Ralf Little alongside Haddington and Littles co-writer Michelle Terry. But it was another cast member, then an unknown -year-old actress, who particularly caught Haddingtons eye. \"I can remember looking at her,\" she said, \"and thinking: My God, what an extraordinary inidual.\" The inidual in question was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, in her first major role.Fast forward eight years and the London-born polymath has the world at her feet, particularly the part that houses the gilded constituencies that hand out Emmys and Golden Globes. The  Golden Globe ceremony is on January  in Beverly Hills and Waller-Bridge is up for two awards. Ten days later shell be honoured at the Screen Actors Guild Awards where shes nominated in two categories. Andshe flies home laden with mantelpiece accessories it wont be the first time ndash she scooped three Golden Globes at last years award as well as three Primetime Emmys.If not, well theres the not insignicant matter of the th James Bond film, No Time to Die, to be released in April. Waller-Bridge co-wrote the script and great things are expected. Of coursetheres one production on which Waller-Bridges name is indelibly stamped its Fleabag, written by and starring her as a young Londoner navigating family, work, sex and relationships with brutal honesty and unsettling humour.Starting out as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh Fringe, it was turned into a TV series in  but was dropped quietly onto BBC Three, then only available online. But word-of-mouth is still a powerful tool even in our digital age and by the summer it had been relaunched on BBC Four. The rest is television history: when we look back at this decades television, well be splitting it into pre and post-Fleabag.Even more interestingly, Waller-Bridge followed that triumph with one of the career curve-balls weve now come to expect: an adaptation of Luke Jenningss Villanelle spy novel series. Retitled Killing Eve it was fresh, funny, thrillingly violent and gratuitously fashion-forward, and made a star of lead actress Jodie Comer, whose pink Molly Godard tulle dress became the go-to Halloween costume for hipsters everywhere. And, of course, it hauled in yet more gongs for its writer.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesWill it be third time lucky with No Time to Die  Dont ever bet against Phoebe Waller-Bridge.BARRY DIDCOCKANDY MURRAY, TENNIS PLAYERSmall, wet, overweight countries should not ndash and usually do not ndash produce tennis superstars. As only those from other small countries can appreciate ndash the Jamaicans and Swiss, perhaps ndash possessing a global sports hero somehow makes your whole nation stand a little taller.Thats exactly what Andy Murray has done for Scotland . Is there any feeling comparable to the buzz of watching Murray play a big match, willing him to win with every demented fibre of your mind and body  I think not.And yet the Dunblane-born champion is not only from Scotland, but very much of his homeland. During the late Noughties, the young, gangly, wild-haired Murray thrilled us with his impressive Wimbledon runs. But as the years went on and he just missed out on a slew of grand slam trophies, many English media outlets and tennis fans took against him, decrying the sweary intensity and dry Scottish banter. This only made Scots love him more, of course.Eventually, with patience, maturity, courage and sheer hard graft came the top honours in tennis ndash the US Open, two Wimbledon singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, the Davis Cup, the coveted world number one spot ndash and global adulation.But as much as he grew as a sportsman, whats equally remarkable about Murray is how he grew as person. Indeed, it is his openness, humanity and humility, the way he speaks out against sexism in tennis, that make him a true hero, loved by his peers and the public, rather than simply respected.A devastating hip injury ndash and subsequent resurfacing operation ndash nearly ended Murrays career, and his recent comeback has been both painful and inspiring to watch.Murray taught Scots to dream big. But the father of three also taught Scots men, in particular, showing your feelings, being true to yourself, makes you a bigger man in every way.MARIANNE TAYLORJEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEOThe worlds richest man is fond of reminding people that he started Amazon in his garage. A company that is now worth more than pound trillion and employs in the region of , people began with Bezos packing books and taking them to the post office himself.Like Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg and Twitters Jack Dorsey, Bezos grasped early on the potential of the internet. That realisation has had huge consequences. Amazon has transformed shopping, helped hollow out the high street, and led to a fortune for its creator estimated at poundbn.That has allowed him to set up his own space exploration company and buy the Washington Post .Bezoss success cant be gainsayed, but at what cost  Employees have bitterly complained about working conditions, the EU is investigating the company for anti-trust violations and earlier this year it had to scrap plans to build a second headquarters in New York when local politicians questioned why a company making bna month should receive taxpayers cash to move to the city.Oh yes, and it was also revealed that the company had not paid any income tax in the US the previous year. Or the year before that. You dont get to be the richest man in the world by giving anything away, obviously.TEDDY JAMIESONDAVID BOWIE, MUSICIANIn the months after his death at the start of , as Britain voted for Brexit and America voted for Donald Trump, there was a spate of tweets wonderingBowies absence was now one of the reasons why everything was going to hell in a handcart.\"Im not saying that David Bowie was holding the fabric of the universe together, but *gestures broadly at everything*\" tweeted blogger Katie Liewy with tongue firmly in cheek in June that year.Whether his influence actually stretched that far, theres no doubt that culturally this decade was Bowies, in the same way as the s belonged to the Beatles. As Oasis looked to Lennon and McCartney in the mid-s, Bowie became the touchstone for any musician ndash from FKA Twigs to St Vincent ndash in the s who wanted to push the odd boundary.But none of them did it as well as the original, who ed at the start of , after almost a decade in which he had withdrawn from public view. He released a new single, Where Are We Now , on his birthday without any warning. It presaged a new album, The Next Day, and a VA retrospective, David Bowie Is. Three years later he released an album, Blackstar, on his th birthday. Two days later his death was announced. It was ashe was curating his own end.:From the death of Bowie to the rise of grime: The decade in pop musicFor anyone who knew him in the middle of the s the fact that Bowie avoided being a rock n roll casualty must have seemed a miracle given his copious drug intake back then.Instead, he weaned himself off them, created some of the most memorable and potent music of the late th century, reinvented himself as a mainstream pop star in the s, then became an elder statesman who embraced everything from drum n bass to the internet before his final st-century flourish.His is one of the great stories in pop and in  it came to a tragic yet magnicent conclusion.TEDDY JAMIESONELON MUSK, TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURThe chronicles of self-styled maverick billionaire Elon Musk never fail to fascinate. Among his outlandish adventures and madcap musings, we have Elon and the space car Elon and the Thai cave rescue Elon and the dead gorilla novelty rap Elon and his plan to nuke Mars.South African-born Musk first pricked the public consciousness as a technology entrepreneur, investor and engineer in  when, aged , he sold his web software company, Zip, to Compaq for  million .He continued to ascend his field throughout the Noughties, but it is in the last decade that Musk has become a household name for his roles as founder chief engineer designer of SpaceX and the CEO product architect at Tesla.Granted, this is often more down to calamity than plaudits for his innovative work. Such as the cringe-inducing moment during a recent unveiling for the new Tesla Cybertruck when, demonstrating how tough the \"armour glass\" of the windows was to break, they were duly smashed.Or when he referred to British er Vernon Unsworth ndash who helped rescue  Thai boys trapped in a flooded underwater cave in  ndash as \"pedo guy\" on Twitter .Then theres Musks lofty plans to \"nuke Mars\" ndash which he describes as \"a fixer upper of a planet\" ndash suggesting that nuclear bombs should be detonated at its poles to melt the ice caps and allow it to sufficiently heat up for humans to dwell there.And the head-scratching moment when he dropped a track on SoundCloud called RIP Harambe, a heavily auto-tuned song about the Cincinnati Zoo gorilla whose death in  sparked a global outpouring of grief and anger.Sure, Musk sometimes loses credibility due to his more leftfield thinking ndash such as a belief that were all probably living in a giant computer simulation like The Matrix or a Sims-style game controlled by superior beings ndash but there is no denying that hes a clever guy who shouldnt be underestimated.If this is a simulation, we cant wait to see what our overlords get him to do next.SUSAN SWARBRICKMEGHAN MARKLE, DUCHESS OF SUSSEXSurely it wasnt meant to be like this. If you become a fairy tale princess can you not then expect to live happily ever after That hasnt been the case for Meghan Markle. Yes, she had the royal wedding last year attended by the great and the good and the merely famous. Yes, she got a title, a handsome prince and a royal baby . Not what she must have expected growing up a mixed-race kid in Los Angeles.And yet since the wedding there has found herself a constant target of the tabloid press. She recently filed a lawsuit against the Mail on Sunday for publishing a private letter to her estranged father. It also prompted her husband Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, to condemn the medias \"relentless propaganda\" which was, he said, often \"knowingly  and malicious\" in a public statement announcing the legal action.His anger is perhaps understandable given the paparazzis involvement in the death of his mother. \"Every single time I see a camera, every single time I hear a click, every single time I see a flash, it takes me straight back,\" he admitted this year.The Duchess of Sussexs major crime would appear to be that she has \"opinions\". There is a class of media commentator ndash mouthy, reactionary and perhaps most importantly white ndash who is offended by her feminism and likes to moan about the couples \"wokeness\". It has prompted \"the Queen\", or, rather, the TV version of the monarch, Olivia Colman, star of The Crown, to speak out against the critics.:From Leonard Bernsteinrsquos MASS to the GRIT Orchestra, Keith Bruces musical picks of the decade\"I dont know why theyre so mean to a fellow human being,\" Coleman said of the press coverage.Or maybe we simply have to accept there is no such thing as happy ever after.TEDDY JAMIESONGRETA THUNBERG, ENVIRONMENTAL CAMPAIGNER\"My name is Greta,\" a Swedish schoolgirl wrote on her flyers in . \"I am in ninth grade, and I am school-striking for the climate. Since you adults dont give a damn about my future, I wont either.\"Its hard to believe that it has only been just over a year since Thunberg ndash recognised now simply as \"Greta\" to millions ndash made her viral UN speech in Poland, saying, \"You say you love your children above all . And yet you are stealing their future in front of their very eyes.\"Thunberg may only have made her stamp in the final year of the decade, but at just  years old she has done more to provoke an attitude sht on environment than anyone, and she began it by skipping school.Her words and actions have woken millions of schoolchildren, four million of whom went on strike from school on September , as well as adults, to the science-backed threat of the climate emergency. On what is arguably the biggest issue of our time, hers is the voice that has led, upbraiding those in leadership. Margaret Atwood called her the Joan of Arc of environmentalism. Donald Trump told her to \"chill\". Collins Dictionary made \"climate strike\" its word of the year.Why did people listen to her, when others saying the same were ignored  Perhaps because of who she was ndash not an adult, scientist, politician or expert ndash and how she, a teenager with Aspergers Syndrome, delivered her message, politely, yet angrily and without softenings.To the UN General Assembly, in September, she said: \"We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you.\" She has started a powerful movement. The question is whether necessary change will follow. Can we alter the ending of this terrying nightmare  Thunberg dares us to.VICKY ALLANNICOLA STURGEON, FIRST MINISTER OF SCOTLANDBy the time Nicola Sturgeon became Scotlands first female First Minister in , at the age of , she had already been involved in politics for more than a quarter of a century.She joined the SNP in her native Ayrshire ndash then a Labour bastion ndash aged  at the height of the Thatcher years. It was the decisive first step on a journey that would transform not only the young Sturgeon but the fortunes of her party, and, ultimately, the political landscape in Scotland.After becoming an MSP in , Sturgeon, a solicitor by trade, impressed from the outset, serving in two shadow cabinets. In , she was elected deputy party leader to Alex Salmond during his second stint as party leader. The partnership was successful and in  the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, paving the way for s independence referendum.When Salmond resigned as SNP leader and First Minister in the aftermath of the Yes campaigns loss, Sturgeon was the obvious choice to replace him.:From Frozen to  Years a Slave, the best films of the last  yearsThe five years since have seen tumultuous change in UK politics, with Sturgeon growing in stature as politician and stateswoman, both in UK and European terms, even in the eyes of many who do not share her stance on independence. She regularly appears in glossy magazine lists of the worlds most influential women.During the recent General Election campaign her clear opposition to Brexit and impressive performances in TV debates ndash not to mention her lively Twitter feed ndash won her a whole new legion of fans in England, particularly among women. Will Sturgeon lead Scotland to independence in the s  That remains to be seen. Regardless, her place in Scottish history, as politician and role model, is guaranteed.MARIANNE TAYLORBARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATESThings might look dferent now. In , at the end of Barack Obamas second term in office, when commentators looked back at his legacy as president, there was a sense that his achievements were, at best, mixed.True, he had withdrawn US soldiers from Iraq, improved relations with Cuba, reached a nuclear deal with Iran and introduced Obamacare.Set against that, though, he escalated American military involvement in Afghanistan, increased drone strikes in Pakistan, saw wealth and income inequality rocket under his watch. Guantanamo Bay was still in operation when he left office and though he spoke out in favour of gun control he didnt manage to introduce it.Obama could point to Republican obstruction in the House of Congress. Even so there was a whf of missed opportunities about his presidency. Perhaps that was inevitable. In the end a centrist president was never going to live up to the utopian notions so many Americans projected on to him during the  election campaign.And yet, in retrospect, perhaps his achievements are growing. What has been missed over the last four years is his articulacy, eloquence, wit and normality.In part its because he represents the antithesis of what came after. An inarticulate, narcissistic, racist, corrupt old man whose first term has been a skip fire of the vanities ending in a vote for impeachment. Obama for all his failings always felt like he was an adult in the room. Can you say the same of Donald Trump TEDDY JAMIESONKIM KARDASHIAN WEST, REALITY TV STAR AND ENTREPRENEURLove her or loathe her, there is no denying that Kim Kardashian West ripped up the rule book in her rise to becoming a world-famous reality star with a multi-million-dollar business empire and a global fanbase.Having first found peripheral fame as a friend and stylist to heiress Paris Hilton in the early s, Kardashian West gained notoriety after the release of her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray J in . That same year, the familys reality TV series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, began airing.While the naysayers reckoned it would be a fleeting  minutes of fame, Kardashian West pulled off a shrewd and unparalleled move: she utilised social media to make herself into a brand. Today, her Midas touch extends across fashion, fragrances and cosmetics to television, books, gaming, and even law and politics. Oh, and she is queen of the selfie.An exaggerated hourglass figure and cartoonishly large backside have become a trademark for Kardashian West, garnering as many ndash and often more ndash column inches as her entrepreneurial ventures.: The best visual arts of the last  years, by Jan Patience and Sarah Urwin JonesIndeed, when Kardashian West posed for a  cover of Paper magazine with her rear bared and oiled up like a Greek wrestler, it saw a new phrase \"break the internet\" coined, referring to the frenzy that the images sparked.That same year, she joined her husband, the rapper Kanye West, for a landmark cover on Vogue magazine. \"There are a lot of firsts,\" Kardashian West said at the time. \"Kanyes the first rapper to be on, Im the first reality person to be on, were the first interracial couple.\"She continues to surprise people. Earlier this year, Kardashian West announced she was following in her late fathers footsteps by studying to become a lawyer .Kardashian West ndash who boasts  million social media followers on Instagram alone ndash seems determined to use her  and stratospheric public profilefor good, visiting US president Donald Trump at the Oval Office last year to discuss justice reform.She successfully lobbied Trump to grant clemency to Alice Johnson, a -year-old woman who spent  years in an Alabama prison, without parole, for a non-violent, first-time drug offence. Johnson was released in  and Kardashian West has vowed to tackle other miscarriage of justices.Her work to date makes for impressive reading. But in the scheme of things, one could argue that Kardashian West is only just getting started. With her husband having announced he intends to run for US president in , a decade from now this might all seem like small fry.SUSAN SWARBRICKSTORMZY, RAPPERWhy is Stormzy one of the most influential public figures of the last decade  There are  people you could ask ndash  black students who were admitted to Cambridge University in . Thats up about  per cent more than the  who started courses in .Not all of it is down to Stormzy, but a lot of it may be. In , the grime artist announced he would be paying the tuition fees and maintenance grants of two black Cambridge students, and this year he said hed be paying for two more. Its called the Stormzy Scholarship and now theyre calling the rise in the number of black students at Cambridge the Stormzy Effect.The question is: can the effect spread  Theres still a huge gap between the chances of going to university in the UKyoure white and well-off and the chances of goingyoure black or youre poor or youre both and some argue universities will have to offer places to poorer students with lower grades to start making a dference. But the good news, thanks to Stormzy, is that black students now make up more than three per cent of new undergrads at Cambridge for the first time.Stormzy has had another effect too, and perhaps its one that will be even more profound. Rappers have traditionally had a bit of an image problem: theyve usually promoted out-of-school activities rather than in-school ones. But Stormzys dferent. \"It sounds corny coming from a rapper,\" he says, \"but I did love learning and I loved studying.\" The Stormzy Effect could inspire many others to feel the same.MARK SMITHSIMONE BILES, GYMNASTOnce in a letime ndashyoure very lucky ndash theres a sporting star who shines so brightly that they eclipse everything that has come before.Step forward Simone Biles. The US gymnasts talent and achievements are such that we humble observers have long since exhausted the superlatives.While the gymternet ndash as the online community of gymnastics fans are known ndash has been abuzz about Biles for years, it was at the Rio  Olympic Games that the rest of the world sat up and took notice.: From Our Ladies of Perpetual Succour to What Girls Are Made of, five standout theatre shows of the decadeBiles, who won four golds and a bronze, found herself repeatedly compared to a raft of male sporting greats asthat is the only way we could comprehend her colossal achievements. \"Im not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps,\" she responded. \"Im the first Simone Biles.\"The -year-old from Texas burst onto the global gymnastics scene in , winning her debut world all-around gold in Antwerp. It is a title that Biles has claimed on four further occasions , alongside a raft of inidual apparatus medals.In October, Biles took her th medal, making her the most decorated gymnast ndash male or female ndash in world championship history .But it is not only in a competition arena that Biles proved herself a gargantuan presence. In January , she released a statement on Twitter confirming that former USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar had sexually assaulted her under the guise of medical treatment.Nassar was later sentenced to up to  years in prison after more than  women stood up in court and laid bare their own experiences of sexual abuse in a scandal spanning three decades.Biles and her fellow survivors were awarded the Arthur Ashe Courage Award. At the  US National Championships, she designed and wore a teal leotard ndash a colour used to raise awareness about sexual abuse.A vocal critic of the US Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to the allegations against Nassar, Biles continues to lobby for better accountability from both governing bodies.She refuses to be defined by what happened. Biless willingness to push the boundaries of her sport remains unabated. At the  US Gymnastics Championships, she stepped out in a crystal-studded leotard bearing her surname above an embroidered image of a goats head.It was a nod to the acronym GOAT, which is shorthand for the Greatest of All Time. Far from being boastful, however, this was Biless tongue-in-cheek \"jab back\" at the \"haters\" .She has the goods to back it up. This year Biles had two gymnastics skills ndash a hugely dficult triple twisting-double somersault in her floor routine and double-double dismount from beam ndash named in her honour after she became the first woman to perform them. Both appear to defy gravity.The Tokyo  Olympic Games loom on the horizon. Simone Biles is far from done yet.SUSAN SWARBRICKABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADIHe was the most wanted terrorist in the world. For more than half of the last decade, no single figure caused more chaos in the Middle East than Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri. For that was his real name, even though the world came to know him by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.As the decade began al-Baghdadi had already served four years in the sprawling US military detention centre called Camp Bucca, which had detained some of the Iraq Wars most radical jihadists. In political and religious terms he was already a long way from his days as a PhD student of Islamic Studies at university in Baghdad.By , clad in black robes and standing in the pulpit of a mosque in Iraqs second city of Mosul, he was already claiming the title caliph of the Muslim world and leadership of the infamous Islamic Stategroup.Few even then could have imagined the chaos, carnage and suffering that al -Baghdadi, born one of six children in , would wreak on the world.:Books of the decade: From Harper Lee and Hilary Mantel to EL JamesIt would not be until October , , in a raid carried out by US Special Forces, when al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide vest in the Syrian province of Idlib, that the world was rid of his malign presence.\"We killed the last murderous bastard who ran IS, lets go get the next one,\" proclaimed one tough-talking US Republican Senator in the wake of al- Baghdadis death.But in the tunnels and booby traps left behind in cities like Mosul and Raqqa to the mass graves and thousands of faceless, black-clad female followers haunting refugee camps, ISs presence remains palpable along with its new new leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.Many IS fighters now languish in prisons, but thousands more remain at large re-grouping and organising while their franchises likewise operate across the globe. This is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadis lingering and still menacing legacy.DAVID PRATT, CONTRIBUTING FOREIGN EDITORBOB SERVANT, BURGER TYCOONAh, Bob Servant. How do we love thee  Let us count the ways.

Half-baked publicity stunts coupled with glowing obituaries to tinpot dictators.Dundee-born Neil Forsyth is the man who breathed le into the incorrigible comic creation, first as a series of books, then a BBC Radio Scotland adaptation and latterly a BBC Four sitcom with Brian Cox in the titular role.Recent years have seen the Broughty Ferry burger don ndash who has been declared a \"national treasure\" ndash become a social media sensation, amassing a loyal Twitter following as he imparts inimitable pearls of wisdom as part of his frank and forthright narrative on le.As well as running Bobs Twitter account, Forsyth penned the hit BBC Scotland drama Guilt, which aired this autumn, and was given five stars by The Heralds TV critic Alison Rowat, who described it as \"the most impressive small screen debut since Tutti Frutti\".SUSAN SWARBRICKCAITLYN JENNER, TELEVISION PERSONALITY AND TRANSGENDER ACTIVISTFor gay people, the last  years have been the decade of change after a century of virtually none. Public opinion has become ever more supportive. LGBT people have become ever more visible. And in , gay marriage was made legal in most of the UK.Then theres the T in LGBT. A few days ago, the Scottish Government published a draft bill which will simply the process of trans men and women having their gender legally recognised, but its not been an easy path. Some feminists say the legislation will undermine the rights of women. Trans activists say a change in the law is the only way to end the demeaning legal and medical process trans people currently have to endure. The two sides have not always been nice to each other.What the debate, and the bitterness, may prove is there is still some distance to go to LGBT equality, but the fact we got closer in the last decade is in large part due to its trans pioneers and one pioneer in particular. You know what Im talking about andnot, you should: the cover of Vanity Fair in June . Caitlyn Jenner. Former Olympic athlete. Openly transgender woman.For Jenner, the photograph was an act of happiness. \"Im so happy after such a long struggle to be living my true self,\" she said when the magazine was published. \"Welcome to the world Caitlyn.\" And for those who saw the picture, it was an act of courage and activism. When is equality  When trans people are in parliaments, and in churches, and in governments, and on the cover of fashion magazines.MARK SMITHDONALD TRUMP, BORIS JOHNSON, NIGEL FARAGE AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, POPULIST POLITICIANSVladimir Putin is about to mark  years in power ndash he first became Russian president on December ,  ndash and for much of that time the West has looked at his style ndash authoritarian, bombastic and a little bit silly ndash and thought: thank God were not like that.But that was then. First, a man with a fag in his mouth ndash call me Nigel ndash became leader of Ukip and the Brexit Party. Then a man with a phone in his hand ndash call me Donald ndash became president of the United States. And then a man with an inappropriate phrase on the tip of his tongue ndash call me Boris ndash became Prime Minister of the UK.Its not a coincidence they are known by their Christian names. Nigel, Donald and Boris represent a new, first-names-only style of politics that has dominated America and the UK in the last  years: populist, chummy, big on rhetoric, light on detail, and ndash much to the frustration of liberals ndash effective at attracting votes. Those three men have attracted support from working class voters who have traditionally looked to the left for answers. In the last  years, though, theyve looked right, and the result is Nigel, Donald and Boris.The next decade will decide their fate. Arguably, Farage has already been neutered after the Brexit Partys dismal election campaign. But the fates of Trump and Johnson are less certain. Trump has been impeached and will face a trial in the Senate, but its controlled by the Republicans, who arent going to vote their man out. As for Johnson, hes just won a big, blue majority and, failing a cock-uphes going to be here for the next five years.Beware:  years of populism may become .MARK SMITHPROFESSOR PETER HIGGS, SCIENTISTScience always plays the long game. It took almost a century for scientists in  to prove Einsteins  predictions of gravitational waves in space, which formed part of his theory of general relativity. Professor Peter Higgs didnt have to wait quite that long.Back in , while teaching at Edinburgh University, Higgs published papers predicting the existence of a particle that gave mass to the most basic building blocks of matter. It soon became known as the Higgs Boson. Much to his dismay, it was also called the God particle.No-one could find it, however. Or not until , when the large hadron collider near Geneva finally proved its existence.A year later Higgs, then , won the Nobel Prize in Physics, sharing the prize with fellow scientist Francois Englert.Higgs decided to go on holiday when the prize was announced, neglecting to take his mobile phone with him in a bid to avoid being pestered by journalists. They could wait. He had, after all.TEDDY JAMIESONEL JAMES, AUTHORThere was a moment, in the summer of , where everywhere you looked someone had their nose in a copy Fty Shades of Grey. Its racy themes became the subject of countless water cooler chats, school run tete-a-tetes and whispered conversations over the garden fence.The erotic novel by EL James has been crowned bestselling book of the decade.

Kids shouting to one another and woman up on the stage with an old piano.\"You didnt know the time - there was no children with a watch. The only time you knew that the picture was coming on was when the attendant came around dimming the lights.\"The big cheer went up aw this is it! There was a few comedy pictures - Buster Keaton and that - and then it came to the cowboy picture, the Desperado Dude.\"The -year-old recalls the moment the tragedy unfolded, saying it was just as the films hero rode to the villains den to rescue free the captured heroine.He said: \"The film cut short and was smoke at the back of the hall. It began to come into the room and somebody shouted fire, and everybody panicked except me.\"What happened was that the people at the front of the hall ran to the back where there was an exit door.

I dont know what that would have done to her.\"Just a few days later, on the fourth of January , a steady procession of small white coffins marked Paisleyrsquos day of mourning.The disaster sparked headlines across the world and led to changes in the law which ensured that cinemas would have more exits and that escape doors were to be fitted with push bars that opened outwards, which are still in place to this day.A limitation was also placed on the capacity of cinemas and a requirement for an appropriate number of adult attendants to ensure safety of children.Fellow survivor Emily Brown was just five when she was caught up in crush in the cinema, and was rescued when she was pulled through a smashed window by a firefighter.The -year-old, who had gone to the Glen Cinema with her older sister jean and three-year-old little sister Mary, said: \"We all panicked and tried to get to the door, but the door was locked from the outside that day.

Thirty years after it was named the first European City of Culture, it has in recent times hosted the Commonwealth Games and the BBC Six Music Festival as well as lining up alongside Berlin to stage the  European Championships. In the year ahead it, just like global cities including Amsterdam, Copenhagen, London and Rome, will host a number of matches for UEFArsquos European Football Championship and will also welcome world leaders to COP , a global climate change summit.Not bad for a city that in  was seen as so scarred by poverty, infirmity and other vestiges of its industrial past that even its own citizens questioned the rationale for choosing it over practically anywhere  as a European cultural capital.The transformation has not come easy, though. A city does not attract high-profile events in a bubble and major businesses like Barclays, which is currently building a hub on the banks of the Clyde, do not choose to create thousands of jobs in a place without discussion. Everything that has happened to Glasgow in the past three decades has happened because of the considerable effort put in by its political leaders as well as representatives of its and Scotlandrsquos business, sporting and cultural communities. They might have spent a bit of public money attending meetings, making contacts and preparing bids - they might even have spent a lot - but considering what the city has got insurely we can all agree it has been money well spent Well, no. Because faced with evidence of the seemingly profligate spending of Glasgow City Councilrsquos deputy leader David McDonald, representatives of opposition parties have declared themselves up in arms. The problem is that in addition to visiting schools, housing developments and local museums, Mr McDonald went on a number of publicly funded trips this year, with visits to Tokyo, Tallinn and Duumlsseldorf among them.Tokyo was to attend the opening of an exhibition of  works from Glasgowrsquos publicly owned Burrell Collection Tallinn was to rub shoulders with other civic leaders at the Estonian national song festival, an event Mr McDonald had been invited to as a representative of a UNESCO City of Music and Duumlsseldorf was to take part in an international summit on social cohesiveness on the invitation of the mayor of Montreal.Yet despite Glasgow working so hard to earn its emerging status as a global city - and despite the obvious advantages attending such events can bring - these were seen as beyond the pale. Conservative MSP Annie Wells reckoned Glaswegians ldquowill be understandably annoyed that an SNP councillor is spending so much of their money on this truly international class of junketing Gary Smith, Scottish secretary of staunch Labour-supporting union the GMB, agreed. ldquoGlasgow council-tax payers will be aghast at this councillorrsquos excesses, he fumed. ldquoThe cityrsquos infrastructure is decrepit, the streets are dirty and there are budget cuts affecting the elderly and vulnerable.Gary Smith does, of course, have a point. Like every other local authority in the country Glasgow City Council has been struggling with budgetary constraints whose effects are plain for all to see. Walk down any street and the filth is astonishing, with the absence of blocked drains, overflowing bins and dog dirt more remarkable than their presence. At the same time, the council is failing so miserably to meet its obligations to house everyone presenting as homeless that it has been placed under review by the Scottish Government, threatened with legal action by homelessness charity Shelter and been made the subject of an inquiry by the Scottish Housing Regulator. The city has its problems, alright, and then some.Yet damning as those and many other issues are, none of that will be solved by the city turning in on itself. Far from this being the time for Glasgowrsquos leaders to hunker down and worry solely about how to cope with shrinking budgets, this is precisely the moment the city should be selling itself on the global stage, using the confidence it has gained over the past  years to attract the kind of investment that will at least give it the opportunity to thrive.To suggest that politicians like Mr McDonald should snub invitations to build international links on the basis that all foreign trips are junkets is small minded in the extreme. It does nothing to address the very real issues Glasgow faces, but does plenty to damage the mature, confident, outward-looking image the city has worked so hard to create.The artist and author Alasdair Gray, whose death at the weekend has left an unimaginable hole in Scotlandrsquos cultural landscape, wrote repeatedly about Glasgowrsquos magnicence and to a large extent it was him who helped shape our recognition and understanding of that. As he had the character Duncan Thaw say in his masterwork Lanark, unless a city has been used by an artist ldquonot even the inhabitants live there imaginatively. ldquoThink of Florence, Paris, London, New York, the character said. ldquoNobody visiting them for the first time is a stranger because hersquos already visited them in paintings, novels, history books and films.Alasdair Grayrsquos books and drawings, murals and poems have helped elevate Glasgow into the kind of city its inhabitants are proud to live in and whose visitors feel no strangeness in. Our civic leaders have a duty not just to nurture that legacy but to develop it too.Sure Glasgow has problems with potholes and cleanliness, homelessness and drug addiction, but Tory politicians and Labour-soaked unions are wrongthey think that public funds should be spent on fixing that and that alone. Glasgow has earned the right to host events and exhibitions that will play a part in its future prosperity, but its leaders have had to work hard for that - and not just in the City Chambers. To suggest otherwise displays a stunning lack of imagination."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-say-scotlands-smacking-ban-place-heavy-burden-social-workers","story":"A new survey of Scottish councillors also suggests a general lack of support for the controversial ban across local authority representatives of all main parties.The research, carried out by a group which argues against the smacking ban, claims three in four councillors who responded do not believe their council has the resources to handle the additional pressure that a smacking ban may bring.In addition, seven in  say social workers would fail to cope with extra caseloads created by the law, set to be introduced in the coming year.The survey also claims most councillors believe parents should be allowed to use reasonable chastisement, and that smacking should not become a criminal offence.Holyrood voted in October by  to  to support Scottish Greensrsquo MSP John Finniersquos anti-smacking bill which outlaws all physical punishment of children and raises the prospect of parents being prosecuted for any use of physical punishment on their own children.The legislation was given Royal Assent last month and is due to come into force in the coming year. It means Scotland will be the first UK country to outlaw smacking and will give young people the same protection from assault as adults.A consultation on Mr Finniersquos bill was widely supported by childrenrsquos charities however opponents have argued that the law already protected children from assault and the ban risked criminalising lsquogood parentsrsquo for using reasonable chastisement.It has been likened by some opponents to the Scottish Governmentrsquos failed lsquonamed personsrsquo legislation which was ditched following criticism that it could place ordinary families under undue scrutiny.The new research by campaign group Be Reasonable received  responses from  Scottish councillors, representing % of the countryrsquos local councillors.Despite claims that the survey is too small to be reliable, the group says it spotlights a deep ide between the views of local politicians and Holyrood.It also warns that while the law change could see increased pressure on social services and a need for extra training for teachers and health workers, there has so far been no indication that the Scottish Government plans to release funds to help cover additional costs.Be Reasonable spokesman Jamie Gillies, said: ldquoThree-quarters of councillors who completed the survey felt local authorities will not cope with additional pressures brought about by a change in the law.ldquoCrucially, social workers ndash who are already cracking under the pressure of identying and helping vulnerable children ndash are also thought to be unable to cope.ldquoMany councillors seem aghast at the prospect of a smacking ban which would tie up social workers, deplete local authority resources and affect services for years to come when there is no reliable evidence to show that mild physical discipline is harmful to children.ldquoWhen signicant numbers of councillors in all of the main parties oppose legislation the Government should take notice.The survey claims seven in  councillors think parents should be allowed to use reasonable chastisement on their children. A similar number do not think smacking should become a criminal offence.While only the Scottish Conservatives opposed the bill in Holyrood, the survey suggests half of SNP and Lib Dem councillors who responded agree that parents should be permitted to use reasonable chastisement with their children. The numbers were higher among Labourand Conservative .Meanwhile, more than seven in  councillors felt the Government should finance the implications of a smacking ban ldquoas fully as necessary over time and provide ldquopublic assurances that no other frontline services will be affected as a consequence of the Bill erting resources.According to Be Reasonable responses to the survey from councillors suggests confusion over how the smacking ban might work, with one apparently unclear over whether the new law would apply to foreign tourists and another raising concerns that it may lead to family disputes and unproven allegations.One councillor commented that ldquosomeneed a quick, harmless smack on the leg or bottom to save them from harm, while another raised concerns that the legislation is ldquooverly heavy-handed and is not proportionate to the issue.Others raised concerns over the extra workload for police and social services, with one commenting: ldquoAs usual with Scottish Government, they will simply pass the buck to hard-pressed local authorities, as they have with so many other subjects.ldquoIf they want this it must be fully resourced out of their annual underspend.Responding to the survey, Scottish Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said: ldquoItrsquos typical of the SNP to rush through a headline-grabbing law without thinking about the consequences.ldquoThe Nationalists were well-warned about these challenges but blundered on regardless.ldquoNow we have a situation where the SNP is creating criminals of ordinary parents and placing immense pressure on council services which are already struggling to cope.Childrenrsquos Minister Maree Todd said: ldquoThe Act gives children, without exception, the same protection from assault as adults.ldquoThis is backed by an overwhelming majority of public opinion and commanded support from a wide range of Scottish society including the Church of Scotland, Scottish Womenrsquos Aid, the Royal College of Paediatrics  Child Health , Children First and Barnardorsquos.ldquoWe are working in partnership with organisations including local authorities, childrenrsquos charities, Social Work Scotland and Police Scotland to raise awareness of the Act and build on the existing support we offer to children and families."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-reassures-eu-citizens-new-year-message","story":"The First Minister highlighted theUN climate change summit in Glasgow in November as key date for the year ahead, which she said would give Scotland the chance to show it is leading by example.Addressing the UKrsquos scheduled exit from the EU in January, the SNP leader sought to reassure EU citizens and said the Scottish Government would work towards giving people the opportunity to ldquodetermine Scotlandrsquos future.:Nicola Sturgeon lsquoshowboatingrsquo instead of fixing public services, opposition claimldquoAs we celebrate the start of  and a new decade, we look forward to a year in which Scotland will be at the centre of international attention, she said.ldquoIn November, the United Nations climate change summit in Glasgow will attract more than , people from around the world.ldquoHopefully that summit will lead to progress in tackling the most important issue that the world faces.ldquoAnd it will give Scotland a chance to show that we are leading by example ndash not just by reducing our greenhouse gas emissions but by doing so in a way that helps to build a fairer, healthier and happier society.The First Minister added:ldquoThe Glasgow summit comes near the end of what will be a historic year.ldquoAgainst the wishes of most people in Scotland, we will leave the European Union at the end of January.

Her guests earlier in the evening, James Cosmoand Mark Bonnar , had been joined by Line of Dutyrsquos Martin Compston and Jane McCarry of Still Game. Tame banter followed.The hard work was being done by Clarke in Edinburgh and Irons in Stonehaven. Irons was shouty and hoarse, but at least she was animated. Clarke was confident and competent, though he was rather ahead of the crowd on the big countdown.Back indoors, Travis continued to play the studio gig like it was a corporate event, with the audience standing around like some middle aged Top of the Pops crowd who were missing their beds.As for the rest of it, particularly the Calman end of things, where was the jeopardy, the excitement, the raw buzz of a truly live gig  The only part that offered genuine bangs for the viewerrsquos buck were the fireworks after the bells. Otherwise, this was a Hogmanay show that felt like it had been cooked earlier and was being reheated on the night.Oh Jackie, you were missed.Stand by for an important announcement. Clear small children and pets from the area, secure breakable objects and make grannyrsquos a double. Ready  Good people of Scotland, Only an Excuse is funny again.Now, let us not get carried away here. Post-appendectomy patients watching were in no danger of bursting their stitches. But my God, the relief. How many years have we sat through half an hour of excruciating humourlessness with a rictus grin on our collective coupon, only to come away disappointed Changes had been made, notably drafting in extra bodies so that Jonathan Watson did not have to carry the show alone. Smart move. Even Eric had his Ernie. Watson was joined by Mark Cox, Joy McAvoy, Louise McCarthy and Alex Norton. Yes, wummin were there, and not just to be the object of lame Frank McAvennie gags. There was even a wummin in the ten-strong writing team. Just one, but it is a start. Theyrsquoll be letting one run the country next.A couple of sketches aside , the strongest material had nothing to do with football. Someone commission Cruachan Hydro Electric Power Station, Scotlandrsquos answer to Chernobyl, now.Sure, there were still some mirth-free stretches and misfires, but this was Scots comedy tailored for a Scots audience more importantly it was funny.Jack Docherty is a cheeky article. Researchers on Selling Scotland, a look at how the country has been depicted in ads down the years, had unearthed one of the first recorded Scottish commercials. Dated  and shown in American cinemas, it featured a gang of kilt-wearing teuchters selling whisky.ldquoThis strange, grainy clip, said the Scot Squad star, ldquois last yearrsquos STV Hogmanay special. Cheeky, but on the money. When it comes to Hogmanay, STVrsquos offerings in recent years have been televisual mince. Last year Lulu was wheeled out for a ldquoHogmanay Hooley that had all the atmosphere of a flu jab session in your local GPsrsquo surgery, and who can forget the year Elaine C Smith welcomed in the New Year with Nicola Sturgeon in a recreated s living room  Oh, the banter.In Seanrsquos Very Scottish Hogmanay the Sean in question was Batty, not Connery. Weatherman of the STV parish, Sean is licensed to tell you when it is going to bucket down.The location for the party, Craufurdland Castle in Ayrshire, was a cut above. Gold star for the production team on that one, eventhe rather snug surroundings made it look as though we were dropping in on the smallest ceilidh in the world.Dressed in full kilt with accessorising earpiece, Sean took to the part of host with his trademark big daft laddie gusto. Besides interviewing the laird and his we, he had been out and about filming segments on Hogmanay traditions. In the Borders he made black bun, and in Dundee he watched two women put a dress on a herring. Something to do with ensuring the family fish barrel would always be full, or so they told him.Meanwhile, back in the castle, Seanrsquos presenting partner, Jenner Reoch, was learning what the Craufurd family ate in olden days . ldquoItrsquos basically Instagram, said a thrilled Reoch as the laird read from old kitchen diaries.True, Sean and Jen gave Emily Maitlis and Andrew Neil nothing to worry about on the interviewing front, and the production flowed as naturally as treacle uphill, but at least an effort had been made to offer something fresh.Selling Scotlandhad the slickness, but it was  minutes of telly trying to pass as an hourrsquos worth. Much of the territory, including the Tennentrsquos ldquolager lovelies, had been covered before, though it was nice to see the likes of Molly Weir popping into neighboursrsquo houses uninvited to show them how to clean a floor with Flash, and pea and ham from a chicken will always raise a smile.As was pointed out several times, the ads were very much of their time, which apparently made it fine to show sexism and racism that would not have made it through the door any other night.ldquoI canrsquot believe we got away with showing all those ads on the BBC, said Docherty as the show closed. Neither can I, but thatrsquos Hogmanay telly for you a lot of cheek, a bit of charm, and thank Rabbie Burns it is over again for another year."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-100-ways-survive-2020","story":"Count butterflies.Give a pint of blood.Visit a gallery at least once a month.

As we approach the end of this decade , a great deal seems to have changed in political terms, and yet not at all in the way that most of us might have anticipated ten years ago.We were sure that we were in for a tough time of it, economically. The optimistic view was then that the discipline involved in austerity would lead to root and branch reform of the structures of capitalism, tackling monopolistic firms and overhauling the banking system. There was also the expectation that it would offer the opportunity for a rolling back of the state, welfare and pensions reform and a radical reconstruction of the tax system.But almost none of that happened. The banks and the corporatist rent-seekers continue much as before. The reduction in public spending has not been strictly speaking, a reduction in spending, but merely a reduction in the rate of its increase. The tax burden is at a high as is the national debt. The new government ndash a Conservative government, allegedly ndash is aiming to spend even more.The changes, which never transpired, were to be ushered in by a new sort of consensual, centrist politics in the form of the ldquoheir to Blair, David Cameron, and his Liberal Democrat partners. His jibe to Mr Blair, that he ldquowas the future once, looks more pointed now that Mr Cameron himself is history, while his programme of reforms, promises of stability, ldquoa new kind of politics and a ldquoBig Society, are as dead as the Charleston.What was going to be the decade of consensus turned out to be contention and ision on an almost unprecedented scaleyou were looking for historical comparisons you would probably have to pick something like Irish Home Rule or the Corn Laws. What was going to be a transformative politics turned out to be a period of paralysis ndash the apparent paradox is that one reason the political landscape now looks so dferent is that almost nothing could be done while Brexit and independence swept aside the day-to-day issues.The other thing wildly dferent from what might have been assumed ten years ago is where the centre ground in politics actually is. When Mr Cameron and ldquoI agree with Nick Clegg appeared in the garden of Number , we expected government that would be, for the foreseeable future, fiscally conservative and socially liberal.But now that it appears that nobody agrees with Nick, or with his successors in the leadership of the Liberal Democrats, it looks asthe UKrsquos political centre is voters who are fiscally slightly to the centre-left, and socially rather more conservative than metropolitan liberals would like.Contrary to the claims of their opponents, the Conservatives under Boris Johnson have not moved sharply to the right ndash with the exception of their rhetoric on immigration, which, awkwardly for liberals, seems to chime with the general opinion of the voters. In most other regards, the Tories have become steadily more centrist, especially on public spending, while remaining socially liberal on most issues.If it doesnrsquot look like that to some people, itrsquos because the Labour Party has been even more radically transformed into what, to all intents and purposes, seems to be the Bennite wing of the Labour Party in the s. Amazingly, after their catastrophic results in the election, the membership seems inclined to double down on this position, despite the evidence that the only people inclined to vote Labour are their own activists. A membership of around , may be the biggest of any European political party, but itrsquos not an awfully big percentage of the UK electorate.The SNP, unsurprisingly, continues to bang on about independence, which is fair enough, since it is its raison drsquoecirctre. The partyrsquos persistent strength is obviously in part due to their success in converting so many Scots to the cause, but it presents them with problems, too.One is the dficulty of uniting the country on anything  when the subject dominates all discourse another is the practical matter of being the government, and being expected to deliver on domestic policy issues. Long-term electoral success, as Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair discovered, always leads to public disenchantment eventually.We start the new decade with a UK government once more promising real change and improvement. The Whig theory of historymade the assumption that you could explain the present in terms of the past, with the implication that the present was better. Irsquom not sure anyone believes that anymore. On the evidence of the past decade, we should probably just expect the unexpected."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Labour has to learn the language of progressive nationalism if it is to survive","story":"But people rarely vote on their own narrow material interest, rather on what they think is best for the country as a whole.

I would remind Mr Roden that in the days following the  EU referendum, it was the First Minister, mindful of Scotlandrsquos overwhelming vote to remain within the European Union, who travelled to Brussels for talks with EU leaders, carrying with her the mandate from Scottish voters who had elected her on a manesto commitment that there would not be another independence referendum unless there was a ldquosignicant and material change of circumstance, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will. I would further point out to Mr Roden that in the interests of compromise and to lessen the effects of the chaos about to engulf Scotland, Ms Sturgeon offered to take a second independence vote off the tablethe then Prime Minister Theresa May would agree to Scotland remaining within the single market and customs union a request which was denied.Following the result of the General Election, which means that there will not be a second EU referendum and that the UK is definitely leaving the EU, Mr Roden comments that ldquowe will now never know for surethat is what the people really want.

The benches were dumped at the edge of the market in East Princes Street Gardens.They are understood to have cost thousands of pounds and families donate them to the park in memory of loved ones. Christmas market operator Underbelly said they were handled respectfully.The Edinburgh Hotels Association has also said it wants an urgent rethink of how the the city is promoted globally in the wake of the row over the Hogmanay event and the Christmas festival.The Christmas market, which is also run by Underbelly and has taken over an expanded site across Princes Street Gardens for its six-week run, attracting around , visitors a day, has already been the source of controversy this year.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Following the throw from former Doonie player Barrie Reid at pm, the game traveled as close to the Shorie goal as the back of the Kirkwall iCentre before a break involving Mr Baillie#s son Findley Cooper saw the beginning of a slow journey up Great Western Road toward Lidl supermarket and then onto Junction Road.With both teams seeming to get the upper hand at dferent times, it was hard to tell what the outcome would be. However, on this occasion the Uppies weren#t to be resisted and they eventually claimed a very hard-fought win.With the Doonies fighting to the last minute, a mighty throw saw the ba#, made by Edgar Gibson, hit Mackinson#s Corner, and within just a few minutes Mr Baillie emerged from the pack as the winner, to cheers and singing from his team mates.Asked to described how he felt about the win, he replied: #I#m absolutely over the moon.

Andyou go and report something thatrsquos happened to you, yoursquore either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like whatrsquos happened to my daughter may happen, she said.The teenager said she was raped by up to  Israeli tourists in a hotel room in the party town of Ayia Napa on July .But she was charged and the dozen young men, aged between  and , who were arrested over the incident, were freed after she signed a retraction statement  days later.The woman said her daughter is experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder , hallucinations, and is sleeping for up to  hours a day because of a condition called hypersomnia.ldquoShe needs to get back to the UK to get that treated ndash thatrsquos my absolute primary focus. She canrsquot be treated here because hearing foreign men speaking loudly will trigger an episodehellipldquoIt needs resolving otherwise shersquos going to carry on having this for the rest of her le, the woman said.She said her daughter had planned to go to university this year after being accepted for the courses she applied for and being offered a bursary at one institute.ldquoSo, no question, she would have gone to university, but it was in a career that she wouldnrsquot be able to do with this lsquopublic mischiefrsquo verdict, so ndash again, le-changing for her ndash she needs to totally rethink her options.A crowdfunding appeal to raise money for legal support for her daughter has passed pound,. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The GoFundMe page set up by British lawyer John Hobbs--The ldquohelp teen victim get justice in Cyprus GoFundMe page was set up by British lawyer John Hobbs in August to raise cash for the -year-oldrsquos legal representation.A number of prominent legal figures in Cyprus have written to attorney general Costas Clerides urging him to intervene in the case.The group includes former justice minister Kypros Chrysostomides, who told the BBC that the woman involved had ldquoalready suffered a lot and he expected her sentence would be ldquovery lenient.He said: ldquoShe has already been in detention for four-and-a-half weeks and she has been prevented from travelling for about five months already.The teenager claimed in court she was raped but forced to change her account under pressure from Cypriot police.The Foreign Office said the UK was ldquoseriously concerned about the fairness of the womanrsquos trial and it is understood officials have raised the ldquodeeply distressing case with the Cypriot authorities.The teenagerrsquos mother said she would ldquodefinitely like the Foreign Secretary to intervene in the case.She told Radio : ldquoI would love the Foreign Secretary to get involved, that would be fantastic.She said they will be appealing against the verdict ldquowithout question and hoped the FCO could help them progress the case to the Cypriot Supreme Court.She added: ldquoUnfortunately therersquos quite a long waiting list, so our lawyers are looking at what could be done to expedite that.ldquoThatrsquos something maybe the Foreign Office can help us with. -- --Lawyers and campaigners criticised the justice system after she was convicted of public mischief at Famagusta District Court, in Paralimni, on Monday.And the psychologist who assessed the woman as part of her defence case, Dr Christine Tizzard, said she was concerned the trial had not fully considered that she had been diagnosed with PTSD.She told : ldquoThe salient point is that she was diagnosed with PTSD. Thatrsquos a standalone diagnosis. Itrsquos a valid diagnosis and it hasnrsquot really been fully represented.ldquoAside the fact it hasnrsquot been fully represented, it means shersquos been unable to get the treatment she so sorely needs and every day shersquos not having treatment the worse it gets.But the government of Cyprus has said it has ldquofull confidence in the justice system and the courts.Cyprusrsquos attorney general said on Tuesday that he could not suspend the trial because she had levelled ldquograve accusations against police investigators that had to be adjudicated in court.Mr Clerides said the womanrsquos allegation that police coerced her into retracting her rape claim ldquocould not have been left to linger so he could not move to suspend the trial.In a statement, he added: ldquoAny intervention on the part of the attorney general, either for reasons of public interest or any other reasons, would have constituted nothing more than an obstacle to ascertaining the true facts of the case, as well as interference in the judiciaryrsquos work.Judge Michalis Papathanasiou said he believed the woman had made  allegations because she felt ldquoembarrassed after realising she had been filmed having sex in a video found on some of the Israelisrsquo mobile phones.The woman has been on bail since the end of August, after spending a month in prison, and could face up to a year in jail and a , eurofine when she is sentenced on January .Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.The Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias ndash many backed by Iran ndash called on their supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying ldquoyour message has been received.By late afternoon, the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies.-- vw,vw,px, px\"A man waves the Iraqi flag while Iraqi army soldiers are deployed in front of the embassy--US Apache helicopters circled overhead.ldquoAfter achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly, said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. ldquoWe rubbed Americarsquos nose in the dirt.Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the US air strikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.ldquoWe donrsquot care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines, said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. ldquoOn the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from, he said, before withdrawing from the area.The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy US sanctions have cratered Iranrsquos economy. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Pro-Iranian militiamen and their supporters drive away from the US embassy in Baghdad--Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fuelled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iranrsquos heavy influence over the countryrsquos affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.US President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy and the Pentagon dispatched an infantry battalion of about  soldiers to the Middle East. A US official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait.Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that ldquo the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.Iran later summoned the Swiss charge drsquoaffaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest over what it said was warmongering by US officials.Tensions have steadily risen since Mr Trump withdrew the US from Iranrsquos  nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Iraqi soldiers stand guard in front of the embassy--Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.US officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.The US has sent more than , additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the US had about , troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.The US and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the  US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraqrsquos Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.Iran helped to mobilise tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle so-called Islamic State when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in  as the armed forces collapsed.-- vw,vw,px, px\"An Iraqi soldier stands guard in front of smoke rising from a fire set by pro-Iranian militiamen and their supporters--The US and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December .The political influence of the Popular Mobilisation Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone.

Directed by Jezza Neumann, it allowed a handful of children to give first-hand accounts of le on the financial margins.The fact those featured were so young stripped their commentary of artice. They talked in matter-of-fact tones of hardships that would have broken many adults. Courtney, eight, who lives in Cambridge – “the most unequal city in the UK” – counted out coppers in the hope there would be enough for heating, before resigning herself to another night spent sleeping in her coat. Cameron, a pale and undernourished boy, described eking out diminishing food supplies. “We try not to eat a lot in one day, even though most of us are really hungry,” he said.Growing Up Poor painted a picture of the UK that made A Christmas Carol, with all its paternalism, feel entirely contemporary a world where the working poor are forced to survive on charity hand-outs.It was jam-packed with heroes. There was Danielle, who tried to carve out a bit of space in temporary accommodation to study for her GCSEs, and Courtney’s mother, who drew a chart to try to explain her depression to her daughter. Then there were those who donated to and ran the food banks, and Neumann himself, who avoided all the pitfalls of poverty porn to bring us this thoughtful piece of film-making. The villains – the architects of the Westminster government’s austerity programme – were less visible, but ever-present, behind the scenes, undermining the foundations that used to keep the lives of the underprivileged stable. Iain Duncan Smith’s welfare reforms were the dark heart of Growing Up Poor. Whatever his original intention, those reforms and the striver skiver rhetoric they produced were responsible for pushing just-coping families into destitution .And yet Duncan Smith is among those being rewarded in the New Year’s Honours list. Much to the horror of anti-poverty campaigners, the man behind Universal Credit, the bedroom tax and the two-child cap – three of the most odious policies of the decade – is being knighted because ofthe havoc he wreaked. That’s the way it goes nowadays. Those who sow chaos and confusion are gloried, while those left to pick up the pieces of their own and other people’s lives remain in the shadows. The likes of Duncan Smith lack the insight to be embarrassed by such unseemly boys’ club back-slapping. He will doubtless regard himself as a fitting recipient of the title Sir – asUniversal Credit had fulfilled its mission of helping millions back into work rather than entrenching misery and social exclusion.It was, famously, in Easterhouse, that Duncan Smith experienced an epiphany. Back in , he wept in the face of condemned tenements and boarded up lives. This moment of empathy inspired him to evangelise about “compassionate Conservatism”. Under his leadership, he pledged, the Tories would become “the natural party of those who want to make a better le for themselves and their children”.How hollow that sounds now. Yet, with hindsight, that phrase foreshadowed everything that would go wrong with his welfare reforms. It hinted at that most Dickensian of binaries: the deserving and the undeserving poor. It made a spurious distinction between “those who want to make a better le for themselves” and those considered too feckless to care.There are groups, including the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, who believe Universal Credit was a good idea in principle. It was aimed at simplying an over-complicated system by rolling six benefits into one, and – more importantly – at incentivising people to work.The logic was, on the face of it, unimpeachable. The way the benefits system was structured meant those who moved from claiming, say, Jobs Seekers Allowance, to low-paid employment would often find themselves losing out financially, which cannot be right.But with this logic came other shakier assumptions: that everyone ought to be entering the labour market that no-one would ever be too ill to work or have other competing pressures on their time, such as caring for children, the elderly or the disabled.And so a new era was indeed ushered in: an era of sanctions and Atos fitness-for-work tests, which saw benefit claimants penalised for attending funerals and the chronically ill forced to prove they had not staged some miraculous recovery. It was the era of being punished for having an extra bedroom – evenyour own child slept in it every other weekend. It was the era of growing mental health dficulties and soaring suicides. The era of I, Daniel Blake.Universal Credit caused more problems than it solved,it solved any. It was supposed to help people into work. But in , the Institute for Fiscal Studies claimed some groups, such as single parents, had less of an incentive to work under Universal Credit than the old system and that . million working families faced an average loss of £, a year.The five-week hiatus before Universal Credit was received meant claimants like Courtney’s mother had no money to feed their children. They were forced to go to food banks or to take out loans they had no hope of repaying.By the time the National Audit Office issued its scathing report in , Duncan Smith was gone. He resigned over cuts to disability benefits in , and four more work and pensions secretaries followed in quick succession. But the conceptual and logistical flaws the NAO report identied were ones that originated under his watch. Head of the organisation, Amyas Morse, said the case for Universal Credit was based on unproven assumptions. “We think the larger claims for universal credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future,” he said.Nor has the situation improved over the last  months. Last month, the UN rapporteur for extreme poverty, Philip Alston, said the UK government’s austerity policies were driven by “a political desire for social engineering” and that key elements of the post war social contract devised by William Beveridge had been swept away.Alston also insisted the UK government was in a state of denial about reports suggesting  million people, a fth of the population, now live in poverty, with . million destitute.It is in the same spirit of denial, no doubt, that Duncan Smith was offered and accepted his knighthood. His elevation further undermines an already discredited honours system. \u2028But it is entirely in tune with today’s politics: cruelty and incompetence rewarded by a self-promoting clique, while those working long hours to improve people’s lives might as well be invisible.As the MP for Chingford and Woodford Green kneels on the red carpet at Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, what will Courtney be doing  Or Cameron  Or Danielle  They will be struggling on, supporting their parents through the worst of their misery. Unfortunately, there are no knighthoods for stoicism. Or resilience. Or making the best of things.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

That shouldn’t mean a negative focus on EU citizens living here, but as British and European leaders arm-wrestle their way through the year ahead, producing us versus them narratives and “Hop off you frogs” headlines aplenty, it probably will. In  a new Labour leader will probably officially embrace Brexit and leave millions of Remain voters south of the Border without any means of democratic expression, thanks also to the collapse of the bickering People’s Vote campaign and the leaderless Lib Dems. Anyone hoping the main Westminster opposition parties will swtly recover from the failed Brexit battles of yesteryear to refocus on the human rights battles of tomorrow is likely to be disappointed.The enlarged cohort of SNP MPs has the energy, mandate and moral authority to champion the views of the “losing” side, raise important questions about the way Brexit is managed and persuade gung-ho Leave voters that giving Boris carte blanche over every aspect of British le is not a good idea. But the third largest party at Westminster is customarily ignored by politicians and the mainstream media. There’s no reason to think  will be any dferent.South of the Border at least, Europeanism has suddenly become as unfashionable and last season as glittery cards, wrapping paper, carols and Brussels sprouts – a Christmas tradition which could, incidentally, disappearrivals follow the example set this Christmas by Morrisons and Asda and rebadge their sprouts with local origins. Soon, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Scottish sprouts will be all we’ve ever known.A small thing perhaps and both supermarkets insist that pleasing Brexiters played no part in their re-labelling decisions. But maybe a sign of things to come. A sign that anything or anyone from a European country will soon smack of an alien culture. Is this overstating things  The statistics suggest not.The number of hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales has more than doubled from , in - to a new record of , in  while the number of cases passed to prosecutors has dropped from  to just  per cent. Admittedly, referral rates have dropped across all types of offence, hate crimes sometimes don’t have named suspects, and out-of-court disposals don’t result in criminal charges. Suspects are also harder to identy when anonymous accounts are used to send abuse and threats online. But still, as weekend stabbings in a rabbi’s home north of New York City amply testy, attacks on minorities can happen in apparently tolerant environments. And Britain is not likely to be all that tolerant a place in . If EU leaders take a tough stance during forthcoming trade talks – as they surely must – the hostile and triumphalist Europhobic British press will have a field day, demonising EU institutions and painting European leaders as robbers and thugs determined to cheat the noble, freedom-seeking Brits. In this unpleasant and toxic political environment, unsuspecting, ordinary EU citizens will be on the receiving end of anti-Brussels sentiment. Indeed, that nasty process has already started, in some very surprising locations.A few customers at the Ceilidh Place Hotel and restaurant in Ullapool objected to a tiny EU flag mounted over the cash-desk. Days later, a French waiter was effectively told to get back home by a guest. Now all waiting staff wear T-shirts sporting the -stars of the EU flag on their backs, in solidarity with their French colleague and anyone  picked on for their ethnicity. Thanks to the hotel owners’ strong public stance, there’s been open discussion about changing public behaviour and some visitors have revealed bruising encounters they’ve experienced where. One Portuguese man living here for almost a decade, said customers now regularly demand to be served by “someone who speaks English properly,” at his workplace – a large High Street department store in Scotland. His English is almost perfect. A workmate also told him to stop using his native tongue while chatting with two other Portuguese speakers in the staff canteen. Are these incidents unusual one-offs or the tip of an iceberg set to grow larger as Britain’s acrimonious withdrawal from the EU dominates front pages and political discourse in   How will employers and managers respond Scotland prides itself on welcoming New Scots and Nicola Sturgeon was widely praised for reaching out to EU citizens straight after the  referendum, reassuring all who’d chosen to live and work here that Scotland was their home. This message of international solidarity gets loud cheers at independence rallies – partly because it neatly distinguishes Scots from very dferent English attitudes towards immigration, Europe and international cooperation. But are we just virtue-signalling and kidding ourselves  Are EU citizens getting almost as many pointed and unpleasant jibes in Remain-voting Scotland as Brexit-voting England  It’s impossible to know for sure. But these and other incidents should prompt the SNP to try and reconfigure the Westminster debate before Britain withdraws on  January. Otherwise, a very nasty scenario could develop – one in which EU nationals are singled out, pilloried and turned into scapegoats for the political and economic uncertainty that will inevitably arise as a wildly over-promising Conservative leader hits the brick wall of an unyielding and united bloc of EU trade negotiators. Agreed – the notion that Britain might somehow remain in the EU or single market, through the mechanism of a second vote, or a Remain alliance at Westminster is now officially dead, but the idea of a part-European identity and the internationalising impact of freedom of movement has always meant more to Scots Remain voters than the arcane details of tarf-free trade, and harmonised regulations. It still does. Protecting the rights of EU citizens living amongst us is an expression of enlightened self-interest, curiosity about other cultures, gratitude for the energy and enthusiasm of incomers and recognition of the enduring importance of respecting cultural and ethnic dference. Boris Johnson’s self-imposed December trade negotiations deadline is bound to ramp up anti-European, anti-foreigner rhetoric.If Scotland wants to remain a proud “mongrel nation”, we must hold the line against any descent into foreigner-blaming.

We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Heartbroken son’s emotional tribute to his road victim father...his ‘rock’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"TYRO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"new ulster hockey kirk cup sponsorship deal to help raise funds for ni children s hospice","story":"Ahead of the final, NI Law Firm of the Year, Millar McCall Wylie, has announced a sponsorship deal with Ulster Hockey to back the competition through to the end of .Chief Operating Officer, Christopher McCandless said: ldquoWe are thrilled to be sponsoring the Kirk Cup, both this season and next.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna. Mum was probably my biggest supporter and I want to do her, my we and children proud. I want to show my kids that there is nothing you can’t achieve through hard work and doing your best.”Sinn Féin group leader on the Council, Ciarán Beattie, described Mr Baker as a “well-respected and grounded community activist in the Colin area”.He added: “He has also been a vocal campaigner for LGBT and Irish language rights, climate action, community empowerment and for mental health awareness. “Danny will take this grassroot style of representation into the role of Mayor and ensure that all the needs of the citizens of this city are reflected in Belfast City Council. I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane. He placed human rights social justice, environmentalism and defending Belfast against Brexit at the heart of his term.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"health workers begin 12 hour","story":"THOUSANDS of health workers across the north have begun -hour strike action in a dispute over pay and patient safety.The Royal College of Nursing, who represent around , nurses, are taking strike action for the first time in its -year history.About , other nurses, who are members of Unison have also walked out.On Tuesday night, leaders of the five main parties met the head of the NI Civil Service, David Sterling, and Health Department Permanent Secretary, Richard Pengelly, in a th-hour bid to avert the strike action and state their “collective support for the restoration of pay parity”.The Northern Ireland Office later said that Health was a devolved matter and Mr Sterling rejected the idea of restoring pay parity on the grounds of public interest.UNISON Regional Secretary Patricia McKeown said: “Everyone with power and authority in this society has conceded that our cause is just. We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"dup mp opposes call to ban hunting with dogs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

intelligence-gathering role is to spot iniduals who act suspiciously when they see police nearby, perhaps by attempting to hide or make off at pace in the other direction.Servator, Latin for “watcher”, was trialled by the PSNI throughout , including during the Open Championship golf tournament at Portrush in July and a six-week deployment in Belfast city centre in the lead-up to Christmas.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Servator officers search an inidual in Belfast city centre in the run up to Christmas The Servator team was on the ground  times in Belfast from November

and dealt with more than  other iniduals by other means, such as by issuing advice or engaging in conversation.Several drugs seizures were made as a result of the deployments and the arrests included

to avoid police,” she said.“So it’s about providing that police presence but with the plain-clothed officers working alongside and what that would look like on the ground is that the plain-clothed officers would see these tell-tale signs, inform their unormed colleagues, and then we would exercise our stop and search powers and conduct a stop and search.”Ms Foy said the feedback from the public and business community had been “very positive”.“Over the course of the six weeks the team visited the Christmas markets, shops, cafes and licensed premises to offer reassurance and advice on keeping staff and customers safe,” she said.“Officers engaged with council workers, post workers, security staff, street performers and members of the public who all played an important role in helping us keep people safe by being our eyes and ears and reporting suspicious activity and we’re grateful for their support.”It is anticipated that the dedicated Servator team will conduct patrols in towns and

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

NEW YEAR, NEW BEGINNING!”In a subsequent New Year’s Day video posted by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar outlining his government’s priorities for , Mr Coveney added: “We are determined to work with all of the parties in Northern Ireland to get the devolved government back up and running again, to get the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement ing again, to bring communities together and to ensure that Northern Ireland can make decisions for itself.”The latest push to restore powersharing broke up the week before Christmas, with UK and Irish governments singling out the DUP as the party standing in the way of a deal.The party rejected the claims, insisting it would not be “bounced” into a “quick fix” that falls apart when tested.Devolution can only be restored once the DUP and Sinn Fein – the region’s two largest parties – agree terms to re-enter a mandatory coalition executive in Belfast.The other three main parties – the SDLP, Ulster Unionists and Alliance – are also involved in the talks process convened by the UK and Irish governments.While they could take positions in any new executive, their sign-off on a deal is not essential and a government could be formed in their absence, with those parties having the option of going into opposition.Quiet road, on way back to #Belfast early morning for talks to get #Stormont working again.  can be a new beginning for politics in NI with leadership  generosity from all sides - we’ve got less than  weeks - let’s not disappoint again! NEW YEAR, NEW BEGINNING! pic FlYzoJXW— Simon CoveneyJanuary , Expectations of a breakthrough in the three-year powersharing impasse rose after the general election.The DUP and Sinn Fein both suffered bruising results, with many interpreting the outcome as the public passing judgment on their failure to do a deal and providing a fresh incentive to do business.However, proposals to reform a contentious cross-community voting mechanism in the Assembly have emerged as a key sticking point in efforts to finalise an agreement, with the DUP unhappy about what is being countenanced.The DUP is also seeking changes to ensure the devolved institutions are more stable in future and cannot be readily pulled down.Proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers are another crucial element of the negotiations.The Stormont parties are also seeking a firm commitment from the UK government on a financial package to accompany theof devolution – money that would likely be targeted at the region’s crisis-hit health service.The leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein used their respective New Year messages to restate a desire toto government.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  DUP leader Arlene Foster has insisted her party is up for a “fair and balanced deal” DUP leader Arlene Foster said it must be a decade of “decision rather than dithering”.“The talks will recommence on Thursday,” she said.“We will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal.  A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no-one feels their culture is being marginalised.”While Ms Foster warned that a focus on a potential border poll would lead to a “wasted decade”, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald insisted a united Ireland was within reach.But the republican leader added: “There is no contradiction in working for Irish unity and working for the restoration of the Executive and Assembly – they are all part of the Good Friday Agreement.“We have spent three years searching for agreement to re-establish the north’s institutions and we got there in February , but the DUP walked away from that deal. We cannot have that scenario again – the choice is now for agreement, or elections, but the current situation cannot continue.“It is in the interests of all our people that we establish good government and real power-sharing based on equality and respect.“The outstanding issues can be resolved. The time for acrimony and ision is over. The time for slogans and soundbites is over. The test now for every party that has talked up getting back to work is to go back to the Executive table and deliver.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mary Lou McDonald says the time for “slogans and soundbites is over” Stormont imploded three years ago this month when the late Sinn Fein deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest at the DUP’s handling of a botched green energy scheme.That dispute soon widened to encompass traditional rts over issues such as the Irish language and the toxic legacy of the Troubles.A logjam over proposals to reform the petition of concern voting mechanism was one of the main reasons a deal failed to materialise before Christmas.It was designed to protect minority rights but politicians have accused each other of misusing it for their own ends.Discussions around change surround making it more dficult for one party to use the petition to block controversial legislation.The parties are also considering amending Assembly rules to make it harder to collapse the institutions."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/4f016/38822178.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/e%20Teenage%20victims.jpg","title":"the headlines of 2019 a year of roller coaster highs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.The Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias – many backed by Iran – called on their supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying “your message has been received”.By late afternoon, the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A man waves the Iraqi flag while Iraqi army soldiers are deployed in front of the embassy US Apache helicopters circled overhead.“After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,” said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. “We rubbed America’s nose in the dirt.”Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the US air strikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.“We don’t care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines,” said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. “On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,” he said, before withdrawing from the area.The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy US sanctions have cratered Iran’s economy.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Pro-Iranian militiamen and their supporters drive away from the US embassy in Baghdad Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fuelled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran’s heavy influence over the country’s affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.US President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy and the Pentagon dispatched an infantry battalion of about  soldiers to the Middle East. A US official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait.Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that “ the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly”.Iran later summoned the Swiss charge d’affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest over what it said was warmongering by US officials.Tensions have steadily risen since Mr Trump withdrew the US from Iran’s  nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Iraqi soldiers stand guard in front of the embassy Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.US officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.The US has sent more than , additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the US had about , troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.The US and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the  US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq’s Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.Iran helped to mobilise tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle so-called Islamic State when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in  as the armed forces collapsed. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  An Iraqi soldier stands guard in front of smoke rising from a fire set by pro-Iranian militiamen and their supporters The US and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December .The political influence of the Popular Mobilisation Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with littleany resistance from authorities.Iraq’s government vehemently condemned the air strikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of erting attention from the anti-government protests.“Iran has been trying to provoke the US into helping it solve its Iraq problem,” the Crisis Group, an international think tank, said in a briefing on the crisis. “The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and where with air strikes, has obliged.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ts eliots letters to muse to be unveiled after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It’s momentous to have these letters coming outAnthony Cuda, TS Eliot International Summer School“I think it’s perhaps the literary event of the decade,” said Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the TS Eliot International Summer School.“I don’t know of anything more awaited or signicant. It’s momentous to have these letters coming out.”Hale and Eliot were lelong friends who exchanged letters for about  years, beginning in .The pair met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in  but did not rekindle their friendship until .Eliot was already living in England and Hale taught drama at US universities, including Scripps College in Calornia.In , Hale donated the letters under an agreement that they would not be opened until  years after either her or Eliot’s death, whichever came second.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal.

All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows.

Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband.

Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money.

It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done.

She played everywhere and set up her own label. If you didn’t make it to one of her shows in the last twelve months I strongly recommend you change your ways in the coming twelve.Oisin O’Scolai became an employee of the Empire in Belfast and a minion of R G Shiels’ Black Trajik label and released “Vacant Sea” Conor McAteer released the beautul “North” under the pen name We Are Aerials, at the time of writing there is no proof that he is actually an aerial but plenty that he is a complete….Maya Goldblum lived here, played here, released “Light Shadow Boom Boom” played more then left. Sandpoint, Idaho’s regain is our loss. googletag.cmd.push  The late Eamon Frielenjoying a joke with fellow Derry musician Paddy Nash. As part of Record Store Day celebrations Glen Hansard played St Columb’s Hall twice and we learned two things, Cool Discs is the compos mentis brain of the sceneand that Derry crowds are absolutely terrible people. Like McAteer. Red Organ Serpent Sound came back to headline the magic Tuned In Project’s fundraiser show. They then released their second album’s demos. They haven’t released their first album yet but I’m assured it’s on its way.We proved ourselves more than capable of putting ourselves on the map via the Celtronic, Feile, Together, Stendhal, Oscillations and Modulations festivals, not to mention the fundraiser gigs for NICU and the Tuned In Project, great times and great music were had by all. googletag.cmd.push Damien Dempsey came back to Derry for the anniversary of the Civil Rights movement’s most important work.The music and performing arts course in the tech headed up by Rory Donaghy and Grainne McNamaragave itself the credit it deserves and is now living under the new identity MAPA and being rightfully celebrated for training up the musicians and tech-heads that keep our funny wee engine running. Marty Coyle went to Bulgaria as a musician in residence and came back with whole new bag of ingredients for future Balkan Derry work. You were probably in Tinney’s watching them last night and no doubt agree wholeheartedly.Janet Hoy and a group of other artists created “The Stone Tapes” which were sonic representations of the Walls of Derry, the memories trapped in stone can be heard at www.stonetapes. The Clameens played their first live show since disbanding without Doyle at Lisahally in August and promised us nothing really. They came, they saw, they conquered and they’ll let us know the craic sure.The Clameens have sadly aged and now the young punks have taken over. No Collusion are leading the way for independent, frenetic noise and keeping the spirit of Bam Bam  The Calling well and truly alive. Between them, Fast Thursday and Happy Out the punk scene is well and truly flourishing. Rebecca Harkin released “Things Man Be Someway” and Great White Lies released “Chrysalis” and both proved that jazz isn’t as terrible as I thought and, more importantly, the young musicians of Doire and Donegal know a million times more about music than the frequenters of the start of may party.  The late Micky Grfiths who is sadly missed.Keith Harkin continued to soar around America but landed back in Ireland to build and promote his Barn Studios and work with White Denim and The Eagles collaborators. Contact the Barn Studios on Facebook, it’s an absolute treat and the rates are magic.The year belonged to Quiet Arch and the work of Eoin O’Callaghan and Ryan Vail on their “Borders” album. Everything about it came from here, from writing and making, to promoting and videoing. A true triumph of independence that will live forever. It won the album of the year at the NI Music prize and their stablemates Cherym picked up the Oh Yeah Contender award. Sadly this year we lost Eamon Friel in June and his loss is reverberates still, a truly loved, inspiring and cherished foundation of everything musical in Derry left the kind of memories that will outlast us all. Then, in December, Micky Grfiths passed away. Joe Brown said he stopped him from going sane. I can’t think of a more beautul tribute. I genuinely hope that everyone has someone in their le like Micky. There’s loads to come in the New Year but I’ll get to that later.

The scheme, which will extend for a distance of approximately . kilometres from its junction with the A Tobermore Road to Nutgrove Road, will greatly improve the strength and surface quality of this section of the road network. The carriageway works on the Draperstown Road, Desertmartin will commence on Monday, January  .Given the nature of the scheme and to help ensure the safety of road users and workers, it will be necessary to implement a full road closure for the duration of the works. googletag.cmd.push During the road closure a two-way traffic ersion will be in operation along the A Tobermore Road from Desertmartin to Tobermore and the B Draperstown Road from Tobermore to Draperstown. The Nutgrove Road Tobermore Road junction will also be closed to all traffic. Residents and landowners living along Nutgrove Road should use the Iniscarn Road to access the A Tobermore Road and B Draperstown Road during the duration of this closure. Advanced warning signage for the closure will be provided and ersion routes will be signed as necessary. Local access will be facilitated.Completion of the scheme by Sunday, January  is subject to favourable weather conditions and the Department will keep the public informed of any change. googletag.cmd.push The Department has carefully programmed the works operations and traffic management arrangements in order to minimise any inconvenience to the public, however road users should expect some delays and should allow additional time when planning any journeys. The work was welcomed last week by Sinn Fein councillor Catherine Elattar who has campaigned for the much needed work. She said: At this stage, the work being done will only go as far as the Nutgrove Road, but I am hopeful that as soon as funds become available that the work will be continued along the road to Draperstown. This whole stretch of road needs to be done and we will continue to lobby for this to happen as soon as possible.For traffic information about this and other improvement schemes visit: www.trafficwatchni  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

By now, no-one in Northern Ireland, or indeed the rest of the UK, can be in any doubt about the inequalities in health care that people in Northern Ireland are facing.

We are also disappointed to hear that attempts to negotiate an agreement leading to the restoration of the devolved institutions has failed. “Although we wish to see political leadership and accountability in Northern Ireland restored, nurses deeply resent the link that is being made between this and resolving the crisis in health care. Sorting out this crisis is a priority regardless of our political situation, which has been in disarray for the past three years. We do not have another three years to wait. googletag.cmd.push “We wonder how much longer this inaction can continue before somebody, somewhere, can take a decision to recty the problems we are facing ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year. It is currently a mere poundm which is totally inadequate and falls well short of what the public expect, declared Mr McGrath.ldquoApparently, there are only eight full time staff managing the work of replacing and fixing street lights across the whole of North and this is wholly unacceptable. Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening.

Like many other couples of that era, the wedding was a small affair and they spent a welcome few days honeymooning in Dublin.Alan worked as a writer in the Supply and Secretariat branch of the Royal Navy and soon needed to leave his new bride at home toto his posting. Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

In the end, it just wasnrsquot to be. I have been around a long time and just have to accept that that is democracy and politics can be cruel at times, but I enjoyed every minute of it.Mr Savage added: ldquoA lot of people wrote us off in  and said the SDLP was finished. We have a lot of very good, talented young people coming through and, as far as I am concerned, we have a bright future ahead of us. I think what our results have shown tonight is that people have realised that stalemate politics and power splitting, rather than power-sharing, is not working for the people of Northern Ireland.The DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna, who saw his party vote decrease by just over two per cent mdash down from , in  to , mdash said he was pleased the DUP remained ldquothe voice of unionism in South Down on what had been a disappointing night for his party where, particularly in North and South Belfast.He said that the election count had been a ldquotough night for unionism explaining that he was not disappointed with his own performance in an ldquounforeseen election.Mr Hanna added: ldquoIt is important that the DUP remains the voice of unionism in South Down and it is going to stay that way as we have a solid voice and a firm Assembly seat. On the doorstep, people said they wanted the Assembly up and running and I think that that is going to happen.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was delighted to increase the partyrsquos vote by over  per cent.In  the party polled , votes which Brown increase to , votes last week, placing Alliance fourth in the South Down pecking order, just  votes behind the DUP.The Alliance man believes that the only way to unite people in South Down is toa cross-community candidate to Westminster, suggesting that the surge in support for his party was because people are ldquofed up with the current situation at Stormont.Brown also believes that Alliance is potentially edging towards a South Down Assembly seat given the strong constituency base that it now has and that he would be up for contesting any future election.Ulster Unionist Jill Macauley mdash who was delighted to increase the party vote by just over three percent mdash rising from , votes two years ago to , this time out, was one of bright lights of her partyrsquos Westminster campaign.She was delighted to increase the vote at what she described as ldquoturbulent political times and said it was clear on the doorstep that voters are angry with the conduct of the DUP and Sinn Fein and their lack of delivery.ldquoThe clear message from the electorate was that they want local politicians to get back to work and restore the Assembly and the Executive. The current health crisis was also a major concern and the impending emergency that faces our strangled education system, she said.ldquoWith the UUP share of the vote increasing in such a toxic environment, it encourages me that we must be doing something right. I hope voters will continue to put their faith in the Ulster Unionist Party as a vehicle in which unionism can move forward as an inclusive and modern movement, instead of the politics of fear we have all come to know.Aontuacute, which was contesting its first Westminster election, polled , votes,  less than the collective performance of its three candidates at the recent Newry, Mourne and Down Council election..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Im.jpg","title":"I’m here to serve you%2C says Shannon  ","story":"STRANGFORD MP Jim Shannon secured another convincing victory mdash albeit with a reduced vote mdash for the third time in last weekrsquos general election.The overall Strangford turnout vote was also down, just .% of the eligible electorate compared to .% turnout in .While Mr Shannon topped the poll with , votes out of , valid votes, it was a %on his last thumping win when he was the DUP MP with the biggest majority.This year that honour went to Ian Paisley in North Antrim, who was nearly , votes clear of his nearest rival.A committed Christian and a pro-le advocate, Mr Shannon appealed to nearly half of the Strangford voters, earning a . % share of the vote in what was always a one-horse race.However, as he and his election team stood while Stephen Farryrsquos North Down win for Alliance was announced at Bangorrsquos Aurora Centre around am on Friday morning, there was an air of sombreness and distinct lack of celebration mdash perhaps due to news which had filtered through that party colleagues Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly were in danger of losing their seats.The ing officer seemed to be in a rush to make the Strangford announcement as Dr Farry was unable to make his acceptance speech until after Mr Shannonrsquos victory was announced.Mr Shannonrsquos  year-old mother, Mona, who lives near Kircubbin, was there to support him, as was his we, Sandra.

As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for.

I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult.

NEW YEAR, NEW BEGINNING!”The leaders of the DUP and Sinn Fein used their respective New Year messages to restate a desire toto government.DUP leader Arlene Foster said it must be a decade of “decision rather than dithering”.“The talks will recommence on Thursday,” she said.“We will be there and stand ready to restore devolution through a fair and balanced deal. A Northern Ireland that is going to keeping moving forward must be one where everyone feels at home but must also be one where no-one feels their culture is being marginalised.”While Ms Foster warned that a focus on a potential border poll would lead to a “wasted decade”, Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald insisted a united Ireland was within reach.Someone will get killed - enough is enough say

He said: “The Prime Minister’s speech was heard in respectful silence but the Taoiseach’s speech was marred by some ill-mannered sighs, groans and chattering from unionist delegrations which degenerated at the end into actual interruptions.”Unionists objected to the proceedings being jointly chaired by the British and Irish governments, with an eventual acceptance by Dublin that the secretary of state would act as interim chairman until a decision on a permanent chair.“The SDLP were in grim mood and determined to press for George Mitchell for chairman on the basis of an unchanged agenda and procedural guidelines.”The DUP and UKUP were strongly opposed to Mitchell on two grounds. First, they did not agree with the role he would enjoy and the powers that went with it.“Second, and more crucial in their view, was the fact that he was fatally compromised in unionist eyes because of his background and the way that his appointment had been acclaimed by the Irish government and Sinn Fein.“At this stage the mood of McCartney and Paisley was friendly, jolly and courteous, a condition which did not last.“The UUP had objections to Mitchell which were similar, but in their case the powers and procedures that he would operate under were much more prevalent than their reservations about his backgrounds, which had, to a large extent, been assuaged by personal contact between Mitchell and Trimble.“Their attitude and position was also complicated by all too obvious concerns about being outflanked by Paisley and stirrings within their own party.“Pulling in another direction, however, was Trimble’s evident huge enjoyment about being involved in negotiations which, I believe, contributed to a strong personal reluctance to walk away.Declassied Files: Labour planned to put NI on an involuntary path to Irish unity Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The Alliance were in deepest gloom. They had been very depressed, though perhaps not surprised, by the procedural wrangling which had, so far, totally dominated events.”Mr Howard said that the Irish government “acquiesced in the subordinate role they played” in the meetings, “though they evidently did not like it”.He said that towards the end of the day “it became clear thatwe were to keep the UUP in the process it would be necessary to address their concern about the procedural rules.” It was accepted that a deal which brought in the UUP would probably not be enough to retain the DUP and UKUP but the judgment of both governments and the independent chairmen was that in such circumstances the talks would remain viable.”The following day the governments tabled proposals for amended procedures and the parties then entered bilateral negotiations with each other, the governments and the chairmen.“After a huge row with the Irish government, the SDLP very reluctantly accepted that this was the best on offer. The DUP and the UKUP effectively rejected it ... in the end and as expected, it came down to trying to do a deal with the UUP.“Their initial reaction to the paper was that it had some good elements in it but the order needed to be changed [appointing a committee first to finalise the rules before appointing a plenary chairman].“However, the Secretary of State said he intended to press ahead with the proposal as it had been tabled.“Trimble at that stage said that this was unacceptable. The Secretary of State said that ... in those circumstances [he] would have little option but to conclude that the talks were not viable [and] suspend them.“A consequence of that, of course, would be that there would be no Forum. This evinced some horried looks, particularly from Geoffrey [sic] Donaldson and a physical mental gulp from Trimble who, nevertheless, said ‘So be it’.“By pm, he said that the Secretary of State had concluded that it was ‘the end of the process’ and “we reported to the Prime Minister suggesting that the only card remaining was a direct call from him to Trimble.“Events then took an extraordinary turn. Very shortly after his meeting with the Secretary of State, Trimble asked to see Senator Mitchell and at . presented a compromise proposal to the Secretary of State, saying that he would be prepared to accept Mitchell as chairman, provided that the interim rules under which he operated were not those of  June, but those which applied during the   talks.“The Secretary of State believed that this was a major concession and the next few hours were spent trying desperately to sell it to the Irish Government and the SDLP.“For a while this showed signs of being fruitless with Hume effectively saying that he and his party had already moved enough in the direction of unionist concerns and would move no further and the Irish showing an overwhelming and inexplicable solitude for the dignity of the three independent chairman [sic], effectively suggesting that it would be best for everyonewe were to cut our losses and move out of the process.” However, he said that “then news filtered up about another almost unprecedented event in the shape of direct negotiations between Irish ministersand David Trimble. .”He said that for several hours that left the British side “in the unaccustomed position of having to twiddle its thumbs while the Irish and the UUP tried to come to terms”.That ended when the tanaiste appeared “clutching a piece of paper... representing an agreement between the Irish, the UUP and the SDLP”.By now it was almost midnight and “Dr Paisley and his colleagues became increasingly loud and belligerent, at one time threatening to burst into the Secretary of State’s office”.When informed that a deal had been done, there were “loud shouts of protests and Paisley, McCartney and their teams stormed out”.Eventually, after midnight, Senator Mitchell took over as chairman and faced a barrage from Dr Paisley who then led the DUP out.Martin Howard said: “In  months as a private secretary I have been privileged to be part of, or witness to, a number of extraordinary events, but I think the last two days has topped them all.“More than once, the whole enterprise was on the point of failure and, in accordance with normal practice in Northern Irish political affairs, was only saved in the small hours of the morning ... most extraordinary of all was the fact that the final deal was done between the Irish government and David Trimble.”He added: “Finally, the other great success has been leaving Sinn Fein literally, and metaphorically, out in the cold. Their attempt to gain entry into the talks on Monday failed to gain them the public confrontation which they had sought and their demonstrations on Tuesday and Wednesday attracted minimal media coverage.”try catch  TrendingGame of Thrones NI actor Andrew Dunbar dies suddenlyThe full list of the  Northern Ireland New Yearrsquos Honours recipientsPSNI issue  warning after receiving highly

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.The Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias ndash many backed by Iran ndash called on their supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying ldquoyour message has been received.By late afternoon, the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies.  -- vw,vw,px, px\"A man waves the Iraqi flag while Iraqi army soldiers are deployed in front of the embassy  --US Apache helicopters circled overhead.ldquoAfter achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly, said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. ldquoWe rubbed Americarsquos nose in the dirt.Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the US air strikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.ldquoWe donrsquot care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines, said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. ldquoOn the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from, he said, before withdrawing from the area.The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy US sanctions have cratered Iranrsquos economy. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Pro-Iranian militiamen and their supporters drive away from the US embassy in Baghdad  --Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fuelled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iranrsquos heavy influence over the countryrsquos affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.US President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy and the Pentagon dispatched an infantry battalion of about  soldiers to the Middle East. A US official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait.Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that ldquo the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.Iran later summoned the Swiss charge drsquoaffaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest over what it said was warmongering by US officials.Tensions have steadily risen since Mr Trump withdrew the US from Iranrsquos  nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Iraqi soldiers stand guard in front of the embassy  --Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.US officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.The US has sent more than , additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the US had about , troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.The US and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the  US-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.

That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with littleany resistance from authorities.Iraqrsquos government vehemently condemned the air strikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of erting attention from the anti-government protests.ldquoIran has been trying to provoke the US into helping it solve its Iraq problem, the Crisis Group, an international think tank, said in a briefing on the crisis. ldquoThe Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and where with air strikes, has obliged..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Militiamen withdraw from US embassy in Iraq article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
