First Man begins in 1961 as the US trails the Soviet Union in the space race and takes viewers up to the Moon landing in 1969.

From my interviews with his family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite. And we wanted the film to reflect Neil.\u0027Gosling also joked that he may be biased because he is Canadian. Chazelle is French-Canadian.The decision to place a US flag on the Moon was controversial at the time with debates over whether a United Nations flag should be used instead.Armstrong himself said that his job \u0027was to get the flag there\u0027 and he was less concerned about what flag it should be.He said Congress had decided that the Moon landing was a US project.Co-produced by Steven Spielberg, First Man - which also stars Claire Foy - is based on a 2005 biography by historian James Hansen.First Man is one of 21 movies in competition for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival which will be awarded on September 8.           First Man is based on a 2005 biography of Neil Armstrong (pictured in 1969) by historian James Hansen\u0027First Man\u0027: Neil Armstrong film fails to fly flag for US patriotism"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/30/13/4F870CBA00000578-0-image-m-64_1535633404159.jpg","title":"Gareth Bale goes ballistic father law posts photograph new baby","story":"    Martin Rhys-Jones (left) poses with Gareth Bale (right) while he cradles the Bale\u0027s new son Axel Charles (left).

All the while, she said she continued asking her son for the time.‘So we had a minute-by-minute history of the time frame and the yelling went on from 5 after 11 until 11.25 and then it stopped,’ Wayne recalled.Wood\u0027s husband Robert Wagner, who was on board his yacht Splendour along with his wife\u0027s former co-star Christopher Walken, has always maintained that the 43-year-old star of West Side Story accidentally slipped and drowned as she tried to tie up a dinghy against the boat after a tumultuous night of heavy drinking.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close McCain friend, says he called Trump aides to intervene on the flag matter.Asked if he had missed a chance to unite the country, Trump told Bloomberg reporters: \u0027No, I don\u0027t think I did at all. I\u0027ve done everything that they requested and no, I don\u0027t think I have at all.\u0027In a week of solemn events marking McCain\u0027s passing, Trump has been and will be absent, a reflection of the animosity between the two men that lingered even after the Arizona senator\u0027s death on Saturday from brain cancer.          President Donald Trump flies Friday to North Carolina for an event and fundraiserTrump will also miss Saturday\u0027s service at the Washington National Cathedral, where former President Barack Obama, the Democrat who defeated McCain in 2008, and Republican President George W. Bush will pay tribute to McCain.Traditionally, sitting American presidents \u0027serve as a source of solace and comfort\u0027 for the country at times of loss and tragedy, said Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer.The Trump-McCain relationship left little room for that.          Vietnam War veteran John McCain died from aggressive brain cancer last Saturday aged 81          Trump refused to answer reporter\u0027s questions about McCain\u0027s death on at least four occasions during a White House briefing          Vice President Mike Pence  will speak at a Capitol ceremony honoring McCainIn 2015, not long after Trump kicked off his presidential campaign, McCain condemned his hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration, accusing Trump of \u0027firing up the crazies.\u0027Trump hit back, saying of McCain\u0027s 5-12 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam: \u0027He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren´t captured.\u0027 Trump received five deferments that got him out of military service.More recently, McCain accused Trump of kowtowing to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a July summit in Helsinki. It was, McCain said, \u0027one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u0027Trump in turn delayed issuing any statement after McCain\u0027s death. At one point, the U.S. flag atop the White House that had been at half-staff was raised back up, then lowered again after Trump drew fire from Congress and veterans.\u0027The president\u0027s actions in the first day of (McCain\u0027s) death were so petty,\u0027 Zelizer said.More broadly, Zelizer noted that many Republicans, including some in Arizona, had grown frustrated with McCain\u0027s moderate stances on some issues, reflecting the changing nature of the Republican Party that Trump has seized upon.Despite these tensions, most leaders from both parties in coming days will show they can rise above the political fray to recognize the passing of a respected colleague.McCain was involved in planning the events around his funeral. He made it clear to family and friends that he wanted Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, Bush and Obama to speak, but that Trump was not welcome.Friday\u0027s events in the Capitol will feature remarks by fellow Republicans Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, marking McCain\u0027s 35-year career in Congress.While he and McConnell had their differences, McConnell nonetheless has called McCain a \u0027lion of the Senate.\u0027The public will file through the Rotunda for six hours to pay their respects to McCain by filing past his coffin, which will rest atop a pine board catafalque originally constructed in 1865 for President Abraham Lincoln\u0027s casket.The pallbearers at Saturday\u0027s cathedral service will include Biden and liberal actor and activist Warren Beatty, alongside former Senator Phil Gramm and ex-Defense Secretary William Cohen, both Republicans.Throughout U.S. history, only 32 times have people \u0027lain in state\u0027 or \u0027lain in honor\u0027 under the soaring Capitol Rotunda, including 11 presidents and unknown soldiers from World War I to Vietnam.

This was a practice that was not just accepted, but treated as a rite of passage  Approaching old age: As most the last remaining members of the Konyak tribe are aged in their 70s, their unique culture is quickly vanishing. These men stand and proudly display their inked bodies like badges of honour          This Konyak tribeswoman poses in front of a wall adorned with buffalo skulls. She is decorated with strings of traditional necklaces. Despite their fierce reputation and intimidating appearances, the last generation of Konyaks are now over the age of 70 and are warm and welcoming to visitors          This Konyak man\u0027s unique headdress and arm jewelry has been made from the bones and horns of animals he slaughtered.

He wears a traditional necklace and holds a spear while his grandson is dressed in modern, manufactured clothing  Two Konyak women pose inside their homes where hunting tools can be seen hanging on the wall (left). The tribeswomen are still very traditional in their ways, using buffalo to haul logs from the forest and boiling hot water for tea in green bamboo by open fires. These women have only a few fading arm and shoulder tattoos          These women proudly hold two sharp three-pronged spears used by their tribe members to hunt and kill prey. They are beautifully decorated with layers of beaded necklaces and colourful shawls          Covered in horns: One of the headhunters poses with massive horns draped around his dody and pierced through his earlobes. His inked patterns on his back indicate his brutal past where each kill was rewarded with a fresh bit of ink  These men show off their stunning headdresses which were once decorated with the decapitated heads of enemy villagers. The Konyak were infamous for marauding the villages of other tribes, collecting heads, feet, and hands as trophies and hanging them on the biggest tree in their village           Wood carvings of native animals such as crocodile, lions and buffalo are engraved into a wall where large brass and copper cymbals hang on the walls of this man\u0027s house.

It was, McCain said, \u0027one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.\u0027Trump in turn delayed issuing any statement after McCain\u0027s death. At one point, the U.S. flag atop the White House that had been at half-staff was raised back up, then lowered again after Trump drew fire from Congress and veterans.\u0027The president\u0027s actions in the first day of (McCain\u0027s) death were so petty,\u0027 Zelizer said.More broadly, Zelizer noted that many Republicans, including some in Arizona, had grown frustrated with McCain\u0027s moderate stances on some issues, reflecting the changing nature of the Republican Party that Trump has seized upon.Despite these tensions, most leaders from both parties in coming days will show they can rise above the political fray to recognize the passing of a respected colleague.McCain was involved in planning the events around his funeral. He made it clear to family and friends that he wanted Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden, Bush and Obama to speak, but that Trump was not welcome.Friday\u0027s events in the Capitol will feature remarks by fellow Republicans Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, marking McCain\u0027s 35-year career in Congress.While he and McConnell had their differences, McConnell nonetheless has called McCain a \u0027lion of the Senate.\u0027The public will file through the Rotunda for six hours to pay their respects to McCain by filing past his coffin, which will rest atop a pine board catafalque originally constructed in 1865 for President Abraham Lincoln\u0027s casket.The pallbearers at Saturday\u0027s cathedral service will include Biden and liberal actor and activist Warren Beatty, alongside former Senator Phil Gramm and ex-Defense Secretary William Cohen, both Republicans.Throughout U.S. history, only 32 times have people \u0027lain in state\u0027 or \u0027lain in honor\u0027 under the soaring Capitol Rotunda, including 11 presidents and unknown soldiers from World War I to Vietnam.

In 2000, when she directed the film version, working with female pornography actors, it was banned in France for a time, and became a cult hit across Europe. Despentes, who took her pen name from the area in Lyon where she was a sex worker, was branded crude, outrageous and refreshing – the working-class daughter of postal workers from Nancy in north-eastern France became literature’s “voice of the marginalised”. Since then she has written 10 more books, won literary awards and redefined French feminism in her 2006 manifesto King Kong Theory, in which she detailed being raped at 17 while hitchhiking with a friend, when they were attacked and threatened with a rifle by three young men.But now, at 49, it is her funny, irreverent and scathing trilogy about contemporary Paris Vernon Subutex that has cemented her status as a “rock’n’roll Zola”. It has sold hundreds of thousands of copies in France, won a clutch of prizes, been shortlisted for the International Man Booker prize, adapted into a big-budget TV series and translated across the world.The saga centres on a record-shop owner who, when his shop closes, is evicted and has to blag nights on sofas from old acquaintances before drifting into homelessness. He was once friends with a rock star, Alex Bleach, who was found dead from an overdose in a hotel room, and has some video tapes that several people are hunting down. The sweeping cast of characters reflect all strata of society, from retired pornography actors to a vile sex predator film producer (it was written before the accusations against Harvey Weinstein were made public), an extreme-right thug who works in a high street clothing store and a Muslim student in a headscarf who – pointedly – is neither submissive nor radicalised, but simply knows her own mind. Despentes says she is sick of veiled women being stereotyped and made a political target in France.Vernon Subutex is written like a TV series – an art-form she thinks has taken over from cinema “and perhaps will even take over from the novel”. The trilogy chronicles what she sees as the creeping advance of far-right ideas through French society: casual racism and disdain for the poor.“It’s about the passage from the 20th to the 21st century and a feeling in France of losing the dominant position,” she says. “Western Europeans have been privileged from birth, feeling like the dominant power. It’s also about a certain loss of virility and how one adapts to that, men or women.”Despentes, who has spent decades on the frontline of the gender war, thinks we’re in an era of “great change”, citing the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. “This past year was pivotal,” she says. “For the first time, we’re seeing young women who view being at ease in the public space as their right. It has been a revolution ... Never was there a generation of women who were told so clearly: when you go out of your front door there is absolutely no reason you should come back in the evening down because a man has touched or heckled you.”#MeToo has kindled a revival of interest in Despentes’s King Kong Theory and a theatre adaptation returns to Paris this autumn. She thinks it might take a decade before we can fully assess the impact of these movements and remains wary of a backlash from the patriarchy.In Vernon Subutex, Despentes has created a male character who has captured the French imagination. In hindsight she feels readers and critics were a lot kinder to this hapless man than they would have been if it were a woman. “I think if there had been a female central character, the work would have been seen much less as a portrait of its generation and more as the story of a woman who messes up.”From her window you can see in the distance the Buttes-Chaumont, the vast park in the 19th arrondissement where tower blocks rub up against gentrified streets, and in which much of her story takes place.It was in this park that two Parisian brothers, the Kouachis, trained for jihad before carrying out the terrorist attacks on the magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015. The first volume of Vernon Subutex was published in France on the morning of those attacks. While Despentes was writing the third volume, the attacks on a Paris football stadium, restaurants and the Bataclan rock venue took place in November 2015. She altered the book to reflect society’s reaction.“The issue of terrorism is unavoidable in a contemporary French novel,” she says. “Just as the topic of refugees, homeless people and the rise of the far right is inescapable. Because I really wanted to make this novel a snapshot of France.”Despentes acknowledges the difficulties: “When there is a big terrorist attack, there’s stupefaction — that’s the whole point of terrorism. For several months after the Bataclan, I stopped writing it was impossible to continue because it seemed such a piddling thing to be doing. But then I thought what I need is the book I want to read right now, so I got back to it.”She pauses and says it might come as a surprise, but one of her biggest literary influences is Nick Hornby. “He’s got a way of writing about problems that when you read it, it’s almost feel-good. His books have been important to me in terms of learning what writing is, but they’ve also boosted my morale. There were times I wasn’t feeling great and I read two or three Nick Hornbys back to back and that perked me up.”In terms of French culture and thought, she says the biggest talent is now among women of colour: the writers Léonora Miano and Faïza Guène, the rapper Casey, the essayist Rokhaya Diallo and the documentary-maker Amandine Gay. There had been so little airtime given to these perspectives for 30 years that now it’s like an “eruption”.Despentes has said her own writing wouldn’t be what it was if she hadn’t given up alcohol at 30 and she is considering writing about addiction. At 35, she says, she “quit heterosexuality”. . “It’s easier to be a feminist when you’re lesbian. You’re not afraid of saying certain things, or of offending the person you live with because you’re too radical and your life isn’t in contradiction with your ideas.”Two events provided the seed for the Subutex trilogy. One was the economic crisis and how easily people in their 50s can lose jobs and homes and not be able to get back on the ladder. The other was the death of the singer Whitney Houston. “When Whitney Houston died there were articles about her and the relationship she had with a particular friend, who wasn’t well known, who stayed in the shadows, but who some implied was her mistress. That’s where the idea came from of someone who wasn’t well known but who was friends with a famous singer.”There is sex in Vernon Subutex, but Despentes says the trauma of the scandal around Baise-Moi runs deep and nowadays “there is a lot less sex in my books” she feels many contemporary French writers are tending to “remove the notion of sex” and getting a better reception from critics because of it. But it still has a place in French literature and art, she says, and needs to be talked about. She describes herself as a pro-sex feminist. As a former pornography reviewer who still watches vast amounts of the stuff, she is concerned about changes to the industry and the humiliation of female performers. With ever younger children accessing adult films, she says there needs to be more public discourse, special portals providing pornography for teenagers, education that there are different types of porn.“For a very long time, in the 70s and 80s, even 90s, pornography centred on a notion of women’s enjoyment. Today in international pornography – which all looks more or less the same – it’s the opposite: it’s a problem if a woman has any pleasure at all. Not all porn is about hatred of women but at the moment what is being watched is about that. What is going on in men’s heads, in their sexuality, when women’s pleasure has become a problem?”She wishes there was more critique of this by men. “Very few are asking how pornography got like this, what behavioural issues are at play.”Despentes also sees hypocrisy in the current arguments about prostitution and can’t understand why it isn’t treated by the law like any other work, and why men in positions of power, including male MPs, who use sex workers don’t seek to make their working conditions better. In King Kong Theory she wrote that having been a sex worker had helped her rebuild herself after rape. It’s about money, she says. Today King Kong Theory, with its account of Despentes’s rape, is the book she is most often asked to sign at events – and by a growing number of young men. When it was published 12 years ago, her publishers refused to use “feminism” on the cover. “There was a French way of thinking then that feminism wouldn’t sell, that feminism would put people off, that feminism was over,” she says. “But I knew I wasn’t the only person interested in it, and now that’s clear”• Vernon Subutex Two is published by Quercus.

Who owns your identity, and how can old ways of thinking be replaced?In April 2015, after a long and very public career, first as a male decathlete, then as a reality TV star, Caitlyn Jenner announced to the world she was a trans woman. Asked about her sexuality, Jenner explained that she had always been heterosexual, and indeed she had fathered six children in three marriages. She understood, though, that many people were confused about the distinction between sexual orientation and gender identity, and so she said: “Let’s go with ‘asexual’ for now.”Isn’t it up to her? What could be more personal than the question of who she is – what she is? Isn’t your identity, as people often say, “your truth”? The question is straightforward the answer is anything but. And that’s because a seismic fault line runs through contemporary talk of identity, regularly issuing tremors and quakes. Your identity is meant to be the truth of who you are. But what’s the truth about identity?An identity, at its simplest, is a label we apply to ourselves and to others. Your gender. Your sexuality. Your class, nationality, ethnicity, region, religion, to start a list of categories. (Raise your hand if you are a straight, male, working-class, Afro-Latinx evangelical US southerner.) Labels always come with rules of ascription. When we apply a label to ourselves, we’re accepting that we have some qualifying trait – say, Latin or African ancestry, male or female sex organs, attractions to one gender or another, the right to a German passport.More important, there are things we believe we should feel and think and do as a result. Identities, for the people who have them, are not inert facts they are living guides. Women and men dress the way they do in part because they’re women and men. Given that we connect these labels with our behaviour, it’s natural to expect other people to do the same. And that means we’re going to have to tell other people not just which labels they can claim, but what they must do if they are to fit our labels. So identities don’t just affect our own behaviour they help determine how we treat other people.At the same time, all the ascription conditions here are contested. Are you a trans woman if you haven’t transitioned? Is someone with seven European great-grandparents and one African one truly black? Would a Daughter of the American Revolution who renounced her American citizenship still be an American? So are the associated norms of behaviour: is a reform Jew less Jewish than an orthodox one? Is an effeminate man less of a man? Because identity, in the sense we typically use it these days, is a social category – something shared with vast numbers of other people – everything is up for negotiation and nothing is determined by inidual fiat. In this sense, identity is at once loose and tight.To say that the borders are contested is also to say that they are policed. Boys who default from gender norms of behaviour are deemed “sissies” girls are “tomboys”. Some old-guard radical feminists, such as Ti-Grace Atkinson, Marge Piercy and Faith Ringgold, have suggested that trans women aren’t really women. Black authenticity, too, is a perennial battleground. Here’s Pusha T on Drake, in a recent, widely publicised rap beef: “Confused, always felt you weren’t Black enough  Afraid to grow it ’cause your ’fro wouldn’t nap enough.” Latinos sometimes hurl the insult “coconut” at other Latinos who “act white”, suggesting that deep down they’re not Latino at all.So, in a liberal spirit, we could wonder: why not ditch the guards and adopt an open-border policy? Why not agree that people are whatever they say they are? We could follow the lead of Humpty Dumpty in Alice in Wonderland:“I don’t know what you mean by ‘glory’,” Alice said. Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. “Of course you don’t – till I tell you. I meant ‘there’s a nice knock-down argument for you!’” “But ‘glory’ doesn’t mean ‘a nice knock-down argument’,” Alice objected. “When I use a word,” Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, “it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.”By the logic of Humpty Dumpty, everyone should be able to assume whatever identity they choose. There’s glory for you.Or maybe not. Like all the words in our language, the identity labels we use are a common possession. Were everybody to follow Humpty Dumpty’s example, we simply couldn’t understand one another. If Toni Morrison isn’t a black woman, the term isn’t doing any work. The ability to apply identity labels in a broadly consistent way is what allows us to use them to tell people who someone is, and so, in particular, to tell others who we are ourselves. It’s because there’s some agreement about menswear that “man” is a useful label when you’re shopping. And labelling ourselves only helps others if it can guide expectations about what we will think, or feel, or do. “Lesbian” isn’t much use if you’re looking for a partner on Bumble unless it signifies a woman who might be open to sex with another woman.If identity continues to vex us, we should bear in mind that this usage of the term is historically recent. Until the middle of the 20th century, in fact, nobody who was asked about a person’s identity would have mentioned race, sex, class, nationality, region or religion. When George Eliot writes in Middlemarch that Rosamond “was almost losing the sense of her identity”, it’s because she is faced with profoundly new experiences when she learns that the man she thinks she loves is hopelessly devoted to someone else. Identity here is totally personal.Then sociologists such as Erik Erikson and Alvin Gouldner introduced the modern sense of the term in the 1950s and 60s. In recent decades, identity has exploded as a political theme identity groups, especially marginalised ones, sought recognition and respect precisely as bearers of an identity. Yet talk of social identities – the identity of “identity politics” – often rubbed up against these earlier notions of authenticity. Hence the faultline I mentioned. Don’t try to tell me who I am: this motto will have power as long as Eliot’s sense of an innermost self contends with the modern sense of identity as a vehicle and vector of recognition.Not all identities fit their bearers like a glove sometimes we’re talking oven mitts. Over the years and around the world, taxi drivers, putting their expertise to the test, have sized me up. In São Paulo, I’ve been taken for a Brazilian and addressed in Portuguese in Cape Town, I’ve been taken for a “Coloured” person in Rome, for an Ethiopian and one London cabbie refused to believe I didn’t speak Hindi. The Parisian who thought I was from Belgium perhaps took me for a Maghrebi and, wearing a kaftan, I’ve faded into a crowd in Tangier. Puzzled by the combination of my accent and my appearance, once our ride is under way, taxi drivers regularly ask me where I was born. “In London,” I tell them, but that’s not what they really want to know. What they mean to ask is where my family came from originally. They’re wondering about my ancestry and all that might come with it.The answer to the question of origins is that I come from two families in two places pretty far apart. My mother was English, a countrywoman at heart, who in the 1950s was working for an anti-racist organisation in London that supported colonial students. It was called Racial Unity. That was how she met my father, a law student from Ghana (then the Gold Coast). He was an anticolonial activist, the president of the West African Students’ Union, and a British representative of Dr Kwame Nkrumah, who was to lead Ghana to independence in 1957. You might say she practised what she preached.My father raised us with stories of his family, and one of the names he gave me, Akroma-Ampin, was that of the illustrious 18th-century general who founded his lineage. In a sense, though, it wasn’t really our family. Just as my mother’s people, being patrilineal, thought you belonged to your father’s family, my father’s, being matrilineal, thought you belonged to your mother’s. I could have told those taxi drivers I had no family at all.“Identities,” the cultural theorist Stuart Hall once observed, “are the different names we give to the different ways we are positioned by, and position ourselves within the narratives of the past.” Yet it’s also true that the labels can sometimes displace the narrative. In the case of my “racial” ancestry, efficient identity experts come up with a summary: black father, white mother, grew up in Ghana and England – got it. I recall attending a sports day, a few decades ago, at a school in Dorset I’d attended as a preteen, and meeting the now elderly man who had been headmaster in my day. “You won’t remember me,” I apologised, as I introduced myself to him. Hearing my name, he brightened and took my hand warmly. “Of course I remember you,” he said. “You were our first coloured head boy.” That wasn’t a formulation that would have occurred to me at the time but inasmuch as identities are social, my formulations weren’t the only ones that mattered.And precisely because social identities continue to be shadowed by that precursor sense of an innermost self, the dance on the borderlines of identity can be delicate. Shaun King, the Black Lives Matters activist, speaks, dresses and wears his hair in ways that are marked as black. When reports circulated that both the parents cited on his birth certificate were white (though, not his biological father), his wife responded with an artful online post, calling his story “beautifully difficult”, and declaring: “What’s white about him is white, and what’s Black about him is Black and always has been from the time he was a child.” In other words, accept the mystery.Mostly, people have. But there are limit cases. A much-loved episode of Donald Glover’s TV series Atlanta presents a mock reported segment about “Harrison Booth”, a black teenager (birth name: Antoine Smalls), who identifies as a 35-year-old white man. Preparing for his transition, he wears a button-down Oxford shirt, wanders through farmers’ markets, plays golf, and asks a bartender: “What IPA do you have on tap?”In the real world, the German model Martina Adam has announced that she has transitioned to black (with the help of melanin-promoting hormones and various filler injections) and, citing a baptismal ceremony she underwent in Kenya, is to be called Malaika Kubwa. The public response was no more supportive than that which greeted the retired baseball great Sammy Sosa when he dramatically whitened his once dark visage.There is a rich imaginative literature on African American “passing”, a groaning shelf that includes James Weldon Johnson’s The Autobiography of an Ex‑Colored Man (1912), Nella Larsen’s Passing (1929) and Philip Roth’s The Human Stain (2000). There’s also a rich tradition of such passing millions of white Americans have unsuspected black ancestry. Going from white to black isn’t nearly as common. But most people knew how they felt about Rachel Dolezal, who, carefully permed and tanned, had officially identified herself as black and spent a year running the Spokane chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, until she resigned amid suspicions that she’d fabricated reports of hate crimes she’d suffered. When her white midwestern parents outed her and sparked headlines, one black commentator suggested that Dolezal embraced “an a la carte blackness, in which you take the best parts, and leave the pain aside”. Dolezal now says she identifies as black, but not as African American. That’s a bid, though it doesn’t count if there are no takers.That identity is contested, then, doesn’t mean it’s up for grabs. We don’t own our words other people get a say.Identity norms are enforced in myriad ways, and the work that goes into entrenching them reveals their vulnerability. The fact that identities need to have some common meaning doesn’t require that we leave them just as they are. It’s obvious that conceptions of gender half a century ago suited some people better than others. No doubt many middle-class women were and are perfectly happy as managers of households and primary caregivers for children. (No doubt this arrangement suited many men, too.) But it left lots of women unsatisfied. The women’s movement challenged ideas about the proper places of women in the home and outside. Now, in much of the developed world, we mostly agree that sharing parenting more equally doesn’t make a woman less of a woman, or a man less of a man, and though the ideal of workplace equality remains unrealised, it is no longer controversial.Being a real man or woman once meant being straight. That suited many people, but it was deeply unsatisfactory for those women and men who found their erotic attractions were to people of their own sex. A movement gained momentum in the North Atlantic world, and engaged in a long project of reshaping the general understanding of gender, so that being homosexual was no longer a defective way of being a man or woman. But in those long struggles, the advance guard of these movements couldn’t simply declare a new meaning for womanhood or manhood. They had to negotiate with others, women with men but also with other women, gay people with straight people but also with one another, to try to reconfigure the shared understandings that shape the opportunities available to us. The trans movement is a predictable extension of these earlier struggles.When people responded to Jenner by saying she was just a man pretending to be a woman, they weren’t just being discourteous and unkind: they were taking the meaning of the words “man” and “woman” as fixed and non-negotiable and insisting on their right to use them as they always had. That’s what Republican legislators in North Carolina were doing when they passed a law in March 2016 denying trans people the right to use public bathrooms of the identity they claimed for themselves. When the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump declared that Jenner could use any bathroom she chose at Trump Tower, Jenner, who supported him in the race, took him up on his offer, posting a video of herself entering a women’s room. It was an argument about rights, but it was also an argument about language.At the same time, talk of the “LGBTQ community” sometimes runs aground because it seems to treat gender identity as akin to sexual orientation, and many trans activists are especially concerned to head off any confusion between the two. That’s why many transgender people would like to remove the “T” in “LGBT”. In the words of one Belfast-based trans woman columnist: “It’s not a sexuality. It’s a gender. It makes no more sense being included with LGB than if you were to add ‘female’ in there.” She explains that she’s now heterosexual, and asks, “when talking about issues that concern sexuality why is transgender included?” When trans women such as Jenner or the Wachowskis, the illustrious film-making siblings, decline to identify as lesbian, they may be responding to a sense that their gender identity should be considered separately from their sexual or affectional orientation.“What I want to do is to widen the bandwidth of gender,” says Alex Drummond, the Cardiff psychologist and author and a trans woman, who decided to keep her beard, while also forgoing surgery or hormones. Drummond, who identifies as lesbian, told BuzzFeed: “If all you ever see is trans women who completely pass and are completely convincing as natal females, then those of us who just don’t have that kind of luck won’t have the confidence to come out.” (Most trans women have not had genital surgery, according to a recent survey by the American National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.) Her project of “gender queering” hasn’t met universal acceptance one trans woman writer has likened her to “the older, oversized bully” who “throws himself into the toddlers’ sandpit and kicks everyone else out”. Did I mention quakes and tremors?But a conversation – a negotiation – has begun, gloriously. Every day, men negotiate with one another about what masculinity means. And not just men. “Man” and “woman” are part of a system of interacting identities. Nor, for that matter, can black and white and Asian and brown racial identities be negotiated separately by black and white and Asian and brown people. That’s why we have to resist the liberal fantasy in which identities are merely chosen, so we are all free to be what we choose to be. In truth, identities without demands would be lifeless. Identities work only because, once they get their grip on us, they command us, speaking to us as an inner voice and because others, seeing who they think we are, call on us, too. If you do not care for the shapes your identities have taken, you have to work with others inside and outside the labelled group in order to reframe them so they fit you better and you can do that collective work only if you recognise that the results must serve others as well.There will soon be 8 billion of us on this planet, and the chances are slim that every one of us will find that the particular set of identities in the society into which we are born perfectly fits our needs. Conflicts are inevitable, because a system of identities that fits snugly around me will not perfectly suit everyone else. Changing the old gender system that gave pride of place to the middle-class female homemaker and the male breadwinner involved making some people uncomfortable not least because, in the new configuration, their existing options were no longer seen as the unique and honoured ideal. The old racial system that we have gradually tried to dismantle in the United States offered something to all white people, namely the sense that, however little money or power or status they had, they were, at least, better than black people. This was not, evidently, great for black people. Not a few white people were discomfited by it, too their sense of justice was offended by it – they didn’t want whiteness to mean that. In some of the darker recesses of the internet, meanwhile, enthusiasts for the idea of Anglo-America as the home of the white race make it plain that the old dispensation suited them better. You might think there is no space here for compromise.But in our renegotiations of race, there are in fact compromises available. White people are entitled to ask that they not be assumed to be bigots or blamed for the racism of other whites. They can choose to distance themselves from the privileges of whiteness by refusing them when they see them – and by learning to see them more often. Black people can recognise that, since the system of racial identities is made by all of us, it’s absurd to blame inidual white people for the privileges they experience. Privilege is not something an inidual is guilty of. But, when it’s unjust, it is something you ought to help undo. And in that process you’ll discover that our identities can only become more livable for everyone if we work on the task of reshaping them together.So, too, when Caitlyn Jenner offered to “go with ‘asexual’ for now”, she was recognising that to get to where she wanted to go, she might have to compromise with others. It may not have been the best offer to make, but she was right to see that she had to start the bidding.

That’s when I underwent “therapy” with the aim of making me straight. I went undercover to report and expose this vile practice, and judging from my experience the film is hauntingly accurate.Set in 1993, Cameron (Chloë Grace Moretz), a teenager in love with one of her schoolfriends, is discovered in a clinch at a high school dance by her (male) date. Cameron is sent away by her horrified parents to God’s Promise, a Christian camp that aims to indoctrinate young people with the belief that homosexuality is a sin and that sinners can be healed with the help of Jesus.Moretz has said in interviews that in her preparations for the role of Cameron Post, she met young people who had been through conversion therapy. I also did that to prepare for my undercover role. In Denver I met Christine Bakke-O’Neil, who runs a campaign called Beyond Ex-Gay. Christine grew up in a fundamentalist Christian family, and when she came out as a lesbian, her family and her Christian peers rejected her.Christine moved to Denver to take part in an ex-gay ministry. But after five years of exorcisms, reparative therapy and many hours at the altar, Christine accepted she was not going to change having met other “survivors” of the ex-gay movement, she came out of the closet once again.I chose a Christian counselling body that specialises in “female same-sex attraction” (they do not use the word lesbian), Janelle Hallman \u0026amp Associates.I spoke to a therapist called Kelley (first via Skype for a 50-minute session costing $125, and later at their counselling centre in Colorado) about my family background and my expectations for change. I told her I wanted to be heterosexual and become reconciled with my family and the church.Kelley was keen to find evidence that I was sexually abused in childhood. When she failed to find any, she asked if my mother had neglected me. Despite my insistence that my mother was never neglectful, Kelley maintained that she could detect in me “a deep sense of shame”. “All you need to do,” Kelley told me, “is to start thinking of yourself as perfectly normal – as heterosexual.”Although I was masquerading as a middle-aged woman unhappy with her sexuality, who had made her own decision to ask for help to “convert”, the tactics used by Kelley were about making me feel like there was something deeply flawed about me that needed fixing, and that I was unlovable and unworthy until I was “cured”.I was told that female same-sex attraction (“nestling into each others’ arms, suckling on breasts, dressing alike, daily multiple phone calls or contacts”) was simply a collection of symptoms of emotional dependency. In Cameron Post, Dr Lydia Marsh, the character who runs the conversion programme, says to Cameron: “Your struggle is with the sin of same-sex attraction. The first step is for you to stop thinking of yourself as a homosexual.”According to Kelley, I must have been frightened of my father when I was a child, and that as a result I saw all men as scary. She implied that I might be a lesbian because I did not have close female friends at school, despite the fact that I made it clear that I was only rejected at school when it was suspected I was a lesbian.I asked whether I should access the therapy back home that would make me feel better about being a lesbian, rather than pursue a route that would make me lose my identity and support network. But at no time was it suggested that I should access counselling that would make me feel better about being gay, or even refer me to one of the UK’s many gay-friendly churches.The government has pledged to ban conversion therapy in the UK, but it is growing in popularity in Africa, South America and Asia, the regions where being gay is massively stigmatised andor criminalised. During my counselling – despite the fact that I was in character, and am normally confident in my sexual identity – I became depressed and anxious. Several hours of being told I needed fixing, despite there being nothing damaged, took its toll. After my return home, I informed Kelley that I was an undercover reporter, and told her a little about the effect her “therapy” had on me, but she seemed resolute in her views.I have been an out-and-proud lesbian since I was at school, and came out in 1977. The first question I was asked by a friend when she discovered my sexuality was: “If there was a pill you could take that would make you straight, you would take it, right?”Of course, there is no magic pill to make lesbians and gay men straight, and I for one would never take it even if there were. I hope the powerful depiction of the horrors of conversion therapy in The Miseducation of Cameron Post add strength to the campaign to eradicate it worldwide.• Julie Bindel is a freelance journalist, political activist, and a founder of Justice for Women"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d3c38adf0d7754fb62ee9ad89158672cc82c46/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5952dafe172780d1d29a4579a1006ce3","title":"the guardian view on modis mistakes the high costs of indias demonetisation","story":"Well now we know. Narendra Modi, the prime minister of the world’s biggest democracy, popped the expanding balloon of the Indian economy with a mistaken policy implemented at high speed in a bungling manner. It might be expected that the office-bearer be held accountable for this monumental mistake. Not a chance. Mr Modi is determined not to concede the folly of demonetisation, which cost 100 lives, at least 1.5m jobs and left 150 million people without pay for weeks.Mr Modi claims to be a religious man. That perhaps explains why his belief in this wrong-headed policy has never wavered. He had promised that “if any fault is found … I am willing to suffer any punishment”. Plenty of faults have been found, but Mr Modi is not interested in accepting them. Instead, he wants to let the arguments die – which might explain why the Indian parliamentary finance committee can’t seem to publish a report into the demonetisation debacle. Or he changes the subject, which is bizarre given that the government came into power saying it would focus on the economy. Or the prime minister warns critics about how the state can be unleashed on dissent, which is what the recent absurd arrests of\u0026nbsphuman rights activists appear to be about.Democracy’s conceit is that governments are accountable while in power. Mr Modi exposes this as hollow: he ducks arguments rather than faces them. True, India’s economic credibility has been dented – an important consideration given how portfolio flows are debauching emerging market currencies. The underlying angst about corruption is now being tapped by Mr Modi’s political opponents, who may make him pay for the high costs of demonetisation. Three large Indian states – all ruled by the country’s ruling Bharatiya Janata party – will go to polls later this year. The opposition Congress party looks set to sweep all three. There were reports Mr Modi wanted to defer these polls so that they take place simultaneously with next year’s general election. Such blatant politicking has rightly been ruled out. Rather than be humble and admit his shortcomings, he persists with excessive self-confidence. His hubris may mean his party meets its electoral nemesis. Voters ought to take\u0026nbspthe opportunity to punish Mr Modi for his mistakes if he won’t own them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9b04195cf94b285bee48f2de3926b124da15f20/0_481_7114_4267/master/7114.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f334a05b4f468ff31f82c4e97c05530a","title":"nasser hussain in the nets how a local cricket club got a first class makeover","story":"When Ilford Cricket Club won a community cricket honour, its facilities were soon transformed – shortly followed by league success and coaching sessions from stars of the game“Come on, keep those balls coming – otherwise we’re just people standing in a shed!”Nasser Hussain is not here to muck about. The former England captain is putting kids through their paces in the indoor nets of Ilford Cricket School. Famed in his pomp for a feisty batting style, he’s much the same as a teacher. Former England seamer, Sajid Mahmood, is in the adjoining net, teaching bowling.The kids can hardly believe their luck. They lap up the attention of both legends, grab selfies and get their bats signed. Proud parents film on their phones. Balls whizz through the air, and shrieks of excitement bounce off the walls. At the end of the class, a tiny youngster bowls out Hussain. The roof nearly lifts off the hall.Just an hour earlier, poor weather threatened to derail a much-anticipated day. ESPNcricinfo had been booked to give the full match day treatment to Ilford Cricket Club’s tie against rivals Ilford Town, courtesy of NatWest. Hussain and Mahmood were due to give a pre-match masterclass on the pitch.But after weeks of sunny, sweltering conditions, the day began with improbably grey skies, bucketing rain and heavy winds. As everyone sheltered in the clubhouse, the only sign of life outside was a cagouled woman, bravely walking her springer iel through the bluster.Then Hussain arrived, bouncing in with a chirpy: “Turned out nice again.” He was followed by the towering presence of Mahmood. As the energy began to shift, their masterclasses were moved indoors and a weather app suggested that a truncated match could be played in mid-afternoon. It was game on.Speaking after the classes, Hussain explained his pugnacious approach. “Look, cricket can be a dull game if you don’t get on with it,” he says. “I hate coaching sessions when all you hear is the coach – when you have an hour and the coach has spoken for 40 minutes and the kids are standing there bored.”In fact, the kids had been electrified and impressive in both the classes. Mahmood says: “I was really amazed by the number that turned out and the level of talent. Their technique was very, very good.” Hussain agreed, adding: “There’s a strong British-Asian community here and they pick up things very quickly because they follow the game so passionately.”Back at the clubhouse, Ilford chairman Maz Malik’s cheery energy was helping keep the day on track, despite the weather. “We’ve been having sub-continental conditions for six weeks, but today it’s back to the reality of English summer,” he laughed.A cricket fanatic – he says he’d get up to watch the Seychelles play the Bahamas at 3am – he has been part of the club since 1980, when he joined as a nine-year-old. As we speak, the razzmatazz of the day carries on around us: ESPN commentates on the match and NatWest’s virtual reality tent thrills kids. A barbecue sizzles away. Hussain, who cut his teeth here in the 1980s, and Mahmood chat with locals.“It’s been an exceptional day – we were very honoured to get selected,” says Malik. He describes the masterclasses as an “aspirational experience” for local kids. “It brings stars into reality. The kids see that these are human beings and that they can follow in their footsteps.”Gesturing to the NatWest “Cricket has no boundaries” banner, he talks about the “huge” changes he has seen in the sport. “Things have become less stuffy,” he says. “There has been less of the old boys’ network shirts, ties and collars. It’s become more accessible. We’re open for all – people of all abilities and backgrounds.”There are plans to host a “tape-ball” cricket tournament in August to attract those from south Asia and those who find the entry cost to full cricket prohibitive. The club has already subsidised some local youngsters who were referred by local authorities because of difficult circumstances.Members of the club, which was founded in 1879, say the atmosphere and relations across the board are much tighter since the involvement of CricketForce. Everyone has a new spring in their step. The first team recently topped the Essex Premier League for the first time in over 20 years. “I don’t see that as a coincidence,” says Malik.Captain Theeban Tavarasa, 31, has been involved with the club for 18 years, since his talent was spotted one day by Nasser Hussain’s father, Jawad, in the nets of Ilford Cricket School. “We are a very multicultural club, we have people from all walks of life: Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, English, Irish – we’ve got such a good society here,” says Tavarasa.“I believe this local community needs a cricket club like this. When you hear about so much crime and discord in London, a club like ours can help the community with cohesion. We can set a shining example.”Summing up the occasion, Sajid Mahmood strikes a similar note. “Today has brought the community together,” he says. “I think NatWest have done a fantastic job in supporting this. They’ve realised the contribution days like this can make towards community cohesion.”Mohammad Akhtar was the star on the day, with a pivotal 59 from 40 balls as Ilford CC (173 for 4) beat Ilford Town (170 for 8) by six wickets. Watching from the perimeter, Usman Ul Haq, a highly-tipped youngster who also plays for Essex, discusses the positive impact cricket has had on his life. “It helps you stay away from trouble and harmful paths,” says the 13-year-old, whose proud father Inam has been an Ilford member for more than 20 years.“Today has been amazing,” continues Usman with a smile. “How often do you have a first-class cricketer in your net giving you tips, then hanging around, signing your bats and then coming on to the club house to have a nice chat with you?“What I’ve learned more than anything today is that you don’t need to be good at the game to enjoy the game. This whole day has shown that you should play for the love of it. That’s the best way.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

With the help of NatWest – with which it has formed a formidable, multi-year partnership – it aims to reintroduce cricket to inner-city state schools, and provide resources and facilities for underprivileged children to learn how to play the game. Since its inception, more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – have been given a chance to enjoy the sport. Some of those who were introduced to cricket through the charity have gone on to play on the national stage and even faced international Test teams.Chance to Shine currently runs three projects in Liverpool – the largest in the Anfield area, with smaller cricket training clubs in Toxteth and Dingle.“Liverpool isn’t known as a cricket city,” says Sam Goodall-Walker, a league coach on the Lancashire Cricket Board and a lead coach on the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool. “One of the challenges we face is to change the attitudes toward cricket in the city to show that anyone can come down, learn to play and be good at it.”Goodall-Walker has been a coach on the Chance to Shine project since 2013, during which time there have been a number of successes. “We ran a project in Anfield, in schools that didn’t have resources to play cricket, where nearly all the students hadn’t played before,” he says. “In the five years it’s been running, five students have started playing regular club cricket, and two students play cricket for the Lancashire district.”Of course, the successes aren’t just in getting young people to play competitively.“We work with young people who come from disadvantaged backgrounds,” says Goodall-Walker. “For example, we worked with one young man called Michael, who has dyspraxia, and there were times in his life when he felt really isolated and lacked confidence.”He goes on to say that it was the extra, specially tailored coaching that helps young men like Michael thrive at cricket. “Disability cricket training was the thing that really boosted his confidence and gave him the extra support and guidance he needed, and he is now playing senior-level cricket.”Goodall-Walker also says that the Chance to Shine cricket programme has the power to help young people arriving from other countries feel at home, and give them the opportunities to succeed.It’s not just boys benefitting from the Chance to Shine project in Liverpool either. “There’s around 30 girls who play cricket every week at our club,” says 15-year-old Charlotte Dunn, who plays at Wavetry cricket club. Dunn has been playing cricket for the past six years, and says that the enthusiasm of coaches, and the supportive environment means that “everyone, regardless of your background, where you’re from, whether you’re a boy or a girl, can learn and enjoy playing cricket”.Part of that supportive environment includes pairing younger players with older ones, who can act as role models and mentors. “I’ve been paired with people who are still in primary school, and showing them how to play can really boost their confidence,” she says. It’s that, combined with how “approachable the club and all its staff are,” which she says has made so many young women stick with the club. “The coaches will make sure everyone’s involved and that they’re having fun. The most important thing to them is that we’re having a good time.”Goodall-Walker says that while the project has achieved a great deal of success, there’s still “plenty more work to do”.“We have to be realistic if we want to survive in the long term,” he says. “We still want to work with schools to give them a chance to try out cricket, and we still want to work with youth clubs and community centres who want to try out new things ... but there has to be a bigger cultural change for cricket to get the same amount of support as football and other sports.”Part of that reluctance, he says, is because of how cricket – particularly in its longer formats – is perceived in working-class, urbanised areas of the city, where it is seen as “very traditional, and associated with middle-class white people”.“Attitudes toward cricket need to change,” he continues. “But that can only happen if the game adapts too. It needs to adapt to a society that moves faster, and can’t afford to spend a whole day playing and watching cricket. We need more variation in the kind of games offered to attract more people to the sport. There’s no reason why cricket needs to be so traditional or old-school. That’s what’s stopping it progressing and flourishing in places where there’s so much potential talent.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting. That’s why they’ve supported it since 1981.

One 12-year-old chose a different path, and is now a graduate, cricket coach and teacherAt 12 years old Siraj Ali wasn’t a bad kid. But, like many of the young people he grew up with in the outskirts of Birmingham, he’d hang out on the street at night, sometimes get in trouble at school, and had anger management issues that could boil over.“The area that I come from, the crime rates are really high,” says Ali, a decade later. “In and outside school I was getting into a lot of trouble. I wasn’t being myself. I was being dragged into the wrong crowd.”Birmingham’s reputation for gang culture and the associated crimes – such as those involving knives and guns – is widely reported. In hindsight, Ali, now 22, reckons he was at risk of slipping into that “bad crowd” and that if things hadn’t changed he’d carry a criminal record by now and struggle to get a job.Thankfully, things did change – and in September 2017 he graduated from the University of Wolverhampton with a degree in sport, media, culture and development. He’s currently confident of being hired by a teaching agency and, perhaps most importantly for him, he’s teaching young people cricket at his local leisure centre, where he hopes he can help others negotiate the dangers of growing up in that neighbourhood.“If I hadn’t got involved in cricket something bad would have happened to me,” he says. “When I went to Street they just dragged me in another direction.”He’s referring to Chance to Shine Street, a charity that uses cricket as a means to build young people’s confidence, social skills and focus – while keeping them off the streets for a few hours a week. With the help of its official long-term partners, NatWest – who have a long history of supporting grassroots cricket to support communities and help make the game accessible to all – Chance to Shine Street has helped more than 38,000 youngsters since 2008. The broader Chance to Shine programme has introduced more than 3 million young people – half of whom are girls – to cricket since its inception.Now a coach with the organisation, Ali first encountered Street (as it’s generally known) as an angry 12-year-old. Invited along to a session by a local coach, he grew frustrated, smashed over the wickets and walked out. Luckily, both he and the coaching staff persevered. Ali went on to play around the country in his teens, continued playing for local T20 sides while at university, and is now dedicated to using cricket to help the kids coming of age in the Alum Rock and Saltley areas of Birmingham.“I’ve been coaching at the local leisure centre for four or five years now,” he says. “I enjoy the role because it’s challenging. With some of the kids you don’t know what’s going on at home or at school. But I always try to ask questions: ‘How are your studies? Are you getting into trouble? How are things at home?’”Ali, who coaches primary-school children as well as those in secondary school, reckons the key to Street’s power is the way cricket can help instil a sense of confidence in young people. “Street cricket is available for all kids, and it’s a fun and friendly environment,” he says. “These sessions are in areas where there isn’t much opportunity for kids, and they offer a chance for them to help themselves grow in many ways, such as in confidence. This is very important for kids – it can be very beneficial for them in their education.“When they play in a group, a big group of 13 or 14 kids, it’s a different crowd every time – one’s funny, one’s low on confidence, one’s very confident. They sit together, talk to each other, express how they feel and they become good friends. They work together like that. That’s the main key to our organisation – to help kids work together and get on and help each other.”Many of the young people he’s worked with over the past five years have gone on to a college education or university. The player-turned-coach attributes his ability to reach students to the fact that he’s been through the same things they’re going through the children can relate to him in a way they sometimes can’t to parents or teachers. “I understand them because I came from the same community and I’ve been through this all at a young age,” he says. “It’s all about understanding the kids and what they go through. Some of the children I have worked with are now playing for Warwickshire youth teams, so this is progress, and I will continue to help kids.”Mentoring is something Ali enjoys – and that influenced his choice of degree, which is focused on the development of young people. But it’s been a two-way street. At university, Ali found he was more confident than many of his peers, thanks to his time spent speaking to large groups of young people and working with people from across the charity and beyond.“When I first joined the street project as a coach, things were a lot different and I wasn’t confident leading sessions,” he says. “Coach Khaled worked with me and he started to review my performance. Week by week I was growing in confidence, and this confidence has been vital when I’ve had to make presentations at university or lead my group in front of the whole class. I am now a graduate and I am looking to continue to inspire kids and help them grow their passion for cricket and their education.”As a erse and inclusive sport, cricket truly has no boundaries, and NatWest think that’s worth protecting.

A student may have multiple exclusions in the same year. Nine of the 45 schools were part of the Outwood Grange academy trust, a multi-academy trust that runs 30 schools across Yorkshire, the Humber and the east Midlands.If your child has been suspended from school we’d like to hear from you. How long were they excluded for? What are your concerns about the rise in school exclusions? If you\u0027re a teacher we\u0027d also like to hear your experiences. What are the reasons given for suspending children? Have you noticed an increase at your school?You can share your experiences via this form. Your responses will only be seen by the , and one of our journalists may be in touch. We will consider some of your responses in our ongoing coverage. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere. A spokesman for the trust said it had taken over “some of the toughest schools in England” and repeatedly turned around their performance. He said that in many cases, the schools it had taken over had previously been excluding high numbers of children informally, meaning the increase in the number of official exclusions was misleading.The trust said pupils at Outwood academy Ormesby had beaten the school’s GCSE record for the last three years and that the school was oversubscribed. It pointed to an Ofsted report that praised the school for “bringing about change and improvement successfully, and at remarkable speed”.“Fixed-term exclusions are never issued for ‘minor’ incidents, but may result from a student’s poor choice of reaction or response to a reasonable request,” it said.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the fact that some schools were recording such high rates of suspension “should be a matter of huge concern to the government, and to the schools affected”.Some people believe schools are increasingly “playing” the system – getting rid of students who might do badly in their GCSEs and compromise the school’s performance in league tables.In June, an Ofsted investigation into the practice of “off-rolling” – where pupils disappear from the school register just before GCSEs – found that more than 19,000 pupils who were in year 10 in 2016 had vanished from the school roll by the start of year 11, the year when pupils sit their GCSEs.Figures published by the Department for Education last month found that there were more than 40 permanent exclusions a day (total of 7,700) during the 2016-17 school year, compared with a little over 35 a day the previous year. Fixed-term exclusions increased by about 40,000, to a total of 382,000, meaning nearly one in 20 pupils were given a fixed-period exclusion in that school year.In March the DfE launched a review into school exclusions, led by the former Conservative MP and children’s minister Edward Timpson. The government said the review would “explore how head teachers use exclusion in practice, and why some groups of pupils are more likely to be excluded”, but that it would not examine exclusion powers. It is expected to report by the end of the year.The launch of the review came after Cathryn Kirby, Ofsted’s regional director for the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber, wrote to secondary headteachers in the region to complain about the high rates of fixed-period.“Schools should only ever use exclusions as a last resort,” she said. “If not properly applied, being removed from school can disrupt a child’s education and affect their future life chances.”Secondary schools in Middlesbrough gave the highest number of fixed term exclusions of any local authority area in the last academic year, handing them to 11.67 pupils in 100. Doncaster and Barnsley also excluded more than one in ten pupils from secondary schools.Yorkshire and the Humber saw the most fixed-term exclusions of any region in the country, with an overall rate of 5.8 per 100 pupils. Inner London had the second highest rate (5.3 in 100) and the north east the third highest (4.9 in 100).Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said that it was deeply concerning to hear that so many schools were excluding such high numbers of pupils.“Real-terms funding cuts have forced schools to make behavioural and specialist learning support assistants redundant, many of whom supported pupils at risk of exclusion, including those with special educational needs or disabilities (SEND),” he said. “Alongside this, schools have lost external support because of the funding cuts to local authority specialist support services.“The reasons for a huge variance in rates of permanent and fixed term exclusions need to be examined carefully. However, it is clear that the competitive and fragmented system produced by the academy reforms encourages schools to compete for the pupils most likely to get high grades and increase exclusions of pupils who may be more challenging to teach.”A spokesperson for the Department for Education said the decision to exclude should be reasonable and fair, and that permanent exclusion should only ever be used as a last resort. “Statutory guidance also states that schools should consider the underlying causes of poor behaviour before excluding a pupil,” they said.“While we know that there has been an increase in exclusions there are still fewer than the peak ten years ago. We have launched an externally led review to look at how exclusions are used and why certain groups are disproportionally affected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/615aefcd0437eb9f9884ee1e7b7b75a5330e2ec9/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17406bcb83477947a79d0723a846d38e 700w","title":"a star is born review lady gaga bradley cooper","story":"Bradley Cooper directs and co-stars in this outrageously watchable update of the love story doomed by shifting fameIt’s the romantic epic of male sacrificial woundedness and it’s been regenerating like Doctor Who. We had it in 1976 with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson, in 1954 with Judy Garland and James Mason and originally way back in 1937 with Janet Gaynor and Fredric March. It’s even been regenerating obliquely in movies such as The Artist and La La Land. Now Bradley Cooper plays the boozy and downwardly mobile alpha-star laying his pride on the showbiz altar of the woman he loves. Cooper directs and co-stars in this outrageously watchable and colossally enjoyable new version, supercharged with dilithium crystals of pure melodrama. He appears opposite a sensationally good Lady Gaga, whose ability to be part ordinary person, part extraterrestrial celebrity empress functions at the highest level at all times.Here is the heart-wrenching gallantry of the grumpy, drunken singing star teetering over the apex of his fame, who discovers an unconventionally beautiful, talented young woman – single-handedly launching her on a glorious career while his own spirals downwards, redeeming his own former arrogance with this magnificently selfless act. He must accept the fate of being the embarrassing loser and has-been, finally not even allowed to be the wind beneath her wings.Cooper and veteran screenwriter Eric Roth are clearly inspired most directly by the StreisandKristofferson film. But in those closeups that Cooper awards himself, and his huge moments of emotional agony … well, he’s channelling a bit of Judy. He certainly de-machos the role, and creates a backstory of vulnerability. Yet the crunch question is: how are Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper going to reinvent that terrifying award-ceremony scene, when he embarrasses her publicly? Well, the climax of their ordeal is bigger than I ever thought possible. It’s the final station of the cross.Cooper takes his voice down a couple of octaves to play Jackson Maine, a gravel-toned MOR country-rocker doing stadium tours and keeping it together with huge amounts of booze and pills. He’s still a big success, but personally and emotionally he’s running on empty. (Cooper actually co-writes a few of his songs here, and his band is played by Neil Young’s longtime backing group: Lukas Nelson \u0026amp Promise of the Real.) He’s also suffering from encroaching deafness and tinnitus, which periodically bring him close to anxiety attacks and temper tantrums. He has to be shepherded by his manager and older brother, Bobby, played by Sam Elliott, for whom he has longstanding feelings of resentment, rivalry and guilt.Out of booze after a show one night, Jackson has his driver pull over when he spots what turns out to be a drag bar, where the boss lets a woman sing in non-drag: this is the extraordinarily talented Ally (Lady Gaga), who socks over a killer version of La Vie En Rose. Jackson is stunned, as well he might be. They have an adventure together and Ally’s unimpressed attitude to celebrity and her vocational attitude to music entrances Jackson. He falls deeply in love, even showing up at the family home, where she mortifyingly still lives with her dad, played by Andrew Dice Clay. Jackson finally gets her up on stage with him for a duet, and her greatness is obvious, but a dark shadow falls when she is approached by creepy Brit talent manager Rez (Rafi Gavron), under whose tutelage Ally seriously blows up. She is writer, singer, dancer and sex bomb. Poor Jackson is fame 1.0 and he realises Ally is fame 2.0, and the crunch comes when he is humiliatingly bumped from a promised opening slot at the Grammys, singing a tribute cover to Roy Orbison – of all the tellingly obsolete bygone stars. Ally, meanwhile, is up for three awards that very same evening.Cooper is arguably prettier than Lady Gaga, but she is the one who commands your attention: that sharp, quizzical, leonine, mesmeric face – an uningratiating face, very different from the wide-eyed openness of Streisand or Garland. (Weirdly, she rather more resembles Marta Heflin, playing the groupie-slash-interviewer who went to bed with Kristofferson in ’76.) Her songs are gorgeous and the ingenuous openness of her scenes with Jackson are wonderfully sympathetic. Meanwhile Cooper, whose screen persona can so often be bland and unchallenging, makes precisely this conservative tendency work for him in the role. He is so sad you want to hug him. Arguably, this film fudges some of Jackson’s dark side, by giving him partial deafness as well as alcoholism, but it is still a richly sympathetic spectacle.For all that it’s hokum, this film alludes tactlessly to something pretty real. It could be called: A Star Is Dying. The new generation supplants the existing one. For one star to get an award, a handful of defeated nominees have to swallow their pain, as the spotlight moves away from them. For one star to deliver the shock of the new, another one has to receive the shock of the old. A Star Is Born turns that transaction into a love story.• A Star is Born has premiered at the Venice film festival and is released in the UK and US on 5 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ff537e74fbba035a1846bdf585fa6d5188821c/0_215_3927_2356/master/3927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84e36d6147f3581343be96d01c7220dd","title":"netflix release model oscar films alfonso cuaron","story":"With the premiere of the new Oscar-buzzed drama from Alfonso Cuarón, the streaming giant is set to be heading to the big screen for a new releasing modelAt Netflix, “disruption” is everything. The streaming platform has grown into one of the largest players in the entertainment industry by zigging where all others zag: they ran Blockbuster out of town with their disc-by-mail service, they were the first ones to extract the gold from them thar internet hills, and then they remade the consumption of media in their binge-happy image. So, what’s Netflix’s latest game-changing innovation? Having purchased the rights to some of this fall’s most hotly anticipated titles, they’re now toying with the idea of releasing them in bricks-and-mortar theaters – actual buildings, in the real world! – for an interlude before adding them to the online content library. It’s a risky move, but Tinseltown experts say this whole “movies playing on screens” gambit may just be crazy enough to work.Yes, it looks like Netflix’s latest strategy for success is … doing the same thing everyone else has been doing the whole time. They’ve dabbled in theatrical releasing before, but that was limited to a handful of screens for Okja last summer, a far cry from the wide rollouts they’ve got planned, and all previous attempts have coincided with the films also hitting phonesTVstablets. And yet this does not feel like a regression for a company that’s demonstrated an ongoing obsession with racking up and knocking down new competitors, but rather a step forward, both in terms of Netflix’s growing profile as a business and their responsibilities as self-appointed cultural gatekeepers. CEO Reed Hastings once said that Netflix’s main competitor wasn’t any other media entity, just the need to sleep. He has yet to conquer basic biological function, but if this new move does come to pass, Hastings will take on the next-biggest challenger, moving weight classes from pint-sized Hulu to heavyweights Paramount, Universal and Warner Bros.It all comes down to Roma, the latest feature-length effort from Alfonso Cuarón and a turning point for Netflix company policy. Up until as recently as this past spring, the top brass has been adamant about their god-given right to never play their acquisitions on the silver screen. Netflix entered a staring contest with the Cannes film festival over this exact issue – head honcho Thierry Frémaux barred any film without plans to appear in French theaters from the main Competition section – and refused to blink, holding Roma from the Croisette as well as Paul Greengrass’s massacre dramatization 22 July and the long-awaited completed cut of Orson Welles’ unfinished masterpiece The Other Side of the Wind. (Netflix also has new features from genre king Jeremy Saulnier, the Coen brothers, indie stalwart Nicole Holofcener and, oh yeah, Martin freaking Scorsese in the hopper.) Now, Hastings may not be so committed to this once-ironclad principle if trolling the Cannes executive board counts as an art form, he is its highest virtuoso.Even for an outside observer, the reasons for his rumored change of heart aren’t all that difficult to perceive. Netflix is desperate to shore up their reputation as a legitimate competitor in the business of show, and walking away with a windfall of gold on Oscar night would put them beyond dismissal. Perhaps the idea began two years ago, when Amazon’s decision to give Manchester by the Sea a theatrical run paid idends with a slew of nominations from the Academy. Because if there was ever a film guaranteed to be an Academy competitor if not a surefire winner, it’s Roma, already heralded as a colossally scaled epic from an auteur who doesn’t bother with small movies. A recollection of the director’s boyhood in Mexico City during the 60s and 70s rendered in stunning black and white, it’s the sort of ambitious and immersive project that demands the stories-high silver screen instead of the humble laptop. In purchasing it, Netflix made a statement that they would be taken seriously no matter the price tag.If a change in corporate protocol means doing right by customers while showing movies as they were meant to be seen, then that’s just icing on the cake. Cinephiles have long been frustrated with Netflix’s distribution model, which amounts to little more than dumping the films they buy on to their streaming service with minimal fanfare. Film-makers aren’t much happier Noah Baumbach raised some hackles when he said that he wanted all critics reviewing his Netflix release The Meyerowitz Stories to see it on the big screen, even if everyone else would see it in miniature. While Netflix remains tight-lipped about how many people actually watch their programming, critics and viewers alike have found it difficult to stay on top of the latest round of additions, and fine pictures like Tramps or My Happy Family have gone largely unnoticed. Such festival favorites as Roma or the Coen brothers’ upcoming western anthology The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (the duo has confirmed that some sort of big-screen release is on the way) would be event-caliber premieres even if kept online, but this resolution ensures that they’ll be able to operate at maximum impact in the optimal viewing environment.Could it be that Netflix, initially feared as the final nail in theatrical exhibition’s coffin, may start to prop it up? Their choice to mount this push behind A-list fare like Roma while ostensibly leaving smaller projects online suggests the call was rooted more in fiscal strategy than the love of art, but good news is good news. Whatever the future may hold, we won’t be made to take in a new panoramic spectacle from Cuarón on a 13-inch screen in between bites of leftover takeout. Movies just got a little closer to being movies again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b110e6c94de55338b45ec5d141622b41f4aee9c/781_333_6905_4143/master/6905.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f9058de2cad76fc435f990012ece5c8","title":"cocktail club red wine slow downer","story":"A quality pinot noir paired with grapes, vodka and agave for a new take on sangriaInspired by beachside sangria, this is less sweet than its Spanish sister, but inspires the same feelings of holiday relaxation.

Mourinho’s unhappiness was signified by him storming out of the media conference following Monday night’s 3-0 defeat by Tottenham at Old Trafford demanding “respect”.Three years have passed since he won the last of his eight championships in four different countries – three of which are English titles – and he was asked whether he would remain one of the world’s greatest managers even if he did not win a ninth title.“Of course,” he said. “Did you read any philosopher? You spent time reading Hegel. Just as an example Hegel says: ‘The truth is in the whole,’ is always in the whole.” The inference was that Mourinho’s overall CV should be considered.Mourinho then pointed to Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino and Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp, neither of whom has won the Premier League. “Do you ask that question to the manager that finished third in the Premier League or fourth?” he said.Mourinho referred to United’s second place last season. “I had great success last season – that’s what you probably don’t want to admit. I analyse my performance and it is more important what I think than what you think.“I repeat that two seasons ago we had a fantastic season by winning the Europa League. This season and last everybody thought Atlético Madrid were amazing because they won the Europa League after being knocked out of the Champions League.Regarding Anthony Martial being in talks regarding a contract, Mourinho said: “With Martial you have to wait for that to be official because in this moment is not official.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5588fb60bef281482a0910da5ca8682df8c746ba/528_256_3045_1827/master/3045.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78d63904a6e9b767d5b22f6dde3bd454","title":"more mourinho mithering and saido berahino scores football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Andy Brassell and Lars Sivertsen to discuss Mourinho (again), Carabao Cup action, Declan Rice’s international dilemma, Hal Robson-Kanu’s international retirement and flesh-eating ratsJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

They play in Poltava, which was the site of the Battle of Poltava in 1709, between Peter the Great of Russia and Charles XII of Sweden. That resulted in a rousing victory for the Russians, and apparently put the kibosh on Sweden being a significant European power. So go pay your respects, Gooners. Just on that Red Bull derby: you might be wondering how this is allowed. And you’d probably be right to wonder that, given the influence of the sickly energy drink company on both clubs. The simple, if rather unsatisfying answer is that according to Uefa “no inidual or legal entity had a decisive influence over more than one club”. That’s because technically speaking Red Bull no longer own Salzburg, they merely sponsor them (and their stadium). So that’s all above board, then. Uefa checked the small print last year on this and ruled it OK. Maybe the stand-out game of the whole draw though, is FC Dudelange - the first team from Luxembourg to reach this stage of a European competition - facing yer actual AC Milan. The Italians might not be what they used to be, but still. Mercy. Thoughts? That’s not great for Arsenal from a geographical point of view: you’d imagine they won’t be wild about travelling to Qarabag (Azerbaijan) and FC Vorskla (Ukraine). But Lisbon is lovely, so there’s that.Chelsea, equally, might have liked to swerve BATE Borisov (Belarus), but both English clubs should make relatively easy work of actually qualifying. As for Rangers and Celtic, the latter are a bit of a sideshow next to the Red Bull derby - Leipzig vs Salzburg - while Stevie Gerrard’s boys have a spicy old trio in Villarreal, Rapid Vienna and Spartak Moscow. The draw in full so far...And now on to Pot Three...(Few gremlins in the system earlierI messed up. Refresh and it should all be fixed...)Now for the teams from Pot Two. I’ll go group-by-group from this point...Crespo is first up, to allocate Pot One teams to a group. And here they are:“Do you think Arsenal and Chelsea would rather end up with something like Milan, Spartak and Rangers or something like Astana, Qarabag and Sarpsborg?” asks Howard. “Second one’s obviously easier, but I can’t see people lining up to see it.”I suspect that the first priority will be ease of travel, so as not to make those Thursday-Sunday splits too much of a ballache. Thus Genk, Rennes and Rangers is probably the dream. You’ll be wondering who the ex-pros on hand are to awkwardly fiddle with those Kinder surprise balls - well wonder no more, because silky former Dutch midfielder Aron Winter strides onto the stage, followed by the magnificent Hernan Crespo. Winter won this pot with Ajax in 1992 and Inter in 1998, while Crespo bagged in the 1999 final for Parma, as they gubbed Marseille 3-0. Vali Gasamov, who you don’t need me to tell you was an Azerbaijani striker who did the rounds of various Russian and Spanish clubs in the 80s and 90s, is on the stage as a representative of Baku, the venue for the final. He’s asked if football is popular in Azerbaijan. He says football is popular in Azerbaijan. The coveted Europa League player of the year award, a gong with a storied history stretching all the way back to last year, is awarded to Antoine Griezmann. Undoubtedly his biggest achievement of 2018. He’s not there to collect it (Atleti are playing Celta Vigo tomorrow, so fair enough), but gives a gracious message of thanks from Madrid.While we’re waiting, remember this one? I hadn’t, until it featured in the Big Uefa Montage they’re playing before the draw.We’re on. It’s starting. Feel the tension.Get settled in for this. The ‘show’ starts at 12pm BST, but there will be all sorts of guff to plough through first. The Europa League player of last season, for example: Antoine Griezmann, Diego Godin and Dmitri Payet are the three lucky punters up for that one. They’ll fill the rest of the time somehow, too.As ever, clubs from the same country won’t be drawn together, plus for obvious political reasons, teams from Russia and Ukraine won’t either. Also, some paired clubs: these are teams that won’t be playing at the same time as each other, for reasons of telly. If, for example, Sevilla are drawn in groups A, B, C, D, E or F, Betis will be assigned to the first available group of G, H, I, J, K or L.So then. Arsenal and Chelsea fans, sit up, take a sip of coffee, because you’re about to learn what you’re doing with your Thursday nights for the foreseeable. Rangers and Celtic are in too, although the great big stinky spoilsports at UEFA decree that two teams from the same country can’t be drawn against each other, so no European Old Firm game for the moment. They’ve never faced each other in Europe, incidentally. We’ll bring you the full pots and so forth shortly, but a brief spoiler: Rangers are in pot four, alongside Luxembourger minnows Dudelange. Alas, Burnley will not compete this season, after they lost 4-2 on aggregate to Olympiakos, although given the size of their squad and how they’ve looked in their league games so far, that probably isn’t the worst news in the world. So how will our brave boys approach this competition? As an inconvenience that will make an absolute horsing of their week, or their best chance to actually win a trophy this season? Both are true, but I guess it depends if you’re a half-full or half-empty type of person. Any preference for who your team faces? Or if you don’t support any of the teams involved, who you would like to see play each other? Your thoughts, via email - Nick.Miller.casual@the - or Twitter - @NickMiller79 - are extremely welcome.

But together they showed me how to navigate the contradictions of my identityIt was a glorious July afternoon and my Arab grandmother – Teta, we called her – was being daubed liberally with margarine by my Scottish grandmother. On a goofy impulse, Teta had climbed inside an inflatable rubber ring and become stuck. We all took turns trying to budge it, but she was lodged firmly. So, Granny retrieved a tub of marge. My grandmothers wept with laughter as Granny smeared Teta with grease until the ring popped off like a champagne cork. We all cheered. Teta decided not to go swimming after all.When my parents met in the 1980s, they were newly arrived in England. My father was a posh international graduate student from Beirut and my mother was a working-class Scottish girl doing night shifts in the local pub while working as a librarian. They were married in a civil and a Muslim service, where my grandparents exchanged gifts to symbolise the union of our families: a kilt and a jellaba.My siblings and I grew up in London and negotiated our ided identity with no small amount of confusion and crisis. Our grandparents represented the extreme split in our heritage. We spent a summer under Israeli bombardment in Beirut with my Arab grandparents we spent winter evenings tucked up next to a gas fire eating mince and tatties with my Scottish grandparents. I had rarely seen my grandmothers in the same room until one year we decided to take a joint family holiday in Cornwall. I was 10.My grandmothers were my heroes in different ways. A chain-smoking maverick in a pinafore, Granny was from a small mining village in the middle of Scotland. She was a snooker connoisseur with a lusty baritone and a love of grisly police procedurals. Tirelessly productive, she crocheted blankets at a rate of one a day. Granny believed in fortification against discomfort she was a consummate master of the cosy. On cold evenings, she would warm our beds with an electric blanket and a hot-water bottle, then tuck us in so tightly that we lay bound to the bed, sweating and gasping for breath.My other grandmother is the most eccentric person I have met. Irreverent and misleadingly ditzy, she gleefully stole from hotels, trespassed for wild flowers and drove like a Beiruti speed racer. Teta was from a privileged background: she had grown up in a mansion and was the sister of a Lebanese prime minister. She was well educated and sophisticated. She had an ear for classical music, spoke three languages fluently and performed calculations in French. She was a friend of Kim Philby and Patricia Highsmith, but, if you asked her questions about the glamorous people she had met, she would produce breathless and giggly anecdotes about their pets.The summer we arranged the joint holiday, I counted down the days until I would be cosseted by so much grandmotherly attention. But, in the weeks leading up to the trip, I began to worry. Granny did not like to go swimming or go on walks. Granny went to church Teta cackled at the idea of mosque. Granny cooked Teta had a cook. In the narcissistic preoccupation of identity politics, my siblings and I assessed each other against a roving scale of categorisations: were we like Granny – pragmatic, stoic, competent? Or were we fussy, flamboyant and impulsive, like Teta?The summer began and we piled into a huge rented house. Granny was palpably nervous – she did not know how to be lazy. I had seen photos of my mother’s childhood holidays, with Granny wrapped in a blanket and a woollen hat on a grey pebbled beach. It was probably August. But now that we had secured a summer vacation with nothing for her to do, or fix, or crochet, Granny could not sit still. “It’ll just take a minute,” was her perpetual refrain as she leapt to her feet to adjust cushions or make cups of tea. Teta was the youngest of 12 she had grown up with an army of sibling caretakers, while Granny had been a lifelong caregiver. Teta was enthusiastic about the luxury of leisure time. Each evening, she counted down to the curfew of a permissible whisky, while Granny perched on the edge of her seat, unable to give herself permission to relax.One Saturday, I dragged them on an expedition to the tiny, slanted high street. I had an ulterior motive for the outing: a lurid confection I had spied in the window of a sweet shop. Vivid pink with a stripe of white through the middle, it conjured the Enid Blyton magic of a bucolic childhood I never experienced, as I grew up in the middle of London. I fantasised about this treat for days – I was delirious for it. When the afternoon arrived for a special outing to the shop, I was half-crazed with anticipation. After my first mouthful, however, I broke into grief-stricken tears. It was coconut-flavoured. I sobbed. The pink and white stripes did not taste different at all. I was devastated. A betrayal! My grandmothers locked eyes. “Don’t waste it,” they said in unison.While food waste hardly seems a foundation for a friendship, it was the first time I had seen them agree wholeheartedly. Their parsimony about food immediately became a point of solidarity. Teta would cut around putrid sores in fruit and then nibble them up: “Mmm,” she would say, “delicious.” Granny sawed the burnt crusts off my toast and then crunched them herself. That summer, Teta and Granny commandeered the kitchen. The meals were delicious, but the leftovers were a plague. During each meal, they were dutifully returned to the Tupperware, the same plate of rice and peas hardened into a glistening shell. Dingy rags of chicken skin sat in saucers of stiff dripping. Table crumbs were scattered on the lawn for the birds. At restaurants, Teta would fold tiny scraps into her napkin and hide them in her handbag, bringing them out again at home with a flourish. “Look,” she would cry, “liver!”Over pots of boiling stock, my grandmothers shared jokes and stories, poking fun at us, at themselves. Despite their differences, they shared histories of personal struggles. Two of Teta’s houses and their entire contents had been bombed and occupied. Granny had worked her entire life, securing her financial independence through difficult jobs: at a petrol station at a hospital, where she washed and prepared bodies after death. Teta was a breast cancer survivor. But their tragedies were discussed with a shared insouciant challenge to authority, an irreverent form of defiant resilience. Granny’s osteoarthritis pained her every move, but good luck to anyone who suggested she sit down and relax. With cheerful enthusiasm, Teta encouraged us to play catch with her prosthetic breast.At the time, I had been afraid that my grandmothers’ differences were an omen of something incongruent about me and my siblings. While I know as an adult that mixed-race families are not a magic solution to racism, as a child their friendship seemed to validate our bothness. One Sunday, when Granny made pancakes still lemony from washing-up liquid left in the pan, she and Teta sat down and ate the whole pile together. Watching them scoff and laugh and gobble up inedible pancakes acted as reassurance for my childish anxieties that it was possible to be Scottish and Arab, Presbyterian and Muslim that we could navigate the contradictions through squabbling, forgiving, loving and Tupperware.My grandmothers died within months of each other in 2004. In a total coincidence, Teta was buried next to a gravestone sharing Granny’s name. I think of their friendship whenever I scoop a froth of mould from the top of jam or boil up carrot shavings for stock. And I am still surprised that they agreed to waste the margarine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5df11464f8044d0da265fea8bd0fa7cb22621783/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09ab088ef0dfdc8ffd877f32d668aab6","title":"what you might have done in 1930s germany","story":"Ask instead what you might do todayOne of the smaller aggravations of these politically vertiginous times is a kind of scolding that you tend to see on Twitter, especially from Americans keen to advertise their activist credentials. “If you’ve ever wondered what you’d have done in 1930s Germany, or during the civil rights movement,” they tweet, “congratulations: you’re doing it right now.”My objection isn’t about whether it’s a good analogy. And I’m only slightly annoyed by the fact that their remarks are undermining, since what they’re doing right now, clearly, is sending sanctimonious tweets. As with most lecturing via social media, I assume they do it to make themselves feel better sending the tweet feels like they’ve done their bit for the day.But my real gripe is that I’m almost certain such exhortations make people less likely to take constructive action. It’s the sort of message that makes you feel as if the only response to a crisis (Trump, climate change… take your pick) is to quit your job and dedicate your life, and life savings, to the cause. Or at least to spend all of your free time on it. Suddenly, whatever little thing you might have actually done – a small donation here, a protest march or petition-signing there – seems so pathetic as to be worthless. So you end up doing less, in response to a serious situation, than if you hadn’t been persuaded it was so serious.A more useful message, though it lacks the drama of the original, would be to “choose the right counterfactual”. In other words, compare your actions with what you otherwise might have done – not some ideal world in which you became Mahatma Gandhi. If the real choice is between a small action and nothing, that small action is far from pathetic. (You’ll need to be honest with yourself, though: if you genuinely might quit your job, perhaps you should.) This logic applies beyond political action, of course. One common cause of procrastination on major projects of all types is the feeling that working on them for just a few minutes per day, or per week, “wouldn’t be enough”. But if the only viable alternative is working on them for zero minutes per day, that objection is meaningless: you’re using a definition of “enough” that means you’ll never do anything at all.There’s a parallel here to “social comparison theory”, which explains how we make ourselves miserable through “upward comparison” with people wealthier or more accomplished than us. (That’s why flying first class on Cathay Pacific is such a bummer: once you’ve reached that level of luxury, you’re moving in circles where half your friends have private jets.)But we fall into the same trap even when nobody else is involved. We contrast our actions with a perfect version of ourselves – an especially brutal form of upward comparison, since there’s no limit to what you can imagine yourself doing, and thus no real-world outcome that could ever measure up. Instead, compare downwards. Don’t dwell on what you might have done, ideally, in 1930s Germany. Ask what you might have done today, if this issue had never arisen. And then make sure you do at least a little more than that.

The issue? Who the second ticket is for, when you give someone two tickets as a present.For years, I thought it was a given that the “plus one” was the present-buyer. Thus: “Not only do I want to treat you, but I want to spend time with you.” And as messages go, you can’t do better than that. Everyone knows that giving your time is the most thoughtful of gestures. It’s why homemade things are more treasured than bought ones, and why I continue to serve the Christmas present Sharon gave me last year (homemade pickles to make you drool, mainly because they’re so hideously sour you lose control of your face) every time she visits.“What if they don’t want to spend time with you,” she quipped. “What if, actually, they’d prefer to take their partner, or kid? If you just assume the tickets are for you, you basically bought them for yourself. It’s a selfish gift.”Way to ruin the age-old pleasure of gift-giving, Sharon! Is this what responsible, conscientious adulthood is? Just one long, drawn-out process whereby everything you think is nice is systematically ruined? When I was younger, life’s revelations were freeing: finding out, for example, that boys did not have germs and were quite fun to squeeze – that was something joyful. Now I am an adult, all my life plot twists are downers rather than uppers.I wonder, sometimes, if there is anything left I love that adulthood can’t ruin. Tango Apple, that’s over (the sugar) my car (environmental damage) my cat (because owning an animal like property is a bit icky, although it’s probably OK because I am its slave).Besides, most gifts are a bit selfish, and that’s fine. Take Sharon’s nuclear gherkins: OK, she wanted to show off her pickling skills, but that doesn’t make killing off my taste buds any more thoughtful.So if it’s selfish to look forward to the face of a loved one lighting up a room, sue me. And if it happens to coincide with the jaw of my one show-off friend dropping to the floor as they are outdone, so be it. No one is ruining this great joy – petty, competitive altruism – for me. After all, what else is a proper adult other than someone who stands up for what they truly believe in?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d705cabc33c9bf24c3e835ea780da6f08b4e67/186_936_2649_1590/master/2649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2871ea5496e9aeaf7d1a594fcdc688f4","title":"wonga user craig jones compensation","story":"Craig Jones turned to the lender at a time of crisis and broke free after getting compensationCraig Jones is now a successful local politician but when Wonga was in its prime he was one of many people who turned to the payday lender for help. Jones was in insecure employment on a zero-hours contract in 2011 when he turned to Britain’s then biggest payday lender. There was a lull in work and he “needed something to tide me over” while he waited for his finances to pick up.He cannot recall how much he borrowed in total. Asked if it was several hundred pounds, he said it may well have been more than that. Later, however, he obtained more secure permanent work and was eventually able to pay off what he owed.In 2011, the year Jones became a Wonga customer, the company posted good figures: its profits tripled to £45.8m on revenues of £185m as the firm issued almost 2.5m loans. The following year the company told employees that by 2015 it could be valued at £15bn. However, in 2014 Wonga had a traumatic year: it was embroiled in scandal for sending out fake legal letters, ordered to pay millions in compensation and forced to write off £220m of debts owed by 330,000 borrowers. Then in 2015, regulator-imposed price caps on payday loans were introduced. The firm never recovered from that sequence of events, with waves of compensation claims playing a critical role in its demise.Jones was one of those who was compensated at that time and he received in the region of £800. In a tweet on Thursday referring to the Labour MP Stella Creasy, a leading campaigner against payday loans, he said: “Incredibly proud of the campaign @stellacreasy ran on this, fell in the trap myself and it was compensation from Wonga that helped me break the cycle.”Jones now works full time and since 2016 he has been a Labour councillor on East Staffordshire borough council.He acknowledged Wonga “was something that filled a gap in the market”, adding that with its instant decision loans it was “an easy, overly accessible way to access credit when you need it ... almost too easy”. At the same time, he said, it “preyed” on people who might not have been able to access other forms of credit.He added: “There needs to be some sort of campaign to make credit unions more accessible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26f34e41314891bd13d6216309124fa00c54bf98/0_0_1350_900/master/1350.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fe466fb4ffe0d431ce01267faa7128e 480w","title":"eminem kamikaze album review","story":"The hooks are middling and the moans at his critics get tedious – but a flurry of brutal potshots at witless SoundCloud rappers prove Eminem can still hit exhilarating heightsEminem’s 10th album arrived on streaming services, without any pre-emptory buildup, accompanied by a nonchalant tweet from the 45-year-old rapper: “I tried not 2 overthink this 1 … enjoy.” It’s a theme reiterated within the opening seconds of the album: “I’m just gonna write down my first thoughts,” he mutters, “and see where it takes me.”Not for the first time in his career, it’s easy to feel that Marshall Mathers III is being slightly disingenuous. Kamikaze is fairly obviously the product of a great deal of thinking indeed, largely of the stewing and fulminating variety. Clearly a not man at ease with the sanity-salving concept of Not Reading The Comments, virtually the entirety of its 45-minute running time is consumed with complaining about the cool reception afforded to his last album – 2017’s weak and audibly confused Revival – and bemoaning the current state of hip-hop. His latterday nemesis Donald Trump gets a look-in on opener The Ringer, but by the time he gets around to denouncing the president, he appears to have run out of bile, having expended it on critics, social media commentators and other rappers. He can’t summon any terms of disapproval he hasn’t already lavished on Lil Pump and Charlamagne Tha God. “My beef is more media journalists,” he admits. Similarly, when he does what you might call the “Slim Shady thing” – making queasy jokes about Harvey Weinstein and last year’s mass shooting in Las Vegas on Greatest, claiming that beating his partner with a baseball bat “only makes our love stronger” on Normal – you get the feeling he’s going through the motions, giving his audience the unconscionable stuff they expect. The weakest thing here might be Good Guy, a frailty-thy-name-is-woman saga of infidelity, marked both by a dreary beat and the sense that Eminem’s heart really isn’t in it. He sounds like a man killing time until he can return to the topics that really get him going: negative reactions to his recent work and the vogue for SoundCloud-disseminated mumble rap. On the one hand, the stuff about Revival’s reception gets a bit wearying and invites the obvious response: if its pop hooks and guest appearances from Pink and Ed Sheeran were as unfairly maligned as their author keeps claiming, why has he ditched them almost completely for its follow-up? Plus, there’s something odd about hearing Eminem, once the generation gap-cleaving voice of disaffected youth, sounding like a grumpy dad huffing from behind his newspaper in front of Top of the Pops, peevishly insisting that modern music is “mumbo jumbo” and deliberately getting the names of young artists wrong: “Earl the Hooded Sweater or whatever his name is”.That said, if you’re going to listen to a middle-aged man complain that hip-hop isn’t as good as it used to be, that it might as well be Eminem. Whatever you make of his point about hip-hop’s decline, the central plank of his thesis – that the current generation of SoundCloud stars lack his astonishing technical skills and his wit, and there’s something a bit off about rappers penning their rhymes via ghostwriters – is pretty indisputable. Unlike its predecessor, the punchlines on Kamikaze largely land on target. The section where he describes mutilating his own genitals in detail, not out of Slim Shady-esque nihilism but because he’d rather do that than listen to Lil Yachty, is genuinely funny, and you anticipate many of the rappers attacked responding with anything as potent. Moreover, he spends chunks of Kamikaze demonstrating his point about technical skill in considerable style. He sounds more alive and exigent on The Ringer or Greatest than he has in years, mocking latterday triplet flows and lyrical content before letting fly with hyperspeed bars and intricate wordplay. His alternately baffled and livid verse on Lucky Me, gradually increasing in intensity and speed, is fantastic.Kamikaze is a variable, flawed album. The hooks are nothing special – in the case of Nice Guy, a lumbering bass-heavy grind bedecked with a racked vocal from Jessie Reyez, it’s actively painful. The beats are of noticeably spotty quality, ranging from the clean, cool electronics of Fall at one extreme, to the distinctly ho-hum Venom, a pallid contribution to the soundtrack of the forthcoming Marvel movie tacked awkwardly to the end of the album. When it’s on fire, however, it really crackles, blazing considerably brighter than any Eminem album for some time. Whether that’s enough to restore its author to the centre of the action is debatable: its predecessor shifted a mere 1.1m copies worldwide, a fraction of the sales he is used to. As he notes on Stepping Stone, a thoughtful examination of the collapse of his group D12, times have changed. “One minute you’re bodying shit  But then your audience splits,” he raps, “you can already sense the climate is starting to shift  To these kids you no longer exist.” But at its best, Kamikaze makes clear that Eminem is prepared to rage against the dying of the light – and the sound of him raging can still make for electrifying listening.

I am 6ft 3in, and feel petite next to him. He is relatively svelte at the moment, having been ill during the past year with phlebitis and “the beginning of a pulmonary embolism”, but he has always been defined by being, in his own words, “fat and tall”. But this is, in part, what led Pierre Hache from being a kid from the Paris banlieues becoming a charismatic house artist, whose debut album One Trick Pony is a celebration of his identity as a black, gay man. It is enormously sexual, at times squelchingly acidic, and huge fun – energy he also parlays into his appearance in Gaspar Noé’s new dance-troupe movie, Climax.In June, Kiddy Smile was invited to DJ at an event at the Elysée. He agreed, assuming it was at Elysée Montmartre, a club everyone refers to by the first part of its name. Then his manager called to say President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte wanted to do something with him. “I laughed. ‘Macron isn’t going there!’ My manager said: ‘No, we’re going to the presidential palace. I’ve just been doing your security clearance.’”Some fans were furious. “A lot of queer people were sending messages about being very disappointed about me going there. But all of them were white. And all of them were trying to tell me to find the way to fight oppression. I understand that somehow they feel I represent them, but not all the time. People were insulting me and telling me I would have had a great career in 1943, collaborating with Nazis.”He made the right furious, too. He knew portrayals of the event would be controlled by Macron’s team – look, here’s the president and black people and gay people, all being smiley – so he wanted to make a statement that could not be misinterpreted 10 years down the line. Instead of wearing his usual peacock colours, he put on a simple black T-shirt with the slogan: “Fils d’immigrés, noir et pédé.” He translates: “Immigrants’ son, black and faggot.”“That shirt and the way the dancers were dancing upset a lot of people in France,” he says. “Mostly racist people. But it got a conversation started. Some people didn’t even know there were people who are black and gay. They were upset about me being black and gay and not being apologetic about it. They were upset I was proud.”Kiddy Smile recalls being young and seeing Madonna’s Like a Prayer video, in which Jesus is portrayed as a black man. “Something felt right to me about that.” He had learned to dance – appearing in the video for George Michael’s An Easier Affair in 2006 – and wanted more than anything to dance for Madonna. Then the call came to try out.“It was a one-week audition. She does workshops where she puts people into different situations so she can see how they work together,. At the end of that I was released,” he says. Then he heard from the Madonna camp that they had really liked him: but his size made it very hard to partner him with anyone. He was elated by the praise, but realised “she told a truth about people who look like me. I had to be honest. I had always loved music, and I loved to sing. So I thought: ‘Do your musical project and see how it goes.’”That question – what if it was possible to live freely? – is central in everything Kiddy Smile does, just as it was the central question in disco, and the other musical movements that have thrived as celebrations of LGBT sexuality. And, as he explains to me, it is impossible for a straight white man to understand what it is like to be black, to be the child of immigrants, to be gay. In the eyes of society, he says: “My crime is homicide: homicide is being black. And homicide with premeditation is being black and gay.” He puts it in practical terms: “I know you don’t get followed when you go into a store. Could you imagine the effect it would have on you if every time you went into a store someone was following you? Every single time. I know all the security people’s tricks. They have things that will set off the alarms in their shoe – so they can say they just want to check what’s in the bag. Try to live like that for 15 years, when you have to open your bag once a week for no reason. It has to mess with the way you live.”While he doesn’t think his album is conventionally political in any way – “but I get why someone who doesn’t look like me would see it as political” – he agrees there is a statement in making music that represents people like him. “My track Dark Knight is about finding a way to love yourself when you are never represented as somebody who could be loved. That’s powerful. I had to look at American literature in order to find a representation of myself. That’s not normal. Where are the books in French that talk about me? Why can’t I see myself?” It is important to remember that the event at the Elysée was a party – and that Kiddy Smile makes party music. In June last year, I watched him play a set on the beach in Cannes, in front of the Croisette. As feet shuffled on the sand, and 44 beats disappeared across the water, there were no questions about identity. There was just ecstatic, electrified dancing.One Trick Pony is out on Neverbeener Records"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba428dd1cd8f584dbd6bfe19dde8643ffd6699f/470_561_9728_5839/master/9728.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bee981a503ddc46118902558e9f29a0e","title":"alan rusbridger who broke the news","story":"The former editor-in-chief of the  looks back on two decades that changed journalism for ever. By  Alan RusbridgerBy early 2017 the world had woken up to a problem that, with a mixture of impotence, incomprehension and dread, journalists had seen coming for some time. News, the thing that helped people understand their world, that oiled the wheels of society, that pollinated communities, that kept the powerful honest – news was broken.The problem had many different names and diagnoses. Some thought we were drowning in too much news others feared we were in danger of becoming newsless. Some believed we had too much free news others, that paid-for news was leaving behind it a long caravan of ignorance.On this most people could agree: we were now up to our necks in a seething, ever churning ocean of information, some of it true, much of it wrong. There was too much false news, not enough reliable news. There might soon be entire communities without news, or without news they could trust.How did we get here? And how could we get back to where we once belonged?For 20 years I edited a newspaper in the throes of this tumultuous revolution. The paper I took over in 1995 was composed of words printed on newsprint involving technologies that had changed little since Victorian times. It was, in many ways, a vertically arranged world. We – the organs of information – owned printing presses and, with them, the exclusive power to hand down the news we had gathered. The readers handed up the money – and so did advertisers, who had few other ways of reaching our audience. But today advertisers can often reach consumers much more effectively through other channels. People are much more reluctant to part with money for news. And, however you measure it, there is widespread scepticism, confusion and mistrust about mainstream journalism.A few years after I became editor of the , I was invited to give an after-dinner speech at the Thirty Club – a private gathering of big commercial cheeses in the advertising and media worlds. It was March 2003 – three years before the launch of Twitter and the creation of the Facebook “news feed”, before the collapse of the economic model that had underpinned journalism for a century.As I stood up to speak, I was very conscious of the contingent from News International across the table. Les Hinton, the amiable if faintly menacing executive chairman of Rupert Murdoch’s newspaper group, was sitting right opposite me, flanked by Rebekah Brooks, editor of the Sun, and Andy Coulson, editor of the News of the World. I tried to avoid catching my colleagues’ eyes as I noted that the tabloids sold most, but were trusted least.I likened British journalists to fans of Millwall football club, who famously chant “No one likes us, we don’t care”. I knew what Coulson and Brooks were thinking: we’re in for a pious sermon from someone who can barely make a profit and whose sales are embarrassingly small. I could hear the ritual jibe from Piers Morgan, then editor of the Mirror, every time he saw me: “I sell more copies in Cornwall than you do in the entire country.”I waffled on more about trust how we’d lost it how to earn it back why it would matter so much more in the digital world. It was, even if true, worthy stuff. Afterwards, the three Murdoch colleagues were very friendly. They suggested we go on to a club we ended up drinking in Soho House till the early hours. The champagne’s on them. The speech is not mentioned. The evening is fun. Brooks and Coulson are good company. Hinton is full of seen-it-all bonhomie. Deep down, we’re all hacks together.Cut to 11 years later: Coulson was in jail, Hinton had resigned and Brooks had suffered the ordeal of a nerve-shredding trial at the Old Bailey – all because of reporting in the . That night in Soho House now feels like a lost world of Fleet Street innocence. A funny word – “innocence” – to use about Fleet Street. But we were certainly all innocent of what was to come – in virtually every way possible.In 1976, when I began my career as a journalist, the common route into the business was being thrown into the newsroom of a local paper to learn on the job. A week after finishing my finals, I swapped my university college – founded in 1428 – for the prosaic 1960s offices of the Cambridge Evening News, a mile to the east. There were not many graduates in the 20-strong reporting room of the CEN, a paper then selling just fewer than 50,000 copies a day. University types were – rightly – viewed with suspicion as arrogant interlopers who would trade the experience we gained in the provinces to secure a better-paid job in Fleet Street.The paper was owned by one Lord Iliffe of Yattendon, a largely absent figure who owned a 9,000-acre estate 100 miles away in Berkshire. More important to me was Fulton Gillespie, the chief reporter, known as Jock – a growling, silver-haired Glaswegian with dark glasses and the stub of a cigar permanently lodged between bearded lips.Jock saw it as his duty to school us in hard knocks. We would begin the day with the calls – a round trip to the police, ambulance and fire services. As we set off in the office Mini, he would deliver one of a small repertoire of homilies about our craft. “If you write for dukes, only dukes will understand, but if you write for the dustman, both will understand. Keep it short, keep it simple, write it in language you would use if you were telling your mum or dad.”He explained that police work involved keeping one foot on the pavement and one in the gutter. You got their respect by kicking them in the balls at regular intervals, because, in the long run, they needed us more than we needed them. That, he emphasised, was a good rule applicable to all those in authority. It had been hammered into him by the old hacks on the Falkirk Herald, and it would always be true. He repeated this often in case I had failed to grasp it: they needed us more than we needed them. We owned the printing presses they didn’t. End of.Around the same time, I learned a more personal lesson in the ways and obsessions of the press. While I was a young reporter on the CEN, I fell in love. The relationship lasted just under two years. I was a cub reporter, she was a university lecturer. Nobodies. The relationship caused some happiness, and some unhappiness to a few people – literally, no more than half a dozen either way. End of story. Well, almost – her late father had, some years earlier, been on the telly. So you could, at a stretch, make a consumable tale out of it: “Daughter of quite famous man has affair.”One Friday night, there was a knock on the door. A reporter and photographer from the Sunday Mirror wanted to tell the “story of our love”, as he put it, to the 4 million readers who then bought the newspaper every week. The reporter, a man called Richard, was charming, but when we politely declined the opportunity to invite him in, Richard’s tone changed. “We can do this nice or we can do it nasty,” he said abruptly, and then explained what nice and nasty looked like. Nice was for us to sit down on the sofa and tell the world about our love, and be portrayed in a sympathetic way. Nasty meant they would start knocking on the doors of neighbours and contacting our relatives to put together a story that would be altogether less heartwarming.It was a good pitch. All the same, we felt this was, well, private. We were living together openly, and made no attempt to hide our relationship from friends or family. But we had no wish to tell the whole world. So we said no.Richard and his photographer sat outside the house for another 24 hours. From time to time he would lean on the doorbell to test whether we had changed our minds. A week later, the pair reappeared to try again. Eventually we asked them in for a cup of tea, and I suggested I might ring Richard’s news editor to explain that we wouldn’t be talking. That seemed to do the trick. The story – nice or nasty – never saw the light of day.My life at that point had been learning to report councils, courts, freak weather and flower shows. That was what I understood journalism to be – a record of public events of varying degrees of significance. The ring on the doorbell was my first, sharp realisation that journalism meant many different things to many different people. And there were many different business models for “journalism”.I joined the  in 1979, on the same day as Nick Davies, who went on to become one of the most fearless and prolific investigative reporters of his generation. Our paths intersected for 35 years – his as a reporter, mine as an editor. When he came to see me in 2005 to propose that he would close his career by writing one last big series about power – specifically, the unchecked power of the press – I knew it would lead somewhere difficult. Nick was a heat-seeking missile. If he spent the next year digging, you could guarantee he would come up with something extraordinary. He always did.The germ of the idea had come from the Iraq war and the press’s role in aiding and abetting a conflict based on what now we would call fake news. But the elders of Fleet Street did not appreciate the diligent attention of investigative journalism when it was turned upon them. On the  we had long published a Monday media section – and, latterly, a media website. Over time, I was threatened by not quite every publisher or editor in London, but a good many of them.Editor 1: “I’ll always retaliate. We should be sticking together, not writing about each other.”Editor 2: “My circulation is three times yours. You write about me, I’ll write about you. In the end you’ll stop.”Editor 3: “I hate writing about the media, but I make an exception for the .”Publisher 2: “I’ll release the hounds of hell on you. You have to stop writing about us.”Some tried for bilateral deals: “You don’t write about us, we won’t write about you.” In general, they were as good as their word. If the  upset a rival editor or publisher, you could guarantee a form of retribution within days. It could be a snide diary paragraph or a threat to dig up dirt on  employees’ private lives – including mine. It could be a hatchet job about “troubles” at the paper. Sometimes these stories had a grain of truth, at other times they were simply invented. At first I was shocked that even broadsheet rivals would knowingly run untrue stories about us in “revenge”. After a while I understood that we were all supposed to see this as the great game.I had no idea what Nick would discover, but nor did it feel right that the Fleet Street elders should get their wish that their journalism should be a coverage-free zone. If journalism is a force of immense influence – and I think it is, and should be – then it surely deserves scrutiny.Investigative journalism of this sort is very slow, expensive, and sometimes yields very little direct return. No management consultant on earth would conclude that it represents a sensible investment of time or resources: a newsroom run strictly on metrics could never justify it. Big investigations (Watergate, for example) often work via the incremental disclosures of sometimes not very headline-grabbing material. The readership for each of the smaller numerous stories along the way would be barely measurable. The great editor Harold Evans used to say that an investigation only really began to count once the readers – and even the journalists – were bored with it.So how to justify obsessive reporting that has no apparent financial rationale, and may even be of little interest to the readers? The answer to this question is central to the idea of a newspaper. If journalism is, in some sense, a public service, then an editor has to understand the ethos of public service – something that is of value to a society without necessarily making a direct financial return. This means thinking of this kind of journalism in the same way you might think of a police, ambulance or fire service. You would, as a citizen, expect such services to be run efficiently, but you would not expect them to have to justify themselves on grounds of profit.There is actually a financial benefit to investigations, but it is a long-term one. Readers, on some level, want their newspapers to be brave, serious, campaigning and dogged. They like corruption to be exposed, overweening power to be challenged, and serious scandals to be unearthed. It reminds them what journalism is for. They admire it. They are even willing to pay for it.A newspaper that consistently breaks investigative stories will (with apologies to those who hate the word) build a brand. The Harold Evans Sunday Times was certainly a “brand”. To this day, it is regarded as one of the high-water marks of challenging 20th-century journalism. Brands have value. A paper that stands for nothing will soon lose its sheen, and then its point, and then its readers. But that’s not always an immediately winning argument if the financials are looking tense and you have impatient investors.Davies’s quest to explore the power of the press had resulted in a fiercely forensic book, Flat Earth News, which chronicled how many newsrooms, obsessed with traffic and with ever-declining budgets, had started practising what he termed “churnalism”. The word stuck, because so many editorial staff labouring under the pressures of shrinking resources and ever-faster output recognised the truth of it. But Nick’s inquiries, it turned out, were only just beginning. He came to see me in March 2009 to tell me about a shocking new story. We would later refer to this as the “heart-attack conversation”.A News of the World reporter, Clive Goodman, had been jailed in 2007, along with the private eye who had helped him, for intercepting the voicemail of three people who worked at Buckingham Palace. The editor, Andy Coulson, had resigned – but he was now the communications director for the Conservative party, and would soon be on his way to Downing Street when David Cameron became prime minister in 2010. The official line from News International was that Goodman had been a rotten apple: his phone-hacking was a one-off.Davies told me this story was not true. He had been contacted by a source who told him the idea that Goodman was the only person to hack phones was a joke. Loads of reporters were at it: it was how the News of the World had won so many awards. Hacking phones was the system, not an aberration.The police knew this at the time, but had done nothing about it. But now one of the other victims of hacking – Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association – was suing, and was trying to find out who had known what, and when they knew it.How many victims were we talking about? Nick had met a senior figure at Scotland Yard. The answer: thousands. So, not just one rotten apple then.The News of the World, rattled by this new legal action, had offered to pay Taylor an enormous sum – £400,000 plus £300,000 costs – to drop the action. Together with the payments to Taylor’s colleagues, News International was offering to pay no less than £1m to make the actions go away.Nick had been told that hacking victims included the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. Dozens of News of the World reporters and executives were implicated. Nick had access to emails showing that transcripts of 35 voice messages had been discussed by named reporters and editors. The “rogue reporter” defence was shot to pieces. According to Nick’s sources, the deal had been approved by James Murdoch, son of Rupert and chair of News International. The silence money had been paid, and the court documents sealed. If Nick was right, Murdoch’s most senior UK executive had agreed to a million-pound cover-up of criminal behaviour in his own company.This was an incendiary story. The Murdoch operation, taken as a whole, was ruthless. If we merely wounded the company, it would close in for the kill. We already knew that the police, for reasons best known to themselves, would not want to get involved. We would not have many friends in politics or the rest of the press. We would be on our own.Our story ran mid-afternoon on Wednesday 8 July 2009. It detailed the conspiracy to cover up criminal behaviour. It implicated the Conservative leader’s spokesman. It accused Murdoch’s executives of misleading parliament. It pointed a finger of blame at the press regulator, and it asked why the police had turned a blind eye. Fleet Street showed only mild interest in the story. News International had released an official three-page statement rubbishing our work and exonerating themselves. The company’s PR operation had been working overtime in Westminster. All the allegations were, they said, false. Rebekah Brooks wrote to the chairman of the select committee saying we had deliberately misled the British public. The Times took a piece from another former Scotland Yard officer (now employed by Murdoch) pouring cold water on the  story. It was reprinted in the sister paper, the News of the World, under a full-page editorial attacking us.It was a lesson in how the Murdoch organisation fought back. A senior executive on the Sun later promised to use the pages of the Sunday Times to show that I was the “biggest fucking hypocrite in the world”. It was as if the family of titles were interchangeable in being used to target anyone with the temerity to take on the organisation. The entire Murdoch UK newspaper organisation appeared to have been mobilised to call the truth fake and to promote fake news as the truth.Over the next two years, our reporting was gradually and painfully vindicated. On 15 July 2011, Brooks resigned from News International. Two days after that, she was arrested. She was eventually acquitted, but Murdoch’s appearance before MPs – “the most humble day of my life” – showed an organisation in moral and organisational turmoil.Those two years it had taken to fight off the Murdoch press’s fury and prove that Nick had been right were lonely ones. You live in a democracy, you assume that there are numerous checks and balances to prevent powerful people from doing crooked things. For the first time in my adult life, I doubted this was true in Britain.We had presented strong evidence of a criminal conspiracy at one of the most powerful media companies in the world – and no one wanted to know. Not the police. Not the regulator. Not – initially, at least – parliament. And not the British press.The British gatekeepers eventually found themselves on trial – or, at least, subjected to the unforgiving glare of a judicial inquiry – with the Leveson inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the British press, the government’s response to Nick Davies’s reporting, which opened on 14 November 2011.The two-part inquiry had been set up by the prime minister, David Cameron, in the wake of the phone-hacking revelations. Until this point, the British press financed its own self-regulatory body, the Press Complaints Commission. The British press had defended this organisation as tough and rigorous – right up to July 2011, when the elders had admitted it was pretty toothless after all, and should be replaced by something tougher and more rigorous.But there was a case to answer. Unchecked criminality within newsrooms was a moral catastrophe for British journalism and its role in our democracy. It was our Enron, our Volkswagen, our Deepwater, our subprime crisis. It was depressing to watch some colleagues retreat into the bunker and use their own bully-pages to close down debate by savaging anyone who offered even constructive help in rebuilding trust in the press. I loathed the threats and abuse directed at anyone who dared to disagree.The initial response to Leveson was, in fact, measured. There seemed, if anything, a sense of relief that we had escaped relatively lightly. But some of the aftermath was badly handled all round, and it did not take long for Fleet Street to circle the wagons – bitterly rejecting even the best-intentioned attempts to craft the most credible form of independent regulation.The dripping contempt for “the liberal elite” or their supposed notion of “public interest” was the bitter stuff of deeper culture wars. But Leveson and its fallout clarified how much confusion – or, more accurately, straight disagreement – now existed about the nature and purpose of what we did.It was becoming more and more evident that there was no neat agreement on what journalism in the public interest looked like. The Daily Mail employed many outstanding reporters, but the relentless, bruising, sometimes brutalising editorial ethos of that paper had little in common with the BBC or the Financial Times, any more than Fox News had much in common with the New York Times or Washington Post.Even among the so-called legacy media organisations, there was a yawning ergence in attitudes to what journalism should or could be. Scarcely a week passed without a withering attack from the Mail on the BBC’s editorial ethos or standards. Periodically, the Mail editor would castigate the , Channel 4 or the FT – either personally, anonymously or through willing surrogates. There was never a flicker of irony or humility in the eyes of the most complained-about newspaper (1,214 PCC complaints in 2013) bellowing contempt at the most trusted news organisations in the country (the FT had just seven PCC complaints in 2013).The elders’ fury at Leveson was dressed up in invocations of Cobbett or Swift. But there seemed little that Leveson himself was then proposing – as opposed to the botched subsequent wrangling – that would inhibit robust commentary or investigation into matters of genuine public significance. What, then, did they fear? The real fury – also apparent in denunciations of the European court’s jurisdiction concerning privacy – was reserved for judges who stood in the way of the lucrative pursuit of sex scandals.The tabloids have a business model that, in part, involves intrusion into the privacy of people in the public eye. In comparison to some other business models, it’s not a bad one. The public’s appetite for scandal subsidises the coverage of politics. Take away the sleaze and the sex and you can kiss goodbye to reportage of Westminster – that’s how they argue it.But it was hard not to wonder at all the puffed-up outrage. Was the Sun editorial team itself more free of “filthy laundry” or “sleazy antics” than any other newsroom? Journalists – and even some proprietors – were not known for leading saintly lives, any more than footballers.Did it matter? The Sun and Mail can surely have their economic imperative and ethics the New York Times and FT can have theirs. Fox News and the BBC: it’s all “journalism”. We can rub along in peaceful coexistence. That’s how it used to work, in a kinder age before newspapers began using the techniques of the secret police to spy on their targets.But now journalism is facing an existential economic threat in the form of a tumultuous recalibration of our place in the world. And on both sides of an increasingly scratchy debate about media, politics and democracy, there is a hesitancy about whether there is still a common idea of what journalism is, and why it matters.On 3 December 2013, I was led into a parliamentary committee room in Westminster to justify journalism. It was not a trial, but it felt like one. Waiting in the very next room were two of the most senior police officers in the country, who were investigating whether I should be prosecuted. Some Conservative members of the committee were determined to force admissions out of me and would, I felt sure, quite like to see me in jail.The Home Affairs committee was notionally looking into counter-terrorism. But today they wanted to know about Edward Snowden, the former US National Security Agency (NSA) operative who had given the  and others a very large number of top-secret NSA and GCHQ documents revealing the extent of state surveillance activities. Such a leak had never happened before.The head of MI6, the urbane former diplomat Sir John Sawers, had told MPs that Britain’s adversaries were “rubbing their hands with glee. Al-Qaeda is lapping it up.” He had smoothly delivered the next day’s headlines.The British press, in contrast to the overwhelming majority of journalists in virtually every other country, had not exactly bent over backwards to support the  in publishing the Snowden revelations. Some had been openly hostile. A former broadsheet editor had written that newspapers had no right to determine the public interest when it came to security. An Economist writer had suggested that he would have marched Snowden to the police if he had brought him the story. Once again, the British press could not agree what the public interest looked like.The MPs arranged in front of me in a horseshoe did not, on the whole, look friendly. I was on my own. The committee chair, the maverick Labour MP Keith Vaz, opened the questions. He came from a Goan family and had settled in England at the age of six after a period in Aden. We had not been going for long when he lobbed what felt like a fizzing grenade in my direction. “You and I were both born outside this country,” he said. “But I love this country. Do you love this country?”For a split second I was speechless. I recovered to say that my patriotism was rooted in the idea of a Britain that allowed a free press that could report on such matters. There were countries where the security services told editors what they could or couldn’t write. They weren’t democracies. I was proud to live in a country that didn’t behave like that.If journalists cannot agree on a common idea of the public interest – of the public service we claim to be providing – then it complicates the defence of what we do. And in an age of horizontal free mass media, it is even more important for us to be able to define and declare our values, our purpose – and our independence. Which includes independence from the state.But five years after the Snowden revelations, it is now apparent that states themselves are struggling with the digital disruption that first tore through the established media and has now reshaped politics. The digital giants have not only unleashed information chaos – they have, in the blink of an eye, become arguably the most powerful organisations the world has ever seen.‘Public” is, to some in the 21st century, a difficult word. We value public services, public spaces and public goods – but we sometimes struggle to know how to discuss them, create them, run them, fund them, regulate them, support them or measure them. We speak of public benefits and “the public interest” without ever satisfactorily defining them. In the UK, we treasure a public health service – but not to the point of financing it sufficiently. We trust a public service broadcaster above all private news providers – but regularly revile it.The ultimate defence of journalism is that it remains a public good. But how do we measure, or value, such a public good at a time when, in the words of the political philosopher Michael Sandel, “markets – and market values – have come to govern our lives as never before … Markets leave their mark. Sometimes, market values crowd out non-market values worth caring about.”A decade ago, talking this way about news would have been dismissed as the bleating of liberals – the despised “subsidariat” who weren’t commercial enough to produce decent journalism that the public wanted to read. (As James Murdoch infamously claimed in 2009, “The only reliable durable and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit.”) But now, faced with the overwhelming scale, popularity and sheer turbo-charged commercial power of the Silicon Valley titans, there is now an outcry across the media against the havoc that free markets have inflicted on the traditional press.After two decades of disruption, it may be possible that none of the old conventional business models can still support serious news in the public interest. But the challenge has never been so urgent: we need the essential work of journalism – the calling that should, at its highest, separate lies from the truth.This is an edited extract from Breaking News: The Remaking of Journalism and Why It Matters Now, published by Canongate on 6 September, and available at bookshop Alan Rusbridger will be in conversation with Beeban Kidron at the Barbican in London on 5 September.

But ahead of his trial, which began this month, he acted twice as his daughter’s election agent, at the 2017 general election, and in May’s local polls.During this period he was allowed to remain active in the party, even though the Coventry Pride group, for whom he had volunteered, barred him following the first court appearance.Aimee Challenor, 20, who was made the party’s equalities spokeswoman last year, was standing to be the party’s new deputy leader. She withdrew from the race at the weekend following her father’s conviction.One party figure said they were “agonised, horrified and furious” at the apparent safeguarding failure, and hoped the Greens, a party that remains heavily localised and largely dependent on volunteers, would learn lessons from this.A Greens spokeswoman said: “Aimee Challenor has today been suspended on a no-fault basis from the Green party of England and Wales, following consideration by the relevant internal bodies of a number of complaints that have been made against her.“An investigation will be conducted by an external agency into the circumstances and disclosures surrounding Aimee’s father being able to act as her election agent, while facing charges for serious sexual assault against a minor.”The spokeswoman added: “The Green party takes its safeguarding responsibilities and duties of care extremely seriously and is committed to learning any difficult lessons needed.”Aimee Challenor, a trans woman who has campaigned particularly on LGBT issues, has said she was horrified by her father’s crimes and “only learned the full details of them very recently, despite living at the family home”.The Green party, which reselects its top lineup every two years, is choosing replacements for the leadership team of Caroline Lucas, the party’s sole MP, and Jonathan Bartley.With Lucas opting to step back from the leadership, Bartley is standing on a joint ticket with Siân Berry, a councillor in Camden, north London, and a member of the London assembly. They are seen as the favourites in the race.Five candidates stood for deputy leader, among them Challenor and Amelia Womack, who has filled the role for four years. Party members had August to vote, with the results to be announced next week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf5dc1992e690211d383c7422fa5e2bf13db24a2/0_300_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16a1eb4a13ed0c21d056e924ca01fa10","title":"peoples vote seeks to sway eu newspapers with blind brexit poll","story":"French and German media given poll showing support for second referendum could growThe People’s Vote campaign for a second Brexit referendum is seeking to turn French and German opinion against a “blind Brexit” under which the UK would leave the EU without certainty on the terms of a future trade deal.The polling suggests that if the British public are made aware before the UK’s withdrawal on 29 March 2019 of the limited nature of the EU’s offer, and the lack of the protections for the British economy, support for a second referendum – which could keep the UK in the union – would grow.Diplomats among the EU member states are currently debating how detailed the so-called joint political declaration on the future relationship needs to be for 29 March.The declaration on the future trade deal will be a separate document to the main withdrawal treaty, and will not be legally binding, allowing the language to be vague if both sides of the negotiations decide to defer major decisions to avoid a public row.Some voices, including key figures in the European commission, believe a vague and aspirational declaration, which does not rule out the UK’s demands for the future, despite Brussels’ complete opposition to many of them, would be the safest way to avoid a no-deal scenario.Under such a strategy, it would be during the 21-month transition period – after the UK has formally agreed in the withdrawal agreement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protect EU citizens’ rights and pay a £39bn orce bill – that Brussels would formally reject the Chequers proposals.The People’s Vote campaign – which was boosted in August by a record £1m donation from the multimillionaire Julian Dunkerton, who co-founded the Superdry fashion label – is focusing on polling in order to convince key decision-makers that the UK’s withdrawal is not certain.Theresa May has previously suggested that it is only with a guarantee of the free flow of goods between the UK and the rest of Europe that the health of the British economy can be maintained.She has described the free trade deal that the EU would probably offer when negotiations start in earnest during the transition period as unacceptable.The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, a leading supporter of People’s Vote, said: “People in Britain do not want to be misled by politicians at home or by the European commission, but a blind Brexit would conceal from the British people the real consequences of leaving until Britain has left the EU – and from where there will be no going back.“In 2016, the leave campaign in the referendum pretended Brexit would control immigration, improve free trade, and mean more money for the NHS – but we now know Brexit can’t be all those things as it will be a terrible mess. What this poll shows is that the people of the UK are too smart to let the same people get away with the same lies.“The threat of a ‘blind Brexit’ or a disastrous ‘no deal Brexit’ is rising, and evidence is piling up that whether it’s a no deal, a Chequers deal or a blind Brexit it would be a disaster for our young people, for our vital public services and for our country. “Whether people backed leave or remain, nobody voted for this mess. That is why the momentum behind the demand for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal is building.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33185dbc828e500e97617570c3dd2935b09b3072/0_110_3076_1846/master/3076.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c2ae11f940bae9c3bdea96be704c663","title":"england v india fourth test day two live","story":"4th over England 6-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 4) A four, a four, a palpable four! Jennings swivels Bumrah’s first ball behind him and down to the boundary. He and Cook fist-bump. Ooooh, then he’s beaten by the fourth which slices through him, past the outside edge. He smiles, and he survives. What a day.! The players walk off and England trail by 21. 3rd over England 2-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 0) Cook plays out a maiden from Ashwin and with the shadows lengthening, India will get one more over. 2nd over England 2-0 (Cook 2, Jennings 0) It’s Bumrah, fresh from his triumphant 6. He runs in, clockwork toy action, pink-fleshed grips on both arms. Cook pats him away. The inswinger has him circling awkwardly, but they get a single off the last ball and Cook keeps the strike. 1st over England 1-0 (Cook 1, Jennings 0) Cook pushes the first ball to midwicket and they takes the single. Jennings opens his eyes wide and plays a succession of immaculate defensives shots. Breathe.And what can y0u say about Moeen? A table-spoon of confidence and suddenly 5-63 in pocket. Curran got the main man. And Broad was superb.Ashwin rubs his feet on the crease and prepares to bowl the first ball. Keaton Jennings is on a pair - and in last chance saloon.84.5 overs. India 273. Pujara not out 132. India lead by 27 runs. Ten minutes! Ten minutes! That’s how long England will have to bat this evening. But first of all, all hosannas and palms to Pujara - what an innings full of wristly class and calm farming of the tail at the end. Broad tries a short one, and it bounces hard and quick, Bumrah plays an ugly inside out shot and gets an edge from his glove high to Cook at slip.84th over: India 273-9 (Pujara 132, Bumrah 6) Pujara wristily steers the ball through mid-on for a couple. This is really excellent batting with the tail - though they do fail to grab a single off the last ball. India lead by 27Elliot Carr-Barnsley is growing frustrated: “How many yorkers have been bowled at Bumrah? Is that even still a thing?”Not many is I think your answer - though Bumrah has only faced 19 balls, so well has Pujara farmed the strike. But perhaps Broad now has a few up his sleeve. 83rd over: India 271-9 (Pujara 130, Bumrah 6) Broad to Pujara, he’s offered some runs, he turns them down, then loses his head to the penultimate ball and willfully heaves, and misses. But they skittle through for a single to backward point off the last. India lead by 25. 82nd over: India 270-9 (Pujara 129, Bumrah 6) And Root gives the new ball to Curran. It’s a maiden. India lead by 24.Dave, Dave - are you listening to TMS? They just mentioned an England transplant cricket team. See here:81st over: India 270-9 (Pujara 129, Bumrah 6) England take the new ball and heave-ho! Pujara dispatches Broad high for four over mid-on. Then an even better shot - it’s gorgeous actually. An extra-cover drive, head perfectly balanced above bat, drilled pointedly to the boundary. But they don’t get the final run ... Bumrah will face. India lead by 24. 80th over: India 261-9 (Pujara 121, Bumrah 6) Root now plumps for Rashid Pujara steps out and lifts the ball over mid-off where it beats the chasing fielder to the boundary. Then he gets his single from the last ball of the over. And the lead builds. India lead by 16. 79th over: India 257-9 (Pujara 116, Bumrah 6) Ah, but Broad bowls a full-length ball, Bumrah gets an inside edge and they scamper a single. Broad tries a shorter one which Pujara misses, but so does Buttler, and they run two byes. Pujara then rolls his wrists into the shade a classy 2. This partnership now worth 29 unlikely runs. 78th over: India 251-9 (Pujara 113, Bumrah 5) And India take the lead, Kohli applauds from the balcony. Curran bowls wide, then wider again - which is belatedly called by the umpire. Oh dear, and now India get their running in a tangle, and Bumrah is left to face an over of Broad. India lead by 5.“Developing Mr. Starbuck’s idea could help us end up having a good product.Here’s my version of it - there shall be eight fielders as the pawns. The two rooks should be the two bowlers from each end, the pacers. The two bishops would be spinners. The knights are swing bowlers who can make moves like no one else. Castling can be done with them, and be called ‘spells.’ These three pieces can change positions whenever any two of them are next to each other. The King is the ‘Coach’ of the team, since he is the most important, but isn’t really that active (case in point: Mr Shastri, who always likes a friendly nap). Finally, the Queen is the most powerful piece, the Captain. Both sides have the same pieces in the traditional starting position, with the faces perhaps resembling the players of the country’sregion’s team. Two sides will face off on the board (the Ashes edition will be a hit). They would be fun to play with, and collectibles one can brag about for a long time! “I’ve got the set where Curran was the Captain!”You’ve thought this through! Whither Toys-R-Us?77th over: India 245-9 (Pujara 110, Bumrah 4) Moeen, after a spell of 10 overs 5 wickets for 4, is replaced by Stuart Broad, who gets the chance to bowl at Bumrah. But Bumrah breathes, adjusts his helmet, sleeves, moustache, and shoulders arms. Repeatedly. India trail by 1. Max Williams is giving you all a kick. Well done Max, and thank you:“Following Dave’s email, I’ve also signed up as a donor – two minute job tops. Come on, people, it’s Friday afternoon – stop pretending to work (you’re on the OBO for starters) and do something important before you hit the pub. PS: shaping up to be another cracking Test.”76th over: India 245-9 (Pujara 110, Bumrah 4) Root reaches into the duffle bag and picks out... Curran. Good call, to try the man with the golden armbatetc. But Pujarah steps on the back foot and with a strong bottom hand drives the ball with piercing accuracy between the fielders for four. India trail by 1. And a good point here from OBO regular, Tim de Lisle - can Bumrah the batsman see India into the lead?DRINKS - and this game loses nothing in its fascination as it moves on. Re the chess - I don’t think it has to be a chess-themed game, just a chess game with cricketers for pieces. Like this Star Wars one. 75th over: India 241-9 (Pujara 106, Bumrah 4) Oooh this is getting annoying for England now, They swarm Bumrah with fielders, but he defends. There you go. And India trail only by 5. John Starbuck - this is genius. Someone do it in time for Christmas - please. My soon-to-be-ten year old would be in heaven.“Tanya,Bad chess eh? Would it be possible to devise a cricket-themed game using chess pieces and board. Kohli, as the King, would be most valuable and England’s top order the serried ranks of pawns. You can have more than one Queen, who are the top bowlers. It needs work ....”73 overs: India 227-9 (Pujara 101, Bumrah 0) The field come in on the fourth ball after Pujara gets a couple to long leg and moves onto 99, then England review an LBW that pitches outside the line - it’s not out - and England lose their last review. Pujara, invigorated, takes a dance down the wicket and lifts the ball over Moeen’s head and that’s his hundred! Well played!. His 15th Test hundred in his 61st match, his fifth against England and his second outside Asia. 72 overs: India 228-9 (Pujara 97, Bumrah 0) Pujara plays out Rashid’s over in a state of agitation, what with Bumrah being a batsman in the Devon Malcolm class. But they take a quick single off the last ball of the over and Pujara retains the strike. 71 overs: India 227-9 (Pujara 96, Bumrah 0) The ball before that wicket, the Indian batsmen had decided not to take the run. Many a slip between cup and slip (short leg)....? And Moeen has his five-fer - very well bowled. Ishant tries to defend, leg tangles with bat and is caught on the second attempt at short leg.70 overs: India 222-8 (Pujara 95, Sharma 10) Rashid, flighting it nicely, bamboozles Sharma who gets in a complete tangle to a googly - but survives. 69 overs: India 220-8 (Pujara 94, Sharma 9) Moeen appeals as Pujara tries to sweep him, but it is well outside the line. Pujara has enough, steps away and whallops Moeen over mid-wicket for four. The sun is lowering and the shadows are long as India creep towards England’s total - 26 behind. 68 overs: India 216-8 (Pujara 90, Sharma 9) That’s more like it. Rashid for Anderson. Rashid shouts for lbw as Sharma sweeps, it strikes him on the back pad but outside the line. Then Sharma chops at the googly, perilously close to his stumps.67 overs: India 212-8 (Pujara 88, Sharma 7) Moeen is tight but Pujara plays a wristy late cut, down to third man for four. Sharma shuffles around inexpertly but with a straight bat keeps Moeen out. And one LAST rhyme from Abhijato Sensarma :“India’s only hope now remains Che PuBut will he doAnd play with the tail like he is about to face a banFor tampering with the lead of the nation?That is the big question.He is known to bat in a shellBut he needs to get out of it as his team collapsesVirat Kohli and the others fellDue to good bowling and mental lapsesThere is plenty of time, oh Che PujaraBut you are our last hopeWe know we should respect you as much as the Burnley LaraExcuse us a good innings here can be the ropeWhich pulls in Indian and English fans towards your style alikeUnfurl those beautiful drivesHelp bring the total up to parityAnd you’ll be doing something much greater than simple charity.”I might have messed up the scanning there, sorry.66 overs: India 208-8 (Pujara 84, Sharma 7) Root perserveres with Anderson who keeps bowling short, and Pujara keeps turning down the single. Like bad chess. “Evening Tanya”. Evening Simon. “If it’s doggerel, or possibly genius, you’re after look no further than the incomparable William Topaz McGonagall. The closing verse of his masterpiece The Tay Bridge Disaster contains some of my favourite lines I must now conclude my layBy telling the world fearlessly without the least dismayThat your central girders would not have given way,At least many sensible men do say,Had they been supported on each side with buttresses,At least many sensible men confesses,For the stronger we our houses do build,The less chance we have of being killed.Sage advice from a master craftsman, I think you’ll agree. And applicable in all areas, especially Test cricket. ‘The stronger we our forward defensive do build, The less chance of our place by someone else being filled.”65 overs: India 207-8 (Pujara 83, Sharma 7) Moeen strokes his more-luxuriant-than-usual hair and turns... Pujara takes a quick and odd single off the second ball of the over. Maybe he knows something about Sharma that we don’t. Ah, here we are, Sharma has a go, over the top and they take three. Moeen has inspired more poetry-in -motion. From Mike McCArthy. I’m begging of you to please take their men”64 overs: India 202-8 (Pujara 81, Sharma 4) Anderson tries a couple of short ones, Pujara ducks ineffectively into one and is hit on the back of the helmet. Root and Anderson squabble over the field placings for Sharma, but after all that the last ball passes harmlessly by. India trail by 44.“Normally I’d try and say something pithy and witty - but I just want to say well done Moeen. So very pleased for him.”I think we all are Jim. What a come-back story63 overs: India 199-8 (Pujara 78, Sharma 4) The field closes in for the hat-trick ball. Six men round the bat. Moeen licks his lips. But Sharma stretches that lengthy front leg forward and pats it away. The tension remains for the rest of the over as Sharma sweeps right into Cook’s shin at short leg. And then makes real contact and sweeps him for four. This can’t last long.. .Moeen took six here four years ago against India. 62 overs: India 195-8 (Pujara 78, Sharma 0) Pujara now batting with a touch of panic, tries an upper cut at an Anderson bouncer which flies over his head into Buttler’s gloves. And then another, lower, dart, which again doesn’t make contact. And this from Mike Gooch. Thank you Mike. “Just registered following on from the update for Dave – having worked with a lady who had the same terrible illness and is now living a fantastic life in Ireland fit and healthy – I should have done it years ago.  Took less than a minute to maybe help someone in the future. Let’s hope Dave gets well soon. Puts it all in perspective.”61 overs: India 195-8 (Pujara 76, Sharma 0) A double-wicket cracker from Moeen who, wicket-to-wicket has now taken 4 for 8 in 16 balls. Not bad for a second spinner. He will start the next over on a hat-trick (he’s got one before).Shami misses a straight one and the ball clocks the top of off-stumpYikes. Ashwin gets down on one knee and plays an agricultural reverse-sweep, the ball hits the toe end of the bat and ricochets onto the stump. 60 overs: India 194-6 (Pujara 76, Ashwin 1) Anderson’s radar slightly askew here. Ashwin takes a swing at a bouncer, doesn’t make contact but Buttler fumbles it and India go through for a bye. A bon-mot from the eagle-eyed Olly Horne: “Handy how we’ve persuaded the opposition to wear clothing with appropriate labelling (i.e. shirts with ‘OPPO’ written on them). Unsure how this helps viewers in India though.59 overs: India 191-6 (Pujara 75, Ashwin 1) Moeen bowling with loop, guile and above all confidence. It’s wonderful to see. India wobbling here, trailing by 55.Moeen hits the rough and Pandaa turns it half-heartedly to midwicket where Root takes it ing catch knee-high to his left.58 overs: India 188-5 (Pujara 73, Pandya 4 ) Pujara flicks Andersonn nicely through gully. Three runs from the over.A sobering email from Dave Weirdigan - please read it and do register to be a donor if you can. An OBO transplant? I can’t think of a more wonderful thing. Dave, sending you all our OBO love.“Hi Tanya, Currently at St. James’ hospital in Leeds having blood transfusion to fill the shortfall caused by my leukemia.Not much signal here so  updates are keeping me informed... and excited - the match seems perfectly balanced, the perfect distraction.I need a stem cell transplant to ensure more years of cricket (both playing and watching) and don’t, as yet, have a donor - so we’ve launched an appeal.Being a donor is painless and signing up is simple and quick - it can be done between overs... please consider registering, you may save a life... https:www.dkms.org.ukenregister-now?utm_sourceSocialMedia\u0026amputm_mediumSocialMedia-dave\u0026amputm_campaigndaveBest wishesDave Brooks(aka Dave Weirdigan)https:m.facebookdave.weirdigan?refbookmarks57 overs: India 185-5 (Pujara 70, Pandya 4 ) Moeen finishes the over truncated before tea and Pandya sweeps, hard, for four to get off the mark. Btw, Pant’s 29-ball nought was the longest duck ever by an Indian in Test cricket. Justin Horton has some more thoughts on Pant:“Dear TanyaI am sure readers will recall the character from AG MacDonell’s England Their England (i’m sure they will - ed) who, told to go in and keep it tight, hits a succession of boundaries until he is advised it’s OK to cut loose - at which point he begins to block and scratches only a solitary single until he’s out. I was wondering whether Rishabh Pant might have received similar advice prior to the Third Test and this one.” Gripping stuff. England perhaps slightly  more buoyant as they break the tea-time pink wafer. You’ve got to feel for Rishabh Pant - IPL superstar thrown into an atmosphere as different as you could possibly imagine. But what an experience. Superb bowling by England, but .... crucially ....Pujara is still there. The deficit is 65.And in the grand tradition of cricket ditties, Andrew Benton offers up this:“Its great when Mo-Al,comes in to Bo-Al,With beardy chin, he doth spin,Can England go on to win?”Genius or doggerel?I’ll hand over to Tanya Aldred for the final session of this excellent day’s play. You can email her on tanya.aldred.freelance@the. Bye!56.3 overs: India 181-5 (Pujara 70) That’s the last ball before tea. It wouldn’t have been overturned even if India were able to review. It drifted in and straightened sharply to hit the pad as Pant got in a bit of a tangle. England lead by 65 runs.A big wicket on the stroke of tea! Rishabh Pant goes LBW to Moeen Ali - and India have no reviews remaining. Pant falls for an unlikely 29-ball duck.56th over: India 181-4 (Pujara 70, Pant 0) Pant is beaten yet again, driving loosely outside off stump at Anderson. He now has 0 from 26 balls, and something surely has to give.55th over: India 179-4 (Pujara 69, Pant 0) This is Stokes’s seventh over, and it might be time for a break. Two loose deliveries are put away for four by Pujara, a classy extra-cover drive followed by a tuck off the pads. A huge inswinger hits Pujara on the pad, prompting a hopeful LBW appeal from behind the wicket. Stokes did not appeal he knew it had done too much.Stokes ends the over with a gorgeous outswinger that beats Pant. Maybe it’s not time for a break he is still getting the ball to do plenty.54th over: India 170-4 (Pujara 60, Pant 0) It’s a quiet period in the game. Pujara is stockpiling singles, while at the other end Pant is playing his unnatural game with the tea break in mind. He now has 0 from 22 balls. “I have lived long enough to be told that there is a man who lives and breathes on this earth who goes by the eternal name of Paddy Farhart,” says Robert Wilson. “I have passed beyond bliss and fulfiment. Forget the funeral, bury me wherever you like (any old roundabout will do). I’m ready now.”Wait till you have one of his massages. Apparently they are brutal yet exquisite.53rd over: India 169-4 (Pujara 59, Pant 0) At Trent Bridge, Pant hit his second ball in Test cricket for six. This time he is struggling to get off the mark. He plays and misses at Stokes and then considers a dodgy single before being sent back by Pujara. Pant has nought from 20 balls.52nd over: India 168-4 (Pujara 58, Pant 0) Hawkeye is up and running again, it says here. England could with Anderson being in full working order. He hasn’t been at his best today and that’s another unthreatening over. 51st over: India 167-4 (Pujara 57, Pant 0) After a few minutes of treatment, Pujara resumes his innings. They jogged a leg bye when he was hit on the helmet, so Pant faces the rest of the over. Nothing happens.50.1 overs: India 167-4 (Pujara 57, Pant 0) Pujara misses an attempted hook off Stokes and is smacked on the helmet. It was a terrific bouncer which beat Pujara for pace. He seems fine, though the physio Paddy Farhart is on to check for concussion. There’s already a bump on the side of his head and he’s going to change his helmet.50th over: India 166-4 (Pujara 57, Pant 0) Apparently Hawkeye is down, which means no DRS at the moment. India are out of reviews anyway so it won’t affect them. Anderson replaces Curran and is worked square for a single by the excellent Pujara.49th over: India 165-4 (Pujara 56, Pant 0) The wickets of Kohli and Rahane have slowed the scoring rate, though Pant won’t die wondering if he gets in. It’s compelling stuff, full of momentum shifts. India are still ahead in the game, but not by much.“How was that not a no-ball from Stokes to Rahane?” writes Seventh Horcrux. “There was nothing behind the line? Am I missing something?”The bit of your foot that is behind the line doesn’t need to be grounded, and there was a millimetre of two of raised heel behind the line. It was so close, though, and he has bowled a few no-balls today.48th over: India 163-4 (Pujara 55, Pant 0) I said Stokes dismissed Rahane ‘yet again’. In fact that’s only the second time in this series, which is slightly surprising.

She insists she was on holiday. Her four-year-old daughter, Gabriella, has been staying with family since she was arrested in April 2016.In comments released before his arrival, Burt said it was “a crucial moment for Iran’s relationship with the UK, and the wider world”. He said: “Since the US withdrew from the nuclear deal, we – along with European and international partners – have reiterated our support for the deal and have underscored this support through mechanisms such as EU blocking legislation. “As long as Iran meets its commitments under the deal, we remain committed to it as we believe it is the best way to ensure a safe, secure future for the region.”At the same time, Burt said, he would be “strongly challenging” Iran on issues such as its ballistic missile programme and actions in other Middle East countries.Donald Trump announced in May that the US was pulling out of the painstakingly negotiated deal, which eased sanctions on Iran in return for an end to Tehran’s military nuclear ambitions.Earlier in August, Hunt joined his French and German counterparts to voice their “deep regret” at Washington’s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA), and vowed to protect European companies from US reprisals if they continue to trade with Iran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5cb1fe068c12264c08d88ae02c34e3ff7ac9ae99/0_29_3316_1989/master/3316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc3f3c4a2734e1faff42397732bbfef9","title":"eu recommend member states abolish daylight saving time","story":"The European commission will recommend that EU member states abandon the practice of changing the clocks in spring and autumn, with many people in favour of staying on summer time throughout the year.“We carried out a survey, millions responded and believe that in future, summer time should be year-round, and that’s what will happen,” he told the German broadcaster ZDF.“I will recommend to the commission that, if you ask the citizens, then you have to do what the citizens say. We will decide on this today, and then it will be the turn of the member states and the European parliament.”Any change would need approval from national governments and the European parliament to become law.The proposed directive could fall foul of the Republic of Ireland’s government, however, as it would open up the potential for the Republic to run on a different time to Northern Ireland for seven months of the year. Another potential outcome would be that mainland Britain and Northern Ireland would operate in different time zones after Brexit.Under current EU legislation, citizens in all 28 EU countries have been required to move their clocks an hour forward on the last Sunday in March and switch back to winter time on the final Sunday in October.Proponents of daylight saving have said the longer evening daylight hours in the summer help save energy and bolster productivity.But opponents have argued that some people cannot easily adapt to the change and feel it has a short-term negative impact on their health.Finland, which has the most northerly EU national capital, has called for the bloc to drop the biannual switch, while Lithuania has urged a review of the system to take into account regional and geographical differences.“The commission regularly receives feedback from citizens on the summertime issue, which often refer to what they perceive as negative health impacts of the disruptive time change relating to sleep deprivation and other kinds of negative consequences,” the commission said.“However, some also ask that the current system be maintained, as they believe it has positive effects.”The commission said in the consultation it had two choices: to keep the current EU summertime arrangements, or to drop the biannual changes and allow inidual member states to decide whether they wanted to adopt permanent summer or winter time, or a different time.Outside the EU, a handful of European countries have stopped switching between summer and winter time, including Russia, Turkey, Belarus and Iceland.Issues of clocks, hours and working days are much discussed in Spain, which has been stranded in the wrong time zone for decades. In 2013, a parliamentary commission recommended that Spain shift its clocks back one hour.Although the country used to be on the same time as the UK and Portugal, it has run an hour ahead since 1942, when Gen Francisco Franco moved it forward in solidarity with Hitler’s Germany. The commission also suggested that the long Spanish working day – including a two- or three-hour lunch break – be altered to resemble the 9am to 5pm model.Spain’s new socialist government signalled its support for the move on Friday afternoon. “Maybe Spain should be in a different time zone,” said the foreign minister, Josep Borrell. “Frankly, I don’t know. Let’s give the European parliament the chance to see whether it is capable of finding a common denominator among countries that are in such different geographic situations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace6f2077ea6f3fb5fea4d20f0d3a72d32b3548a/0_49_1565_939/master/1565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bbdfac0b256546ffc1e6539a8708348","title":"stalinist truman show artist paid 400 people to live as soviet citizens","story":"Participants lived in replica Stalin-era research institute as part of three-year art projectIn an art project that has been compared to The Truman Show, Big Brother and the Charlie Kaufman film Synecdoche, New York, a Russian artist has paid 400 people to live for three years in a fictional but functioning Stalin-era research institute.In an experiment long anticipated in the film and art worlds but confirmed by the  on Friday, Ilya Khrzhanovsky created an institute of theoretical physics in eastern Ukraine modelled on the shadowy facilities which existed in the Soviet Union from the 1930s to the 1950s.Inside it were more than 400 real people, who relived 30 years of the Soviet experience in three years between 2008-11, eating the same food, wearing the same clothes, and obeying the same rules as Soviet citizens would have.People fell in and out of love, conceived 14 children, formed friendships and made enemies, according to executive producer Martine d’Anglejan-Chatillon.Khrzhanovsky used the story of Soviet physicist Lev Landau – whose nickname also provided the project’s title, DAU – as the basis for his fictional world. “It is really to show how people are, it is not particular to that culture or that time,” says d’Anglejan-Chatillon. “It is about looking at what human nature is capable of, under a microscope, and the capacity for beauty and intellect and optimism and change or a capacity for the opposite.“In a way what Ilya created was an encyclopaedia of human relationships and human nature and how things develop over time in people.”It has been a sprawling project shrouded in secrecy. Very few journalists have ever been given access. One who was, Michael Idov, wrote a piece for GQ in 2011 headlined The Movie Set That Ate Itself, describing Khrzhanovsky as “unhinged”.James Meek, a novelist and former  Moscow correspondent, was in 2015 invited to a building on Piccadilly where Khrzhanovsky has spent years pulling the project together. He wrote a piece for the London Review of Books in which he said “I felt I’d crossed a membrane into another medium.”The research facility was also a vast movie set and for some of the time the participants were filmed by the German cinematographer Jürgen Jürges. Over 700 hours of footage was captured, and the film, DAU Freiheit, or DAU Freedom, will be shown to the public for the first time at an art installation in Berlin this October. “The world has been waiting for this,” said d’Anglejan-Chatillon. “The film world has been anticipating this for a long time.”For the event, a large section of the Berlin Wall will be rebuilt on Unter den Linden boulevard in the German capital, creating a walled-in “city within a city”. Visitors must purchase “visas” online and hand over their phones before entering. The project will end with a ritualistic tearing down of the wall on 9 November, exactly 29 years after the event in 1989.The installation in Berlin will also feature performances and live interventions by artists including Brian Eno and Robert del Naja of Massive Attack.“You often hear things described as ‘ambitious’. Nothing I’ve ever encountered comes close to the ambition of DAU,” said Eno of the exhibit.“It’s the most extraordinary and multi-layered art-project I’ve ever heard of, involving many thousands of people – artists, actors, musicians, artisans, lighting designers, editors, cinematographers, officials, cartographers, scientists, shamans, and thousands of ordinary humans – and it’s still growing.”Khrzhanovsky’s project has piqued the interest of many distinguished artists and scientists. Visitors and participants in DAU include the artists Marina Abramović and Carsten Höller, opera director Peter Sellars, Nobel prize-winning physicist David Gross, and mathematician Shing-Tung Ya. Events in Paris, before Christmas, and London, in the new year, will follow the project. In Berlin the installation will be hosted by the Berliner Festspiele arts festival. Details for London and Paris have yet to be released."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3614124.1535729189!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"big tree pub to open for the last time on all ireland final day","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Big Tree in Dublin. Photograph: Google Street ViewOne of north Dublin’s best-known GAA match-day watering holes, the Big Tree, will open for the final time on Sunday ahead of the conversion of its site into a 163-bedroom hotel.While a pub will operate in the new development, it will be reduced in size from the current Big Tree.The two-storey buildings surrounding the pub are to be demolished and replaced with a development up to six-storeys high.The three-storey pub building, located on the corner of Dorset Street and the North Circular Road and which dates from the 1830s, will be retained as part of the development, but an extra storey is to be added to its height. Permission had been granted earlier this year to redevelop the site as a student accommodation complex, with a similar number of bedrooms. However, the pub and surrounding buildings were subsequently sold to the Dublin Loft Company, which decided a hotel would be “more appropriate and economically viable at this location”. The company sought permission from Dublin City Council last June for the hotel development.Local residents made submissions to the council raising concerns about the “overdevelopment of the site”, the height of the hotel, and the fear the Big Tree would be converted into a “superpub” under the plans. Others put forward the suggestion that the site should be used for housing.However, the council granted permission, saying that hotel accommodation was acceptable at the site and that “there is no link from the hotel ground floor to the Big Tree tavern which is considered appropriate and to avoid the creation of a potential superpub”.It added that the size of the proposed hotel was “broadly in line” with the previously permitted student accommodation scheme and the six-storey height was within the limits for the area.“The subject site is situated within the inner city where the maximum permissible height for commercial development is 28m. The maximum height of the proposed development is 21.6m.”It added that the “low-rise and low-density development of surrounding two-storey residential dwellings is inconsistent with what would be a sustainable form of development for an inner city location”. These houses “cannot realistically determine the building heights of new developments”, it said. The Big Tree, one of the closest pubs to Croke Park, has only been open on a limited basis in recent months, and will see its final customers on Sunday when Dublin play Tyrone in the All-Ireland senior football final.

Photograph: Nick Bradshaw for The A Government Minister has said a controversial enrolment policy at a Church of Ireland school in Co Wicklow goes against the spirit of recent legislation aimed at protecting minority faith schools.The long-serving principal of St Patrick’s National School in Greystones announced her resignation during the summer in protest over a policy which prioritises the enrolment of children who regularly attend church services.On Friday, Minister for Health Simon Harris, who lives in Greystones, expressed his concern at developments.“An incredible school principal has tendered her resignation and many parents in the town have contacted me who are very upset about this and about changes to admissions policies at St Patrick’s,” he said.Mr Harris said he intends to write to the Department of Education as he “does not believe these changes are in line with, at the very least , the spirit and intention of recent legislation”.Under the new School Admissions Act - due to come into force inthe coming academic year - priority enrolment will no longer be given on the basis of religion in Catholic schools.However, minority faiths - such as the Church of Ireland - will be allowed to continue use religion as a factor in their enrolment policies. Minister for Education Richard Bruton said this exclusion was to ensure the ethos of such schools could be protected.This week, the school’s parent-teacher association overwhelmingly backed a no confidence vote in its board of management and chair by a margin of about 80 per cent.They also overwhelmingly backed a confidence vote in the principal by a margin of 90 per cent.A number of parents say they want either mediation in the row or a dissolution of the board.A spokeswoman for school’s patron, the united diocese of Dublin and Glendalough, did not comment when contacted by The . The chair of the school board of management, Canon David Mungavin, also declined to comment.The controversy began during the summer when principal Eileen Jackson wrote to parents to say she was resigning on foot of the school’s “new direction” in making admission to State-funded education a “collateral benefit of parochial engagement”.These priority admissions require the signature of the rector, who signs off whether the child is an active member of the parish.Board of management sources, however, say there is “no change in direction” and its policy has been in place for several years.Another source of controversy at the school has involved a decision by the board of management to turn down an extra teacher the school was entitled to for the coming academic year.Some parents claim the move was to prevent school numbers growing and potentially diluting its Church of Ireland ethos.However, sources on board of management say the move was due to concerns around whether the school had the space to cope with extra pupil numbers.Mr Harris has called for some kind of mediation to ensure that the row can be resolved.He said the school has an excellent reputation with a “brilliant school community, excellent teachers, committed and involved parents and a superb principal whose dedication, ability and enthusiasm is infectious and beyond reproach.“Clearly relations between many parents and the school authority have significantly deteriorated. I believe meaningful dialogue is urgently required and I would respectfully suggest that mediation which has been sought by many parents between all stakeholders would be beneficial,” he said.“Greystones is a wonderful community and one which is inclusive. I want to see this continue where children of different faiths grow up together and learn together.” "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Emergency services are at the scene following incident on the N18 southboundEmployees opting to leave to receive 5 weeks pay per year of service, capped at \u0026euro100,000The pair started a GoFundMe page after the man used his last dollars to help one of themAgreement must be signed by November at the latest, EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator saysPrincipal resigned over admissions rule which prioritises church-goersThe site of the famous north Dublin tavern is to be converted into a 163-bedroom hotelCouncil plans to move Travellers living on land needed for airport runway to CoolquayClean-up continues in Aughnacloy as homes and cars are covered in substanceAt least 500kg of cocaine was destined for the south coast of EnglandDavid Lyness - who court heard has fascination with knives - cut Anita Downey\u0026rsquos throatGerman-born Sean Binder (24) has lived in Ireland all his life and denies trafficking chargesJudge says Krystal Alana Anderson needs help for mental health and addiction issuesTipperary TD criticises failure of Labour Party leader \u0026lsquoto turn the ship around\u0026rsquoBody has been removed to the mortuary at University Hospital Waterford\u0026lsquoSignificant\u0026rsquo quantity of narcotic discovered on vessel off UK coast in inter-agency operationPolice say confidential documents appeared in documentary about loyalist massacreNews, views and opinions from Student Hub contributors and  writerOver 50,000 people are descending on Stradbally ahead of the boutique festivalVictim brought to hospital as garda\u0026iacute seek witnesses to Parnell Street incident"},{"url":null,"title":"how cool is dublin s newest garda station","story":"  August 30, 2018Minister insists incoming Garda chief will bring experience and expertise to force   August 30, 2018Minister thanks \u0026Oacute Cual\u0026aacutein for \u0026lsquosteady\u0026rsquo service to the State at opening of new Garda station "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3613237.1535736035!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"woman distressed after bank debt investigator made evening call to her home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichelle Fowler at home in Enniscorthy, Co Wexford. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw A separated mother of two has spoken of her distress after a man acting on behalf of Permanent TSB called to her home shortly before 9pm on a Friday night seeking information about her.Michelle Fowler (39), a special needs assistant who lives in Co Wexford, has been separated for more than five years and has two sons, aged 15 and 12. She left the family home in 2012 and a substantial mortgage and arrears remain attached to it. Ms Fowler told The  she was recently alone in her rented home when she heard banging on her sittingroom window. She thought it was a friend but when she opened the front door she found “a tall man with white hair in a tracksuit, probably in his 50s” standing outside. She said the man asked for her name and in response she asked him who he was and sought identification. “He flashed an identification card at me but wouldn’t let me hold it to look at it,” she said. “He refused to give me his name, and proceeded to ask me questions. He asked if the house I’m currently in is mine or rented. “I asked again for his name and proper identification. He refused to give his name but said his job was to find out the location of people who owe money to PTSB.”Ms Fowler said she tried to close the door but he “put his hand on the front door and pushed it in so that I couldn’t close it. He refused to leave and refused to let me close the door”.She told him her finances were being handled by the Phoenix Project, a Portlaoise-based charity helping people in mortgage distress.“He said he wanted answers to questions. Because this man would not leave, and because I was terrified, I answered the questions.” She told him she was renting the house and that she had not lived in the mortgaged property since October 2012. Ms Fowler said she asked the man not to call to her house again and said if PTSB wanted any information they could deal with the Phoenix Project. “His answer was to tell me that the bank might take my car to help pay off the money owed. He then took his foot out of the door and left.”She said she suffered from anxiety as a result of the incident. “I will now have to go back to my doctor for anxiety medication. My whole body is sore from stress, my muscles are cramped and I have palpitations, all symptoms of anxiety.” William Prior of the Phoenix Project expressed concern at how the woman had been approached. “To make contact with a woman on her own in her home in this manner at this time on a Friday evening is shocking,” he said. “There were no support services open at that hour and if she had come to harm after this visit, who would have taken responsibility.”John O’Donohoe, a solicitor who volunteers with the Phoenix Project and has represented Ms Fowler in court, noted that his client lacked the capacity to repay any residual debt owed to PTSB due to her situation. “What is the point of calling to her house on a Friday night? She has no money. Either the debt is written off or she files for bankruptcy. PTSB cannot get any money if it is not there, so what they are doing seems pointless and needlessly upsetting.” In a statement Permanent TSB said it took “allegations like this seriously” and that having “investigated this matter fully with our legal advisers and with the trace company which is the company which employs the agent who was engaged to trace the customer in question . . . we believe that these allegations are without foundation”.The spokesman said the Consumer Credit Act allows “visits and telephone calls” and stipulates that personal visits cannot be made between 9pm and 9am. “Therefore 9am-9pm visits are permitted,” he said. He said the agent who visited Ms Fowler was “a retired garda sergeant who received an Exemplary Service Record Certification upon retirement from the force and who has an unblemished record”.He said the agent’s only job was “to trace the customer – nothing more. In such situations neither the trace company nor the inidual agent who carries out the trace is informed for what purpose the trace is being made. “Neither the trace company nor the agent are given any information about the personal history of the customer they have been asked to trace. Therefore, the claim that the agent said he was tracing people who owed money to the bank does not make sense.”The spokesman said the agent in question had described his encounter with the customer as “brief, very straightforward and uneventful”. “The customer was polite and courteous and co-operative in confirming her identity and her current address,” he said.This article was amended on Friday 31st August, 2018 as an earlier version incorrectly stated Ms Fowler’s family home was sold leaving a substantial residual debt. This has now been corrected.

Photograph: Virginia MayoAPA Brexit deal must be signed by “November at the latest”, the EU’s chief negotiator has warned. Michel Barnier told a press conference in Brussels there will be no agreement unless an operational “backstop” arrangement for the Irish Border can be agreed. In the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain. But he said was “determined” to reach an agreement ahead of the October deadline, though he said there would be “flexibility” for further negotiations. Standing alongside UK Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, he said: “Week after week and step by step we are eliminating subjects, bones of contention... I’m determined, we’re going to find an agreement for an orderly withdrawal which is much better than the opposite and Dominic and I think it’s possible to reach that in October.” Mr Barnier added: “If you take account of the date chosen by the United Kingdom to leave, that’s March 29 which is in UK law and you simply count backwards the time that you need for ratification about three months here or there then it takes you to November at the latest. “It’s as simple as that.” It follows concerns that a deal may fail to materialise before the deadline. Mr Raab said that he wanted to continue “accelerating and intensifying” negotiations, adding: “We’re committed to resolving the deal by (the October council) and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach.” Earlier, Mr Barnier said a backstop is “essential to conclude the negotiations”, stating: “With no backstop there will be no agreement.” He described the issue as a “matter of some urgency”, adding that he had asked the Brexit Secretary to provide data on how the “necessary controls and checks take place”. British prime minister Theresa May has repeatedly said she will refuse to contemplate any backstop deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. The UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole. Mr Raab said the government “remained committed” to finding a solution in Northern Ireland. He said: “On Northern Ireland we remain committed to giving effect to the joint report, continuing the work on the potential solutions, working with Michel and his team on some of the issues he’s raised and continuing to drive that forward. “The solutions must be workable, they’ve got to be workable for the communities living in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic of Ireland.” Mr Barnier also told media in Brussels that the future partnership between the EU and UK would be without precedent. He said: “If we achieve what was in the March guidelines then you really do have a partnership with no precedent, this a very ambitious free trade agreement, specific agreements in all sorts of area of common interest.” Mr Barnier was later asked if he believed the Conservative Party Conference would have an impact on negotiations, he said: “I’m not going to comment on the internal political life on the UK, conferences of this party or that party. “We’re negotiating with Theresa May’s Government with Dominic Raab and his team and they’re the ones round the negotiating table.” –PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3613874.1535720995!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"clocks in dublin and belfast could be on different times after brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe European Commission will recommend that Member States stop changing the time by an hour twice a year. Photograph: Getty ImagesAfter Brexit the Republic and Northern Ireland could find themselves, for half the year, operating on different clocks one hour apart, if new proposals from the EU Commission to abolish summer-time clock switching are approved.The Commission on Friday announced that it will propose a directive to member states and the European Parliament to abolish twice-yearly clock-switching following a Europe-wide “consultation process”. The online survey saw 84 per cent of respondents saying they are in favour of putting an end to the bi-annual clock change. More than three quarters (76 per cent) of the respondents consider that changing the clock twice a year is a ‘very negative’ or ‘negative’ experience.The survey received 4.6 million responses from all 28 member states, the highest number ever in such a consultation. But two thirds of those were from Germany - some 3.7 per cent of its electorate. Ireland’s survey turnout was as little as 0.24 per cent, while in the UK it was only 0.02 per cent.Although member states have the sole prerogative to decide what time zone they are part of - there are three in the EU, with Ireland and the UK an hour back from Belgium - the Commission says that the Union collectively has the right to determine whether countries make the summertime switch within those time zones.In Ireland, should Brexit go ahead and the UK decides to keep the summertime clock change, clocks in Northern Ireland would go continue to go forward an hour on the last Sunday of March and back one hour on the last Sunday of October. Clocks in the South would remain unaltered, with both parts of the island out of step for seven months every year.Asked if the introduction of a time border to the island of Ireland is compatible with the EU’s determination in Brexit talks to avoid a hard border, a Commission spokesman would only insist that the two issues are not related.Observers suggest, however, that the requirement on the North to maintain regulatory alignment with the South in the EU’s proposed but contested backstop provision would seem to imply an obligation on the North to align with the EUIrish clocks. That would mean the North being out of step with the rest of the UK, a time border down the Irish Sea, surely anathema to the DUP.Since 1996, all Europeans have been changing their clock forward by one hour on the last Sunday of March and by one hour backward on the last Sunday of October. The purpose of EU rules was not to harmonise the time regime in the EU, the Commission says, but to address the problems, notably for the transport and logistics sectors, which arise from an uncoordinated application of clock-changes in the course of the year.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Crossrail had been expected to open in December 2018Transport for London (TfL)London\u0027s new east-west railway Crossrail will miss its December opening date and services will not begin until autumn next year, a spokesman for the project said.More time is needed to complete final infrastructure and extensive testing to ensure a safe and reliable railway is delivered, according to Crossrail Limited.Services were due to begin running by the end of the year, but the central section between Paddington and Abbey Wood will not be opened until autumn 2019.Rail minister Jo Johnson announced last month that the scheme\u0027s budget has been increased from £14.8 billion to £15.4 billion due to cost pressures.The railway is known as Crossrail during the construction phase but will become the Elizabeth line once services begin.An Elizabeth Line test train is unveiled at Bombardier Transportation in Derby, as they are developed for the Crossrail projectWhen it is fully opened, trains will run from Reading and Heathrow in the west through 13 miles of new tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east.Responding to the delay in the Crossrail project, a spokesman for London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: It\u0027s obviously disappointing that Crossrail Limited have advised that they need more time than anticipated to complete the final pieces of infrastructure, and to carry out the extensive testing required before the next phase of the Elizabeth line can open.This has been a 10-year construction project and is one of the most complex engineering schemes ever undertaken. It is essential that a safe and reliable railway operates from day one, and this has to be the top priority.When complete, the Elizabeth line will transform travel across London and the South East, with new state-of-the-art trains taking millions of people more quickly across London, providing a boost to the economy worth billions of pounds.Mark Wild, London Underground and Elizabeth line managing director, said: We will continue to work closely with Crossrail Limited as they complete the remaining railway infrastructure work and testing needed to deliver the new railway.The delayed opening is disappointing, but ensuring the Elizabeth line is safe and reliable for our customers from day one is of paramount importance.The announcement that Crossrail will not be operational until autumn next year is the latest hitch to the London engineering project. It has already proven to be a controversial project due to concerns over delays, funding and safety.There have been a number of proposals for a Crossrail-style railway since the 1940s, but it was not until July 2008 that the current scheme was given parliamentary approval.Services were originally due to begin in 2017, but a decision was made in October 2010 to push this back by 12 months.The start date of December 2018 has now been delayed until autumn 2019 as more time is needed to complete building work and safety tests.Crossrail\u0027s budget was set at £15.9 billion in 2007, but this was cut to £14.8 billion in the Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition government\u0027s Comprehensive Spending Review in 2010.In July it was announced that £600 million of additional funding was required as Crossrail Limited and Network Rail both needed more money to complete the project.Contractors working on the project were fined more than £1 million in July last year over the death of a worker and two other incidents.A joint venture of three companies, Bam, Ferrovial and Kier (BFK), pleaded guilty to three offences at Southwark Crown Court following an investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).Construction worker Rene Tkacik, 44, died after being crushed by falling wet concrete in March 2014.Two other men were injured in separate incidents within six days of one another in January 2015. The HSE said the incidents could have been prevented if simple measures had been taken.Investment in Crossrail has fuelled frustrations among people who believe regions such as the North of England are being discriminated against in terms of transport funding.Think tank IPPR North claimed earlier this year that planned transport investment in London is two-and-a-half times higher per person than in the North.The Department for Transport disputes the figures. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling sparked anger in July 2017 last year by supporting a new £30 billion Crossrail 2 north-south scheme in London days after a series of rail electrification projects in Wales, the Midlands and the North were axed or downgraded.Transport for London (TfL)Please review our commenting policyPolice should carry \u0026#39overdose kits\u0026#39 to treat addicts, crime commissioner suggestsComment: The decline of competitive sports days is a tragedy – but a lack of exercise is even worse US will \u0026#39cut all funds to UN agency for Palestinian refugees\u0026#39AI can predict how cancers will progress, scientists find Judge orders US couple to hand crowdfunding money over to homeless veteranOne in seven students pay people to write their essays, study findsRussia-backed leader of separatist east Ukraine region reportedly killed in blastBodyguard: what the BBC drama gets wrong – and right – about life as a personal protection officerTraditional phoneboxes have been taken over by drug dealers, police warn after discovery of BT \u0026#39drug\u0026#39 phoneFrance becomes first country in Europe to ban all five pesticides killing bees Theresa May assassination plotter jailed for life over bid to bomb Downing StreetFemale monkeys don\u0026#39t trust males, even when they\u0026#39re obviously rightUgandan pop star MP Bobi Wine arrested after alleged torture by authoritiesBill Clinton, Ariana Grande, and Stevie Wonder among mourners gathering for Aretha Franklin\u0026#39s funeralAlex Salmond\u0026#39s lawyers serve legal papers on SNP governmentChina to crack down on children\u0026#39s video gaming time amid fears over addictionChina battles spread of African swine fever as fifth case foundComment: Theresa May’s Focus on UK–Africa Ties Is Long OverdueAustralia unveils starfish-killing robot to protect Barrier ReefFrom scallop rows to an obesity crisis: Our readers react to this week\u0026#39s top stories We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/08/31/TELEMMGLPICT000143361918_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"one seven students pay people write essays study finds","story":"As many as one in seven university students have cheated on their degrees by paying someone else to write their essays for them, according to a new study.Increasing numbers of graduates are said to have acted dishonestly by using essay mills during the last four years.A study by Swansea University reviewed questionnaires dating back to 1978 where students were asked if they had ever paid for someone else to complete their work.The findings - covering 54,514 participants - showed a 15.7 per cent rise in the number of students who admitted cheating between 2014 and 2018.The study also noted that cheating at universities was on the increase worldwide.Essay mills are currently legal in the UK despite being outlawed elsewhere, and an active petition is calling for the Government to ban their use.They are difficult to identify as the essays are tailored for inidual subjects and appear original.Professor Phil Newton, from Swansea University, said the UK is at risk becoming a haven for those selling essays to students.He said: The UK risks becoming a country where essay mills find it easy to do business.These findings underscore the need for legislation to tackle essay mills, alongside improvements in the way students are assessed and awareness-raising of the fundamentals of academic integrity.We need to utilise assessment methods that promote learning and at the same time reduce the likelihood that contract cheating can happen.Prof Newton\u0027s study, How Common Is Commercial Contract Cheating In Higher Education And Is It Increasing?

Two other guests evacuated from the hotel have contracted a shigella infection. Following the sudden deaths of a British couple at a holiday resort in Egypt last week, two of the  guests evacuated from the hotel where the couple were staying have said they have been infected with the bacteria Shigella.They were among some 300 guests evacuated from the Steigenberger Aqua Magic hotel in Hurghada following the sudden deaths of John and Susan Cooper from Burnley, Lancashire, who died within hours of each other.Samples tested in a British lab showed that the mother and her young daughter, from the north west, were suffering from infection with the bacteria, which can be transmitted through food or water. It is believed that they caught the infection while staying at the resort. Others are also thought to have been infected.Shigella - a group of bacteria similar to E. coli -  is a highly contagious and common cause of food poisoning. The bacteria causes the infectious disease known as shigellosis.There are four different types of shigella. Shigella sonnei and shigella flexneri are the kinds more commonly found in the UK.Shigella boydii and shigella dysenteriae are more common in developing countries - cases of infection with these types of the bacteria found in the UK tend to be among travellers coming back from holiday. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 can be deadly.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most people who are infected with the bacteria develop diarrhoea, fever, and stomach cramps one to two days after they have been exposed. Mild cases of the infection usually clear up in five to seven days.Some people who are infected with shigella do not show any symptoms but they are still able to transmit the bacteria to other people.In more serious cases shigella can cause dysentery - an infection of the intestines that causes bloody or mucus-containing diarrhoea.Shigella is highly contagious and it takes just a few of the germs to make someone sick. The germs are found in the faeces of infected people while they have diarrhea and for up to two weeks after the diarrhea has gone away.The germs are spread when someone touches their mouth with hands that have been in contact with the shigella bacteria or eats food with the germ on it. You can get shigella bacteria on your hands after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated with germs from the stool of someone with the infection, eating food made by someone who has shigellosis, handling nappies of an infected child, swallowing infected water or having sexual contact with someone who is infected or is recovering from a recent infection.Shigella causes some 165 million cases of disease worldwide each year - mostly among children under five in less wealthy countries.Countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and Asia have in the past been hit by pandemic waves of the disease.2,327 laboratory-confirmed cases of shigella infection were reported in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in 2014 compared to 1,991 cases the previous year. At least 20 per cent of cases were related to travel.Confirmed cases in the UK have risen in recent years - according to Public Health England (PHE) this is most likely due to a rise in infections among gay and bisexual men. Clusters of cases have in the past also been reported in schools and day care centres - however, there is currently no warning of a general outbreak in the UK. More than one million people are estimated to die from shigella infections each year.Most cases clear up without issues but serious complications could include severe dehydration, seizures (particularly in children),  kidney failure and paralysis of the colon preventing bowel movement or passing gas which could cause the colon to rupture open if left untreated.Young children are the most likely to get shigellosis, but anyone can be infected. According to PHE, cases among adults in the UK (not just those returning from holiday) have risen in recent years and the majority of reported cases in the UK are now seen in people over the age of 16.People who go on holiday to developing countries could contract types of shigellosis that are not easily treated by antibiotics.There have also been outbreaks of shigella among gay and bisexual men who can transmit the bacteria during sex.There is still no vaccine to prevent shigella infection so practicing good hygiene is one of the main ways to help prevent the germ from spreading.According to Mayo Clinic in the US, hygiene measures you can take to prevent the bug from transferring to others include frequent and careful handwashing with soap, not preparing food for other people if you have diarrhoea, keeping children with diarrhoea home from school,  cleaning nappy changing areas after use and disposing of dirty nappies in covered, lined bins and not swallowing water from ponds, lakes or untreated pools. Severe or persistent cases of shigellosis are usually treated with antibiotics.You should pay a visit to your  GP if symptoms do not improve after a few days or are severe - for example if your or your child\u0027s diarrhea is bloody, if the diarrhoea is causing weight loss or dehydration or if it is accompanied by a fever higher than 38 C.

Since then, engineers have been working on their plan to drop two objects onto Ryugu\u0027s surface, so that it can be explored.They have now set those dates, on which the Japanese space agency will be able to learn about the rock.The first of them will fall on 21 September. Small robots will hop out of Hayabusa-2\u0026nbspand onto the asteroid\u0027s surface, exploring it and sending images back home.Then on 3 October it will drop a package called\u0026nbspMascot, built by scientists in Germany and France, that will further explore the surface.That will then be followed by two other important dates. The first will see another lander drop onto the asteroid\u0026nbsp– and the second will see the detonation of an explosive device that will allow scientists to blast a hole in the surface and explore what lies beneath.Hayabusa-2 will then make its way onto the surface to pick up all important samples. Those will then be carried back to Earth, in perhaps the most astounding part of the mission, which will allow scientists down here to study objects that have made their way through the solar system before arriving back here.The spacecraft will leave the asteroid in December 2019 and hopes to arrive back on Earth the following year.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/31/11/blackberry-key2-le-phone-release.jpg","title":"blackberry key2 le review uk price specs phone android keyboard smartphone","story":"Created with Sketch.BlackBerry Mobile describes the Key 2 LE as a \u0027vibrant, modern smartphone\u0027BlackBerry\u0026nbspmay now use Android software, but it refuses to ditch the keyboardClick to followThe Independent TechBetween 2009 and 2010,\u0026nbspevery fifth smartphone\u0026nbspsold was a Blackberry.

The challenge for TCL, beyond simply building a smarthphone, is rebuilding on a brand that was once so popular it became known as \u0027CrackBerry\u0027 – referencing the addictiveness of the devices it built.Scroll Free September: Why you should go cold turkey on social mediaThe way to do this, TCL figures, is to appeal to enterprise customer by\u0026nbspfocussing on two key areas: privacy and productivity.Today\u0027s smartphones try to offer a one size fits all solution, but that is no longer realistic when we have a global marketplace as erse as we have today, said Alain Lejeune, a senior vice president at TCL Communcation.But this is why we focues on making modern BlackBerry smartphones like Key2 LE, to stand out and deliver a great experience for everyday communication, with access to all the features, connectivity and applications our customers expect.Key2 LE comes in Slate, Champagne and Atomic colours (BlackBerry Mobile)Despite being a scaled version of the Key2, the Key2 LE features impressive specs for a phone that retails at just $399.

A 3,000mAh battery also means it has a battery life of 22 hours, though no reviews have yet emerged to confirm this.Most important for its demographic, perhaps, is the inclusion of its own custom apps and software, such as the DTEK security dashboard app and Locker, which helps users hide apps behind a security wall.Earlier this year, BlackBerry\u0026nbspMobile said it was aiming for a 3 to 5 per cent market share over the next few years, with the company saying it was heading in the right direction.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of FrestoniaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/15/06898485.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1667  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/15/06898485.jpg","title":"brexit eu barnier border ireland urgency latest october raab","story":"Created with Sketch.Michel Barnier\u0026nbspsays agreement on Northern Ireland border \u0027critical\u0027 to final Brexit dealClick to followIndy PoliticsEU says Brexit border plan now \u0027a matter of some urgency\u0027The UK must agree a backstop plan for the Northern Ireland border after Brexit\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspa matter of some urgency, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator has warned.Speaking after the latest round of negotiations,\u0026nbspMichel Barnier\u0026nbspsaid that\u0026nbspwithout a detailed plan, there will be no agreement.The sticking point relates to what should happen to the Northern Ireland border if the UK and EU are unable to reach a trade deal that would see an open border maintained.\u0026nbspSpeaking alongside\u0026nbspDominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, Mr Barnier\u0026nbspsaid: We\u0026nbspmust have a detailed backstop solution, which is legally operational, in the withdrawal agreement.The prime minister, Theresa May, committed herself to this, as have all the leaders of EU institution – the parliament for example.He added: It is\u0026nbspa matter of some urgency.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.The EU has proposed a backstop plan that would see Northern Ireland in effect remain in the customs union and single market, therefore removing the need for border checks – but the UK government says any arrangement gives the region a different status to the rest of the country is unacceptable.Instead, ministers have suggested a customs arrangement that would see the whole UK adopt the same tariffs as the EU for a time-limited period until a longer-term agreement is reached. But Brussels said this amounted to cherry-picking and has made clear it will not accept a backstop that is time-limited.The issue has become one the the main sticking points during negotiations.

We would expect any post-Brexit regime to do the same in UK.A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: Until we leave the EU, the UK Government continues to implement European regulations.LED lightbulbs tend to be more energy efficient than conventional lightbulbs, which means that when combined with other energy efficiency measures, households will save around \u0026pound100 on their annual energy bills from 2020.

Life after death: Man claims to meet JESUS in afterlife\u0026ldquoThe reference to Cana in Josephus, the New Testament and in the rabbinic texts would argue the village was a Jewish village, near the Sea of Galilee and in the region of lower Galilee.\u0026ldquoKhirbet Qana fulfills all of these criteria.As for the better-known site at Kafr Kanna, Dr McCollough is sceptical.\u0026ldquoWhen tourists visiting Israel today are taken to Cana, they are taken to Kafr Kanna, he said.\u0026ldquoHowever, this site was not recognised as a pilgrimage site for those seeking Cana until the 1700s.It\u0026rsquos the former site of Khirbet Qana, a Jewish village between the years of 323BC and AD 324 (Image: penmedia)\u0026ldquoAt this point the Franciscans were managing Christian pilgrimage and facilitating easy passage rather than historical accuracy.Dr McCollough believes the discoveries at Khirbet Qana could even bolster the case for the historicity of the Gospel of John.He said: \u0026ldquoOur excavations have shown that this was in fact a thriving Jewish village located in the heart of much of Jesus\u0026rsquos life and ministry.\u0026ldquoFor the Gospel of John, Cana is in some ways, Jesus\u0026rsquos safe place or operational centre. It is a place He and His disciples return to when they encounter resistance in Judea.\u0026ldquoI would argue our excavations warrant at least a reconsideration of the historical value of John\u0026rsquos references to Cana and Jesus.

She had been complaining for weeks of strange urges and impulses, as well as voices telling her to do things she wouldn’t usually do.Her parents, desperate to help their vulnerable daughter, believed this could be the work of the devil, so they took her to see prominent exorcist Manuel Acuña - the only man who seemed to have the cure.Manuel, known to his thousands of followers as the Padre, has exorcised hundreds of girls just like Natalia - believing that the cures to their mental health problems are religious, rather than medical.In Natalias case, the Padre, sweating profusely, spends an hour locked in combat with the devil, chanting to himself as the girls horrific screams echo around his church, in the suburbs of Argentinian capital Buenos Aires.Many of us would imagine that exorcisms dont exist outside of horror films, but the truth is that they are still relatively commonplace in some parts of the world.In Argentina, where religion plays a huge role in society, the Padre has found that there is a huge demand for exorcisms, often for vulnerable, unwell girls who need help from doctors.During the procedures, he shouts, brandishes crosses and rings bells to ward off demons, while his subjects thrash and moan - supposedly as a result of the high-energy battle between the Padre and the devil.And now the enigmatic figure, who often appears on local TV shows, has been made the subject of a new BBC3 documentary, Exorcism: The Battle for Young Minds.In the show, journalist Andrew Gold meets the Padre, who he says was clearly influenced by the big-screen depiction of exorcisms.His church was adorned with movie posters superimposing his face onto characters from the X-Files and The Exorcist, Andrew told Sun Online.But when Andrew took part in an exorcism - by ringing bells around Natalias head as she lay strapped to the ground - the sinister reality set it.When watching videos, there’s a distance that makes the exorcism process seem either paranormal or a little embarrassing, Andrew says.But to actually be in the room is something else.Initially keen to get involved, I’d taken hold of the bells that supposedly drove off the devil.But standing over Natalia, the gravity of her situation dawned on me. This was a woman at my feet who I perceived to be suffering from a serious mental illness.After the exorcism, Natalia claims that she is feeling better, and the Padre is eager to chalk her experience up as another win for his church.But when Andrew checks in with Natalia again later on, he learns that her symptoms have not improved at all.And in other cases, it appears that the Padres work can even harm the people he exorcises.That was what happened when 17-year-old Candela came to him, asking for help.When Andrew meets Candela, her mum explains that she suffers from bulimia, hears voices in her head and cuts herself.I tried to kill myself on Monday, the teenager adds, holding out her hand to reveal a lattice of red scars over her wrist.Candela has been to see doctors about this, but psychiatrists have all wanted to check Candela into their clinics.Her mother refused, and instead brought her for a consultation with the Padre, who recommended an exorcism as a solution to Candelas problems.What worried me was the thought of Candela, already in a suicidal state, being subjected to his violent methods, Andrew says.It made me wonder how many other teenagers were shunning medical advice in favour of quick-fix promises.Candelas mother watched on, desperate, during her daughters exorcism.Throughout the procedure, Candela twitches and cries, a cross resting on her chest as the Padre shouts at her and chants biblical slogans in her ears.The power burns you, he says, supposedly speaking to the devil within. The power commands you. Come out now in the name of Jesus.No, Candela shouts in response, supposedly speaking the words of Satan. She belongs to me.When the ordeal is over, Candela says she feels like a weight is off her shoulders.Smiling and relieved, she hugs her mother and says: Im free of evil. Its a big relief after two years.But when Andrew checks in with her months later, he learns that her mental state has deteriorated substantially.So why would she say she feels better in the aftermath of the terrifying ordeal?Often, just believing that something will make you better can improve your condition in the short term - and this may explain why Candela was initially pleased with her exorcism.But this boost wont last forever, and many of the young women exorcised by the padre need long-term help from medical professionals, not a few hours with cross-wielding demon-slayers.In the documentary, Andrew speaks with doctor Eduardo Garin, who is used to losing his patients to paranormal figures like the Padre.He believes that exorcism is so popular because it genuinely appears to work at first, as a catharsis.But the doctor warns: “I can only tell you as a doctor and as a scientist. It is a dangerous practice.”He adds that its effects can only ever be beneficial for a year or two, until a new psychological episode makes the patient go back to feeling like they did before.Buenos Aires is actually home to one of the highest proportions of psychologists per person, but poorer residents like Candela often dont have access to them.This, plus ingrained taboos around mental illness, have helped to fuel a booming industry for exorcists who claim to offer quick cures to serious issues.So, if exorcisms arent real, why does the Padre do it?His opponents say its all a money-making scheme.The Padre, who doesnt pay his volunteer staff, collects contributions to the church from everyone he treats or holds consultations with, and the exorcism business has elevated him to a minor celebrity in Argentina.He also offers paid-for classes about paranormal phenomena at his church, and his spiritual gift shop sells an array of goods which he has supposedly blessed - including plastic bottles of holy water.At the end of the BBC documentary, a furious Padre inexplicably flips and demands to be left alone, calling reporters snotty brats and little punks when they try to press him on the controversies surrounding his exorcisms.You got the scandal you were looking for, he rages. And you came to defraud the churchs trust.They just want Argentina to look bad. Theyre English. Theyre the enemy - they always have been. They took the Falklands.With that, the Padre storms off, without addressing any of the serious concerns.Andrew still isnt satisfied. He says: Id spent weeks watching this man in his battle to free young minds.The deeper I looked, the more I worried that teenagers were looking up to this powerful figure, instead of seeking professional advice.Having spent time with Natalia and Candela, I couldnt deny that they seemed happier after their exorcisms. I only wondered how long it would last.Exorcism: The Battle For Young Minds is available now on BBC iPlayer Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Bush administration was complicit in the 9/11 attacks.While in 2012, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office condemned Professor Falk for giving a cover endorsement to an anti-semitic book that described Jews as Nazis and which asked if “Hitler might have been right after all”.And just last year he was revealed to be part of a controversial Facebook group, The Shoah, which shared anti-Semitic images and posts.He was also blocked from making speeches at Middlesex University and the University of East London after co-authoring a report calling Israel an “apartheid regime”.Gideon Falter of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said today that the revelation was “chilling”.He said: “Whilst Britain has taken a principled stand and condemned Richard Falk numerous times, he is revered by anti-Semites and associates of terrorists.“It is chilling to think that foremost amongst those applauding this repugnant man is Jeremy Corbyn, the potential next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.“It is little wonder that Mr Corbyn has inspired such fear in British Jews such that many are now asking whether there is a future for Jews in this country.”And Euan Philipps, spokesperson for Labour Against Antisemitism said when Mr Corbyn attended the event Professor Falk had already been known to have made a string of offensive statements.“It is therefore another damning indictment of Mr Corbyn’s record on antisemitism that he felt Professor Falk was an appropriate figure to honour.He went on: “We have been told that during his career Mr Corbyn has on occasion been a reluctant associate of those promoting hatred, but this event shows him publicly celebrating a hugely troubling figure.“It makes a nonsense of claims that Mr Corbyn has spent his career opposing antisemitism, when in this instance he appears to be honouring one of its most notorious recent proponents.’A Labour Party spokesperson said: “At the time of the event, Richard A.

rare cases, bird flu can trigger some potentially fatal complications, such as pneumonia and multiple organ failure.Treatment:It is so contagious, sufferers are warned to stay at home or are treated in isolation in hospital.They are advised to rest, drink plenty of fluids and take medication to relieve the symptoms of fever and pain.Anti-viral medication may also be prescribed.The H5N1 has led to

On Monday, 6,000 far-right protesters were involved in clashes in Chemnitz in Saxony, Germany. In Italy, the right-wing League is in government with the populist Five Star movement. The far-right Sweden Democrats could hold the balance of power after elections this autumn. It is a similar story in Hungary, Austria and Slovenia. Some fear the “great peace” – the 70-plus years of co-operation and security in Western Europe – is now under threat. The rise of the far-right has co\u0026shyincided with a decline of the centre-left. Of the 28 EU states, only six – Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece, Sweden and Slovakia – have left-wing governments. The right’s tough line on migration has played well with some of the left’s traditional supporters. Prof Matthew Goodwin, of Kent University, says: “We have centre- left parties struggling with a new agenda of terrorism, immigration and the refugee crisis.” There are fears for the future of the EU. A poll for Reuters suggests far-right parties could increase their seats in the European Parliament from 80 to 122 next year. Prof Goodwin says: “The issue of the refugee crisis is massive for the EU. If they cannot be seen to respond effectively to that issue and they cannot come up with a unified plan, that is going to cause the EU major, major problems.” So what is the current situation? HUNGARY At the vanguard of the populist surge is PM Viktor Orban. In power since 2010, he has exploited unease over immigration to whip up nationalist sentiment. He casts himself as the defender of Europe against Muslim migrants, saying “a Europe with a mixed population” has “no sense of identity”.  Hungary is now described as an “illiberal democracy” due to its suppression of free speech and political cronyism. Allies of Orban, 55, have been appointed to key positions in the courts, media and civil service. In June, a law was introduced so that anyone “facilitating illegal immigration” could face prison. Another crackdown, a swipe at billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a fierce critic of Orban, aims to curtail the activities of charities and civil rights groups. Hungary has been referred to the European Court of Justice for “non-compliance” with EU law but Brussels has done little to tackle corruption in the country and allegations that billions of euros in EU funding goes to Orban’s cronies. GERMANY The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party entered parliament for the first time in last October’s elections, winning 12.6% of the vote and more than 90 seats. Preying on fears about immigration and Islam, one of its leading figures, Alexander Gauland, 77, has talked of fighting an “invasion of foreigners”. The party has also been accused of anti-Semitism.  Traditional Conservative parties have shifted to the right to head off the threat. Angela Merkel’s government almost collapsed this year when her coalition partners the Baian-based Christian Social Union demanded a tougher line on immigration. SWEDEN The Sweden Democrats, who are anti-immigration, are now polling a record high of 20 per cent. The party, which has roots in neo-Nazi organisations, is pushing an agenda of “Swexit”, halting migration and outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to beyond Europe’s borders. Its focus on crime and immigration has found appeal among voters who previously supported the centre-left Social Democrats. It could hold the balance of power after next month’s election. POLAND The right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015 and promotes a hardline nationalist and religious agenda. The Government has alarmed the EU by taking control of state media and granting itself powers to hire and fire the previously independent judiciary.  Exploiting unease about immigration, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 69, claimed that migrants could  cause “epidemics”.    The Government made it illegal to accuse the Polish state of complicity in the Holocaust, leading to accusations  that it is trying to cover  up collaboration with  the Nazis.  AUSTRIA The anti-immigration Freedom Party was given several key cabinet posts as part of a coalition deal with the majority People’s Party. Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, the Freedom Party wants a tough line on asylum seekers and immigrants. Legislation before the Austrian parliament would force asylum seekers to hand over their mobile phones and surrender cash to pay for their upkeep. Other proposals include a ban on girls aged 10 and under from wearing headscarves at school. A leading party member caused controversy by demanding a law requiring permits for kosher meat. The Government had to reassure the Jewish community the suggestion was not official policy. BRITAIN There are fears that a failure to deliver the Brexit promised by the Leave campaign could fuel far-right tensions here. UKIP has made a mini-recovery in the polls off the back of its claim that PM Theresa May is “betraying” voters with her soft Brexit. Leader Gerard Batten has taken the party further to the right with anti-Muslim \u0026shyrhetoric, calling Islam a “death cult” and talking of an “explosion” of mosques in Europe.

Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, responding to Mr Barnier\u0027s comments, said the Government remained committed to finding a solution in Northern Ireland.  He said: On Northern Ireland we remain committed to giving effect to the joint report, continuing the work on the potential solutions, working with Michel and his team on some of the issues he\u0027s raised and continuing to drive that forward. The solutions must be workable, they\u0027ve got to be workable for the communities living in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic of Ireland.  Dominic Raab met Michel Barnier in Brussels today for another round of Brexit talks. Despite his concerns Mr Barnier was optimistic about the future relationship. He told the press conference: We have I think all the necessary building bricks to build a close and effective relationship between the Union and the United Kingdom on a series of subjects which are very important for the citizens. He repeated his pledge to build a partnership without precedent with the UK after Brexit. The meeting came as Jeremy Hunt played down the chances of imminent deal, saying there is “a very long, hard road ahead.” The Foreign Secretary said people shouldn’t “read too much into” Michel Barnier’s comments earlier this week that the EU wants “a partnership with Britain such as has never been with any other third country”.

Martina said the family have been offered \u0026pound65 compensation from the travel store but are not happy and are hoping to be refunded for the holiday. She wrote: Local store say they will refund us \u0026pound65 in gift vouchers. What a joke. This will go to head office and social media so that other hard working families do not experience the same as we did. Martina claims the brochure only had photos of the four-star hotel but none of the connected two-star apartment development that they had booked.  Martina said: All you get when you book is pictures of this amazing high class hotel. I\u0027m not surprised they don\u0027t show you the apartments as when you get to them they show two stars. When the hotel is four stars. Cheek. We are a self-employed family who work hard for a holiday and to have it ruined was so upsetting. She added: Unlike employed people we don\u0027t get holiday leave so as well as feeling like we lost \u0026pound2700 on the holiday. we also lost 2 wages for the week. We would have been better off staying home for a \u0027staycation\u0027. Our youngest daughter is highly sensitive to change so it was particularly difficult for her to adjust to not one location but two. It was tricky for her.

Shocking video captured by mum Jess Appleby, 28, shows the blood-curdling moment Stewart Palmer tries to burst into her house through a side door wielding the nightmarish weapon. Her partner Dean Brown claims only his last-minute heroics saved her and her young son Archie from a grisly fate. Dean said: It shook me up for a while because he nearly got in the kitchen. If I hadn\u0027t have kicked him and shut the door he would have cut us all up with that chainsaw.  I had to look after her and her son. I did what I had to do. In a series of three videos - shot by Jess and a neighbour - the confrontation quickly escalates from an argument in her front garden to a full-blown fist fight in the street of their Barnsley estate. Footage shows bald thug Palmer - wearing an Ellesse zip-up top - approaching the woman\u0027s window as a child shouts you just spat at me from inside. The young mum and model charges out of the house through a side gate to confront him, repeatedly saying get off my property as she tries to push him away. Dean then comes out and the two men begin fighting.  But suddenly the camera drops as another woman rushes in and the two start to scrap. Footage filmed by the next-door neighbour shows the fracas unfolding, with the two women trading blows whilst witnesses egg them on and children in the background are heard crying. Others run in to break it up but struggle to separate the two duelling women, and soon the two men start fighting again. Eventually the situation begins to calm down but the four feisty sluggers continue to exchange accusations over the garden fence. At this point, Palmer walks away, but another clip shows him charging up to the house with a roaring chainsaw before the video cuts out.

Following a spike in interest caused by the BBC show, Visit Cornwall tourism board has had to step in to tackle overcrowding during the summer.  But Cornwall Live reports that one mum was far from impressed with her trip.  The tired parent, who nicknamed herself \u0027TimeToGoHomeNow\u0027, took to Mumsnet shortly before 4am on Monday. She writes: Currently being battered by the wind in a tent in Cornwall at 3:30am so I accept that I may be being a bit unreasonable here but...  Am I being unreasonable [AIBU] to be so disappointed in how our holiday is turning out? After months of sweating away at work in the heat, we come away on our first camping trip as a family and apart from one day, the weather has been utterly rubbish for the last eight days. Camping is not the fun holiday I remember it being... Trudging through the mud to go to the toilet in a portacabin, air beds that keep deflating, showers that are not much more than dripping taps, neighbours who talk loudly into the night... Not as fun as I remember it being pre-children. Dear daughter\u0027s behaviour has been a nightmare in comparison to at home and I feel like all we\u0027ve done is have a go at her. I suppose she\u0027s only four and excited but things like running off or not listening in potentially dangerous situations can\u0027t be tolerated. That\u0027s not been any fun. Cornwall... A beautiful county but my god the crowds. I knew it would be busy with it being August  but literally everywhere we\u0027ve tried to visit has been a complete ball ache to try to get parked.  Some places we\u0027ve just had to drive through as there was no chance of stopping. Where we\u0027re staying there\u0027s no public transport we could easily use. The traffic is terrible! The supermarkets where we are are like scenes from an apocalypse film. How the locals cope living down here I do not know. I know I\u0027m just being a miserable so and so and I realise how lucky we are to be in a situation where we can  afford a family holiday but AIBU to be so disappointed? We\u0027ve got four nights left and I just feel like packing up and going home! Please tell me in years to come I\u0027ll look back on this holiday with fond memories and not lament about the time we spent probably as much as we would have going abroad to stay in a wet, miserable, busy place in a tent!

The couple were being interviewed by reporter Angela Rippon, the night before their Royal Wedding in 1981. Broadcast on Thames Television, the clip shows Rippon question Charles and Diana on coping with the strains of royal life and how the Princess-to-be might adapt to her new life. Charles says: In the end you do get used to it, before turning to Diana, 20 when she married into the royal family, to ask her whether she feels the same. He adds: Do you find in the last six months you are beginning to get used to it?  Diana, who sits with her chin slumped into her hand - a sign of boredom according to body language experts, then says Charles has been a tower of strength during her time adjusting to royal life. The pair laugh, before she adds: I have to say that because you are sitting there, directing the witty comment to Charles. In response, Charles can be seen gesturing his head in an upward nod, before appearing to roll his eyes back. Body language expert Judi James said Charles\u0027s response to his fianc\u0026eacutee\u0027s words was peculiar and the footage shows signals of incompatibility.  She said: This interview is littered with signals of incompatibility and emphatic anxiety rituals from Charles that seem to increase in front of our eyes. Diana\u0027s trait of sitting with her chin sunk into her hand suggests she was hoping to be seen as dreamily romantic but it was also a gesture associated with boredom. In contrast Charles sits upright and tense with his hands fiddling and picking in a self-comfort ritual that suggests agitation.

While the princes have had a packed summer of public and private events, including a monumental royal wedding for Harry and Meghan Markle, Kensington Palace scheduled no engagements for them today. It\u0027s believed the princes, 15 and 12 when they lost their mother, will be spending the day with their wives and wider families.  A Kensington Palace spokeswoman told the Express : “There is no official engagement planned and we don’t have a comment on what the family would be doing.”  Last year, the princes also stayed out of the public eye on the same day, spending it in private with family.  But, on the eve of the 20 year anniversary, Harry, 33, and William, 37, visited the White Garden, a memorial dedicated to Diana in the grounds of Kensington Palace. Despite the huge impact she made on the world, barely any commemorations were planned for the actual day. The bells of Westminster Abbey fell silent and there was no gun salutes to mark the occasion. Diana died on August 31, 1997, in a horrific car accident at the entrance of the Pont de l\u0027Ama tunnel, near Malar fire station in Paris The car was speeding through the tunnel in the early hours of the morning when it crashed into a pillar at 65mph. Henri Paul, the driver, lost control on the dual-carriageway.  Diana, Dodi, son of Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Al-Fayed, and driver Henri Paul, all died in the late-night crash. The Princess\u0027 bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones survived. Reports at the time claimed Diana was travelling to an apartment in Rue Ars\u0026egravene Houssaye without wearing a seat belt. The news sent shockwaves across the word sending the UK into mourning.  The effects though were felt around the world and news channels all reported the events well into the morning and weeks afterwards.  It took six months of claims and counter-claims from more than 250 witnesses to settle what happened.

In the infamous interview with Martin Bashir on the BBC\u0027s Panorama in 1995, the People\u0027s Princess explained to the world why she thought would never be Queen - and it was all to do with what the Royal Family\u0027s perception of her. When Bashir asked her Do you think you will ever be Queen?, she quickly replied no, I don\u0027t, no. She added: I\u0027d like to be a queen of people\u0027s hearts, in people\u0027s hearts, but I don\u0027t see myself being Queen of this country.    I don\u0027t think many people will want me to be Queen. She continued to say that by people she really means the establishment she married into and feels they decided that she was a non-starter. When asked why this was the case, Diana went on to say that she believes her problems with the Royal Family were because I do things differently and doesn\u0027t go by a rulebook as she leads with her heart and not her head. She added that she thought she didn\u0027t have supporters in the Royal household for a bizarre reason: They see me as a threat of some kind.  Diana said to Bashir that she feels every strong woman in history faces this reaction, because their strength inspires confusion and fear.  The enlightening in-depth interview covered a lot of ground on some very important topics. This is what the Princess had to say on some of them. What Diana said about her marriage At the time of the interview, Diana and Charles had been separated for nearly three years. The pair married in 1981 when she was just 19 years old. She told Bashir that she may have felt daunted by the pressures of marrying into the family at the time, she still felt she had the support of her husband-to-be.  She said that she desperately wanted it to work and desperately loved my husband but when Charles asked for a separation she accepted. This was the interview where she famously said of Camilla Parker-Bowles : There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded. What Diana said about mental health In the BBC interview, Diana was very candid about her difficulties with her mental health - saying that she struggled with postnatal depression and bulimia which she described as a secret disease.

Kelly McMillan, 38, had the circular solid steel frame made ahead of her big day earlier this month.   It is made of four rows of metal holders which hold dozens of wine glasses, whether it is for Prosecco, red, white or rose.  Now Kelly is going to lend the dress to another lucky bride for a dream one-off experience for \u0026pound100.

Kelly, a hair salon owner from Pilton, Edinburgh, had the bespoke dress made by blacksmith David Wright, 48, for her wedding reception three weeks ago. She was presented with the 30-kilogram frame as a wedding present at The Village Hotel at Crewe Toll, Edinburgh. The frame is designed to mimic the shape of a ballgown wedding dress, giving the bride plenty of space to move around in while chatting to guests. Kelly said: I own a hair salon, and one of my customers saw a similar dress online and said \u0027that is absolutely perfect for you\u0027 and I agreed. I went to David, who is a blacksmith, and asked him if he could make one - and he said \u0027I don\u0027t know\u0027.  Then, he brought it along on the day as a wedding present. It was fantastic, it\u0027s much more personal than just sticking a table full of Prosecco and letting guests grab one. You just stand in it while they grab a glass and you can speak to them. I asked the hotel if they wanted to keep it, but they didn\u0027t have the space. And I didn\u0027t want to leave it behind or just having it sitting in the house.

Residents of Birmingham are most likely to feel unsafe walking their streets at night – while Edinburgh is deemed the safest city in the UK, according to new research. A staggering 42 per cent of those living in the midlands city feel at risk even during the day, while a third worry even when they are in their own home. And half wouldn’t dream of going out after dark. In comparison, nearly 90 per cent of people in Edinburgh feel safe, with just 16 per cent experiencing crime.  The statistics emerged in a study to mark the launch of new true crime docu-series called Murdertown on Crime + Investigation, which also found only two thirds would recommend their town or city as a safe place to live. A spokesperson for Crime + Investigation added: “The results of this study offer a fascinating insight into how safe we Britons feel in our cities and towns.\u0027\u0027 It also emerged just 56 per cent of those living in Birmingham would recommend their home as somewhere safe to live compared to 82 per cent of Edinburgh residents. Researchers found Bristol also appeared among the top five safest cities, closely followed by Brighton and Hove, with Southampton and Cambridge completing the top five. Leicester took second place for the cities residents feel the least safe in, followed by Manchester, London and Sheffield.  The study polling 2,000 Brits revealed 31 per cent have felt unsafe in their own home at one point or another, with nearly a quarter hearing of break-ins or attacks in their local area. Just under half of those polled have known a victim of crime, with a home break-in being the most commonly experienced offence. More than a third know someone who have been the target of car theft and nearly a quarter are acquainted with someone who has been mugged. It also emerged nearly a quarter have been a victim of crime themselves in the town or city they live in, but say more could be done to make them feel more at ease.  Half would like to see police patrolling the streets more often to make them feel safer, and a third said more CCTV would help ease their worries. And three in ten agreed additional street lights would make the difference. Brits have felt so anxious, nearly a quarter have either moved or considered a move to an entirely different town or city in a bid to feel safer.

Jamie Carr reached speeds of 100mph in a stolen car during a police chases, stole \u0026pound10,000 from a man\u0027s house, spray-painted swastikas on cars and was the subject of two rooftop sieges during a frenzied crime spree.   Liverpool Echo reports the 20-year-old dad was charged for a burglary in connection with taking eight cars from a showroom, but this charge was later dropped.  This week, Carr was given an 18-month immediate jail sentence for his crimes. But Judge Clement Goldstone QC said he could not punish Carr further because of restrictions in the law.  Carr, a labourer, appeared at Liverpool Crown Court to admit six counts of taking vehicles without consent, handling stolen goods, theft and possessing an offensive weapon. He is already serving a sentence for previous offences, which is due to end in March 2019. He will now serve his 18-month sentence concurrently with the one is already serving. Because of this, Judge Goldstone QC said he will effectively get the majority of an 18-month jail term \u0027for free\u0027.  He said: You are 20. You have had ample opportunity to mend your ways and you have chosen not to take them. Because you have been recalled to serve the remainder of your sentence, you will have to start to serve your sentence for these offences now, instead of at the conclusion of the sentence for which you have been recalled. I do not make the law, but I have to apply it. You are therefore fortunate not to be starting your sentence at the end of your current sentence, but instead of that, you will start to serve it now. The father was banned from the road for two years and nine months.  Carr, of Anfield, Liverpool, led police on a chase along dual-carriageways in May. He sped through red lights at 100mph in a stolen Audi A1, bursting both front tyres as it careered over the central reservation. Then its occupants fled. Four days later Carr was behind the wheel of a Skoda Fabia also stolen in the showroom burglary. He drove at up to 70mph in 30mph residential areas, bounced over speed bumps and turned off the car\u0027s lights in a bid to evade capture.

Laura Greeves, 26, started losing her sight at 24 when, in just a matter of days, she began to see black spots and her vision became blurred. She met Alex Lucas, 25, at a support group after learning she had also lost her sight overnight at just 23-years-old and was also left without a reason for her loss of sight. The pair have now gone on to inspire others with YouTube tutorials and even run a weekly podcast, called Suddenly Sightless, to help other blind and partially sighted people.  Doctors were unable to explain the sudden deterioration of mum-of-one Laura\u0027s eyesight, which left her unable to work and drive, and she was forced to bring forward her wedding to husband, David, after fears she wouldn\u0027t be able to see him on her big day. The former administrator from Selly Oak, Birmingham, said: I had to accept that I was never going to know why I had lost my sight and also my independence. It felt like I was grieving, I couldn\u0027t even play games with my son, Archie.  I met Alex at a working aid forum back in April and we hit it off straight away. We both wanted a way to connect to as many people as possible as we didn\u0027t know many people our age in this situation. Alex, a former make-up artist, from Northfield, Birmingham, said: I lost my eyesight in a very similar way and I think it brought us both together.  I had been suffering from headaches but woke up one morning to find my vision was blurred, it was like there was a white mist in the room. I was told that I had optic nerve damage but with no explanation as to why and no cure. I remember just going home and crying int he shower. Meeting Laura meant I had a friend I could talk to, who was going through the same thing. We started bouncing ideas off one another and it became an outlet for us.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed. The shops at the Victorian Market shut at 5pm. Staying open later and having maybe street entertainers there in the evening could attract more people.Friday 31 Aug 2018 6:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04106000/04106341.jpg","title":"Dont miss chance to nominate a hero","story":"TIME is running out to nominate someone you know to be one of this year\u0027s Highland Heroes.The awards, organised by SPP Media and now in their second year, celebrate people in the Highlands who make a real difference to our communities, healthcare, education, safety and wellbeing.Readers are being invited to nominate people in any of the 12 categories: primary pupil, secondary pupil, primary teacher, secondary teacher, carer, fundraiser, volunteer, community champion, brave child, health professional, emergency services or armed forces hero and public servant.The deadline for nominations is midnight tomorrow.SPP Media\u0027s editorial director David Bourn said: \"This is a last call for you to tell us about the real heroes who go above and beyond to make your community, workplace or school a special place.\"Highland Heroes wants to celebrate the contribution people in our area make to the lives of others by giving them the recognition they deserve.\"So if you know a Highland Hero, now is the time to share their story.\"To nominate somebody for the awards, visit www.surveymonkey/r/HighlandHeroes2018 or email heroes@spp-group with your name, address, email and phone number, along with the person you are nominating, up to 200 words to explain why, and their contact details.After the deadline closes, a judging panel will draw up a shortlist in each category before readers are given the opportunity to vote for their favourites in a special supplement we will publish in September.The winners of each category, along with an overall hero, will be announced at a ceremony at the Kingsmills Hotel in Inverness on Thursday, November 8.The awards are sponsored by Inverness Airport.* Click here to read more about Highland Heroes.Friday 31 Aug 2018 6:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117241.jpg","title":"Drawings recall old Inverness streetscapes","story":"\u0026nbspAN intriguing glimpse into how an Inverness street looked almost 100 years ago is being showcased in a new exhibition.Intricate line drawings of buildings in Academy Street have gone on show at the city\u0027 museum and art gallery.They have been created following painstaking research by civil engineer Gordon Lynn who has sifted through old photographs and documents held by places such as the Highland Archive Centre, the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments in Edinburgh and High Life Highland\u0027 Am Baile collection.The exhibition is being held as part of the Inverness Townscape Heritage Project, which aims to regenerate the Academy Street area.

I haven’t been able to do that in the past.“I started off well in pre-season and at the start of the season and he said to me that I was ready for first-team football and that Aberdeen was a great place for me.“Personally for me Frank Lampard has had a massive impact and I think all the lads at Derby will say the same.“He’s been second to none in terms of tactics and intelligence of the game.“On the first day of pre-season you pick up little things which explain why he’s played at the top and achieved what he has in his career.“He hasn’t just taken an interest in me. A lot of the young lads at Derby have taken a big stride under him in pre-season and have ended up playing games this season.“It shows if you’re good enough you will play and he gives you the confidence to make you feel at ease in the big games.”Another major factor in Lowe’s decision to join the Reds was Lampard’s assistant at Pride Park, Jody Morris.Morris played under Dons boss Derek McInnes for four years at St Johnstone and then Bristol City and also played with McInnes at Millwall.Lowe revealed speaking to Morris and then McInnes also helped to convince him moving to the Granite City was right for him.He added: “There were a lot of reasons to come to Aberdeen.“The gaffer  spoke to me and what he said to me and his belief in my game gave me the confidence to believe I could come away from home and play in Scottish football.“Jody Morris  has worked with the gaffer and he spoke really highly of him.“Jody said he’s a great gaffer and that I’ll learn a lot under him.“And I could tell just by training that I will, so hopefully over the next six months I will keep learning.“This could be a launchpad for me because I’ve played games in the Championship.“But I need to kick on and I feel like Aberdeen is the place to do that.“They did well last year and hopefully we can kick on.”Lowe also outlined what the Red Army can expect from him during his time with Aberdeen.He said: “They can expect me to be athletic and get up and down that left side and whip balls in.“I’ll be aggressive, on the front foot and I’ll show that I want to play for Aberdeen with my passion.”Lowe could make his Dons debut against Kilmarnock tomorrow.He said: “I don’t know much about them.

operational committee, said: “The Scottish Government has said that education is their top priority – however, for a number of years now we have seen a huge shortage of teachers in Aberdeen.“Thankfully the council has brought in measures to try and combat teacher shortages through ious initiatives.“Despite being the lowest-funded council in Scotland, this administration has tried to mitigate against teacher shortages by investing in 60 new pupil support assistants.”The Inverurie Community Campus is one of the biggest school construction projects in the country.Once complete, it will be home to Inverurie Academy and St Andrew’s School, and will include community sports and leisure facilities such as a six-lane swimming pool, multi-use games area and two all-weather pitches.The new building will be operational in March 2020, and the overall project completed by spring 2021.Mr Swinney said the “topping-out” ceremony marked a “great and bold day” for the town, adding it would add to the creation of “really outstanding leisure and education facilities” for the community.\u0026nbspProvost of Aberdeenshire Bill Howatson said he was “delighted” to welcome Mr Swinney to the facility.He added: “Our aim is to provide community spaces and to help our children and young people have the brightest possible future.“This will improve opportunities for everyone, and it is a demonstration of Aberdeenshire Council’s commitment to investing in Inverurie maintaining what makes this a great place to live and work in through the construction of modern

shop raider who threatened an Aberdeen shopkeeper and stole seven jars of coffee fractured his skull after being rugby tackled by a passer-by as he fled.Michael Rae went into Bridge Street News in Aberdeen city centre with a knife on Boxing Day last year and swiped a coffee jar in full view of staff member Shihab Yahia Arabi.Mr Arabi approached the 43-year-old and told him to put the coffee back or pay for it.He then followed Rae around the shop to make sure he would not try to steal anything else, Aberdeen Sheriff Court heard.An argument then broke out between the two men and Rae held up his arm to show Mr Arabi he had a knife concealed up his sleeve.Shocked, Mr Arabi retreated, went behind the shop counter and called the police.The court heard how Mr Arabi “is a big-built man” who would have been “well able to deal” with Rae, of Deansloch Terrace, Northfield, had the pair come to blows but Mr Arabi did the right thing by instead alerting police.Rae grabbed seven jars of coffee and ran out of the shop, Sheriff Jack Brown was told.However his attempt to flee was cut short. Seconds after Rae left the store, a bystander who had seen part of the robbery rugby tackled Rae to the ground. The force of the tackle caused Rae to hit his head on the pavement and he suffered a fractured skull.Following his recovery in hospital, Rae was charged with assault and robbery – charges he admitted at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.At a hearing on Wednesday, the court heard Rae “had no recollection of what had happened, though he accepts that his intention was to steal from the shop”.The court accepted that, while Rae had the knife, he did not brandish it, or threaten Mr Arabi with it during the robbery, though he “uttered threatening remarks” and “presented the knife”.The court heard Rae has a drug problem and was willing to co-operate with any training programme.Sheriff Brown said: “Usually, in cases that come before me where someone has a knife during a confrontation, the perpetrator should be taken to prison. As far as this case is concerned, 13 months in custody would be correct.“However, I’m prepared to defer sentence while we look at the possibility of a Drug Treatment and Testing Order .“That is an intensive course which you must comply with.“It goes without saying that if you do not comply with the DTTO, you will be going to prison.”Rae was told to reappear at the court on October 3.After the hearing, the shop’s manager, Reeha Khan, told the Evening Express: “I am glad the court has given this man another chance.“He cannot remember what happened because he was under the influence of something and there was no damage to the shop.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"west enjoying view from top","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAfter bagging four goals in midweek, Willie West is hoping to do his bit again tomorrow to keep Fraserburgh top of the Highland League.The Broch beat Deveronvale 5-1 on Wednesday night to stay top of the table on goal difference ahead of Cove and Brora.Next up for the Buchan outfit is Wick Academy at Bellslea tomorrow and after netting four in midweek West is hoping Fraserburgh can beat the Scorries and stay at the summit.The 30-year-old said: “Cove have a game in hand and they are the team in form.“But for us it’s pleasing to be up there and now we’re up there we want to stay there for as long as we can. We spent some time up there last season, but Cove, with their cup involvement, they had more games.“There might be a lag where we’ve played one or two more this season but we need to take advantage of that and keep it going.“Although it’s only goal difference, it’s nice to look at the table and see yourself top, and we want to stay there on Saturday.“We always get a tough game against Wick, they’ve got some of the best players in the league in their side.“On their day they can beat the best teams and they showed that a couple of weeks ago by beating Formartine.“It will be a really tough game but we need to try to keep this momentum going by getting three points.”West returned to a starting role in Banff after spending some time on the bench. Prior to that he also missed a couple of games due a groin niggle.He says the rest did him good but maintains that even if he is absent from the team Fraserburgh are still a formidable outfit due to the strength in depth of Mark Cowie’s squad.West added: “The break did me good. I still haven’t got rid of it, I just need to manage it.“It’s something that restricts me at times and gives me pain, but it’s getting older – it’s harder to shake off these little niggles.“But we’re lucky the squad is strong and it means I might not even play on Saturday because we have other people to come in.“Mark Cowie has got a bit of a selection headache with the options he’s got.”West was delighted with his four goals from midfield against Vale and said: “I was in the right place at the right time, really. It was a couple of runs into the box and it came to me.“Two of my goals were on my weaker, right foot and it was pleasing they just seemed to go into the corners.“My shooting wasn’t very good in the warm-up but the main thing is, it’s good in the game.“Then I got two headers: one from a corner and one from a good cross.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"merger-of-prestonpans-schools-proposed","story":"  East Lothian Council launches a public consultation exercise on Monday where members of the public are asked for their thoughts on the potential move.  If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"call-for-new-state-energy-company-to-be-based-at-cockenzie","story":"  Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council is preparing to publish a document outlining its views for the future use of the site, which supports the vision put forward in a masterplan produced following public consultation.  And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"cheese-sold-in-east-lothian-recalled-after-salmonella-found","story":"  L\u0026rsquoEARL Mounier of France is recalling some batches of its Cheese AOP Pelardon after finding traces of the bacteria in the product.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.

Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.

Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level. It is an honour that we have been shortlisted as one of eight finalists in this category."},{"url":null,"title":"aberlady-street-to-be-without-power-for-most-of-the-day","story":"  Scottish Power is carrying out work on the village\u0026rsquos Kirk Road, with work to take place until 6pm.

A planning application has been lodged with the local authority for \u0026ldquoalterations, extension to redundant water tank to form one house and associated works.  A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.  It is proposed that the upper floor will contain an entrance hall, family  shower room, three bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen/dining room and sitting room, as well as stairs to the ground floor. On the ground floor, there will be a guest bedroom, family shower room, access to the cellar and garage and a drawing room.  The plans have been submitted by agent Tom Pyemont of Hawick-based firm Pyemont Design greenarchitecture on behalf of applicants James Barbour and Alex Dale.  However, when they were discussed by members of North Berwick Community Council earlier this month, members felt that they did not have enough information to make any detailed comment on the planning application.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

It comes after years of preliminary inquiries.  Soldiers have long been held responsible for killing 10 people in Ballymurphy but the accepted narrative became clouded earlier this year when former UVF members came forward to claim their organisation was also involved.  An 11th victim died after suffering a heart attack.  Earlier this month, the Ministry of Defence handed over a database of almost 5,000 names of former soldiers to the Coroner\u0026rsquos Office.  The spreadsheet is believed to contain 4,773 entries of individuals from the Parachute Regiment, Queen\u0026rsquos Regiment and Queen\u0026rsquos Division who had been serving at the time of the shootings.  The Coroner\u0026rsquos Office had been attempting to trace former soldiers who may have been at Ballymurphy during the shootings to call as witnesses to the inquest.  Padraig O Muirigh, a solicitor who acts for many of the families, said the development has come at the 11th hour.  \u0026ldquoWe have been informed by the Coroner\u0026rsquos Office that the MoD has discovered a database of almost 5,000 soldiers who potentially could be involved at Ballymurphy, he said.  \u0026ldquoThe families are very angry, very concerned at the disclosure of this information.  \u0026ldquoThey have waited 47 years for this .  \u0026ldquoThe MoD had been requested to provide information about soldiers on many, many occasions and failed to produce adequate information.  \u0026ldquoThe concern is that this will have an impact on the commencement of this inquest and they take a very cynical view of this disclosure.  John Taggart, whose father Daniel, 44, was killed, has accused the MoD of trying to delay the inquest.  \u0026ldquoIn 2011, the MoD released a statement saying they would fully co-operate with the Ballymurphy inquest, he said.  \u0026ldquoThat was a lie, and this database is a stalling tactic.  \u0026ldquoThe families are angry, disgusted and devastated.  \u0026ldquoIn six working days our inquest was meant to start, all of a sudden you have this.  \u0026ldquoThe MoD have tried to swamp the Coroner\u0026rsquos Office with new information in a dirty tactic to try and prevent us from having our inquest.  \u0026ldquoWe have fought hard, done a lot of work for our inquest. Everyone was ready to go.  \u0026ldquoThis has been created to stop and delay our inquest.  \u0026ldquoWe have fought for 47 years, we are angry and we are not going away.  Another preliminary hearing in the inquest is due to take place next week.  A Catholic priest and a mother-of-eight were among those killed during three days of gunfire involving members of the Parachute Regiment in August 1971.  Another man died of a heart attack following an alleged violent confrontation with the troops in the west Belfast estate.  The shootings took place as the Army moved in to republican strongholds to arrest IRA suspects in the wake of the introduction by the Stormont administration of the controversial policy of internment without trial.  A MoD spokesman said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoFollowing a request from the Coroner, we have provided information which may help with the inquest\u0026rsquos proceedings.  \u0026ldquoWe continue to support the Coroner\u0026rsquos intention to start the inquest on September 10 and reject the suggestion that we\u0026rsquore looking to delay proceedings."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8493314.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-steps-up-efforts-to-help-city-centre-recover-after-blaze","story":"  The front section of the historic Bank Buildings was destroyed in a blaze on Tuesday which took firefighters days to extinguish.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/143149.jpg?type=article-full","title":"port-giant-accused-of-sacrificing-clyde-to-save-mersey","story":"  Peel Ports \u0026ndash which owns and manages swathes of land along the West Coast \u0026ndash have always denied favouring their substantial holdings in England.  Now a campaign questioning the concern\u0026rsquos monopoly over both the Clyde and the Mersey has been endorsed by politicians from the SNP, Labour and Green parties.  Campaigners allege Peel Ports are letting key pieces of infrastructure lie idle that could help Scotland compete for shipyard and port jobs with north-west England.  Peel Ports dismiss this claim and point to investments approaching \u0026pound900m on the Clyde in the last two decades.  The row comes amid a long-standing conflict between two multi-millionaire tax exiles over one of the biggest marine assets on the British coast: Inchgreen Dry Dock in Inverclyde.  Three years ago this newspaper revealed one tycoon \u0026ndash Jim McColl of Ferguson Marine, Scotland\u0026rsquos last commercial shipbuilder\u0026ndash wanted to lease the 1000ft long facility from another, John Whittaker of Peel Ports.  The Save the Inchgreen Campaign, in a letter sent yesterday to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs and MSPs across Western Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe Inchgreen Dry Dock is being sacrificed to protect The Peel Group\u0026rsquos Investments on Merseyside.  \u0026ldquoThe Peel Group acquired vast areas of industrial land from Glasgow to Ayrshire when they bought Clydeport in 2002. They are now cashing in on that purchase by building thousands of houses and major retail  complexes, but no industrial development. We question whether this breaks monopoly rules.  The letter was endorsed by MPs and MSPs from the SNP, Labour and Green parties and by the\u0026nbsp  STUC, including local Inverclyde nationalists Stuart McMillan and Ronnie Cowan.  Glasgow North-East Labour MP and former shipbuilder Paul Sweeney has long championed a major world-class shipyard at Inchgreen, which would cost at least \u0026pound200m to build from scratch.  Jim McColl  Mr McColl\u0026rsquos yard, Ferguson Marine in nearby Port Glasgow, is currently struggling with a Scottish Government order for two new high-tech ferries for CalMac.\u0026nbsp  The tycoon had wanted to move to the roomier Inchgreen but failed to come to agreement with Peel Ports, which now runs the facility through its Mersey shipyard, Cammell Laird.\u0026nbsp  Critics say Peel Ports and Cammell Laird have had a decade and a half to outline long-term plans for\u0026nbsp  Inchgreen and other potential shipyard and harbour sites.\u0026nbsp  The concern has been piling money into the Clyde \u0026ndash but mostly on housing schemes such as Glasgow Harbour.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  Now, aware of simmering discontent, it has announced that it will bid for the right to turn Inchgreen into a repair yard for the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos two giant aircraft carriers.  Ferguson Marine  That, the firm says, will mean jobs. Insiders expect a charm campaign to get Clydeside politicians on side.\u0026nbsp  Save Inchgreen\u0026rsquos Robert Buirds has also highlighted other opportunities on the Clyde for ship repairs, including central Glasgow\u0026rsquos historic graving docks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  A spokesman for Peel said: \u0026ldquoWe wrote to Mr Buirds a few months ago detailing how the \u0026pound874 million Peel has invested in Scotland over the past decade has helped create more than 5,400 Scottish jobs.  \u0026ldquoMr Buirds chooses to ignore that we are actively bidding for the refit work for the new Royal Navy carriers and have pledged that, if successful, this would be located at the Inchgreen Dry Dock.  \u0026ldquoThat would\u0026nbsp create significant numbers of local, skilled manufacturing jobs. Peel has a proud track record of investment on the Clyde, from the \u0026pound200m Glasgow Harbour\u0026nbsp  development and the major redevelopment work at Greenock Ocean Terminal, which was voted the top mainland UK cruise destination, to our plans for the Hunterston Deep Water Terminal and the creation of new ports and visitors facilities at Ardrossan Harbour.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoWe remain committed to working\u0026nbsp to ensure that the Clyde plays its rightful role in the economic future of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"paul-sweeney-make-clyde-shipbuilding-great-again","story":"  But nearby underutilised infrastructure such as Inchgreen Dry Dock and Hunterston offer huge potential for the Clyde to expand towards large-scale shipbuilding as seen in Finland, France, Italy and Germany \u0026ndash which between them build around 90 per cent of the world\u0026rsquos complex cruise ships \u0026ndash and where average wages are actually higher than in the UK.  Those countries have succeeded in this competitive market because they viewed it as a long-term national industrial objective to patiently support investment in infrastructure and skills and they have captured the world market in the process.  Ferguson Marine is the country\u0026rsquos only remaining player in what is one of the most competitive and capital-intensive heavy industries in the world.  From dominating world shipbuilding a century ago, when the Clyde alone built more tonnage than the whole of Germany, the river today accounts for less than1% of global tonnage.  The success of the Port Glasgow shipyard is therefore critical as it is a platform from which to rebuild the country\u0026rsquos global market share and form the basis of a renaissance in commercial shipbuilding.  The two new dual fuel ferries under construction there for CalMac are crucial to this objective. The delays encountered by the yard during their construction are not unexpected due to the complexities of re-scaling the industry from near extinction just four years ago, but also because of design changes made by the customer, which have added to the cost.  In a feast and famine industry like shipbuilding, the competing pressures of maturing the ship\u0026rsquos design but also of keeping the workforce on the shop floor gainfully employed can be a difficult balancing act for shipyard managers, especially when scaling up the yard\u0026rsquos workforce from almost scratch and building what is essentially a working prototype.  Delays by the Scottish Government in signing the contract initially also added to costs, as the integrated propulsion system has been designed, manufactured and imported and has been subject to unfavourable currency fluctuations.  If we are to commit to a credible and sustainable commercial shipbuilding industry in this country, then the Scottish Government must accept that there will be risks of delays and snags as we re-learn the complex operation of large-scale shipbuilding and work collaboratively with our industry to learn those lessons.  Public sector contracts like the new CalMac ferries are an excellent way for the industry to develop the necessary resilience and efficiency in design, build, testing and commissioning vessels of this size so that it can then tender competitively around the world for contracts in the future.  The Germans Finns and Italians have shown the way. We need to do the same. We have done it before and we must now view this project at Ferguson Marine as a national mission to reinvigorate commercial shipbuilding and associated industries in Scotland.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries.

Mr Salmond has been heavily criticised over his decision to crowdfund his legal fight with the Scottish Government, with opposition parties accusing him of \u0026ldquoabusing his power, and dragging Scotland into the gutter.  Ms Sturgeon stressed there was an \u0026ldquoobligation not to discourage women from raising complaints.  She told the BBC: \u0026ldquoWhatever any of us do and say in the context of this very high profile case, we must absolutely make sure we don\u0026rsquot make it harder for \u0026ndash or discourage \u0026ndash women from coming forward in the future.  \u0026ldquoI think that\u0026rsquos an obligation on all of us right now. And what we should be focusing on is that fairness of process that is now important to all concerned.  Mr Salmond announced he was resigning from the SNP last night, insisting he wanted to avoid splitting the party.  He has been a member of the SNP for 45 years and its leader for 20, taking it to its greatest electoral heights and closer than ever to realising its goal of independence.  His crowdfunding appeal was set up to cover the costs of taking the Scottish Government to court to challenge its handling of the complaints, and has already smashed its target of \u0026pound50,000. By 2pm on Thursday, it had raised almost \u0026pound80,000.  But opposition figures criticised the fundraiser as \u0026ldquoastonishing, and suggested Mr Salmond was \u0026ldquosending a signal to those who have made allegations that he has the upper hand.  Former Labour first minister Jack McConnell was among those who urged people to donate to charities helping victims of sexual assault and harassment. Other Labour figures\u0026nbspcalled on supporters to donate to Women\u0026rsquos Aid.  In what some interpreted as a coded rebuke to Mr Salmond, Ms Sturgeon also tweeted her support for the Women\u0026rsquos Aid fundraiser on Thursday afternoon.  Ms Sturgeon previously said she felt a \u0026ldquohuge sadness and called the situation \u0026ldquoincredibly difficult both for the party and for the women who had complained about Mr Salmond.  She also restated her conviction that the complaints against him \u0026ldquomust be investigated without fear or favour and said independence was \u0026ldquobigger than any one individual.  Mr Salmond, 63, has started a judicial review at the Court of Session, arguing he was denied a fair chance to respond to the claims against him while being investigated by civil servants.  He said the costs would be \u0026ldquohuge and all sums received would go to his legal action, with anything left over going to good causes.  It comes after two civil servants complained about Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos behaviour while he was first minister, accusing him of sexual misconduct.  Police are examining the allegations, which Mr Salmond strenuously denies.  Earlier this week, he wrote to Scotland\u0027s top civil servant, calling for an inquiry into how the allegations against him were made public.  \"In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants,\" Mr Salmond said in the message.  \"It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.\""},{"url":null,"title":"sse-and-npower-merger-provisionally-cleared-by-regulator","story":"  The Competition and Markets Authority  had raised concerns that the tie-up could reduce competition in the market, which would likely lead to higher prices.

Soon, he had put that to the test, acquiring status by shooting a rival gang member in the head, but nine years later Marcos was handed a jail term which kept him behind bars in Pelican Bay supermax prison for 18 years.  Now he is a \u0026lsquotrainee\u0026rsquo with LA\u0026rsquos Homeboy Industries, a collection of social enterprises which employ and rehabilitate former gang members.  For men like Marcos, the scheme offers an alternative version of manhood, according to researcher Professor Ross Deuchar \u0026ndash for criminals who have only found family and role models in the gangs.  Marcos acknowledges this now himself \u0026ldquoI was basically looking for family, looking for some type of father-figure, you know? And then my older \u0026lsquohomies\u0026rsquo were father figures, he says.  Marcos features in a new book by Mr Deuchar, professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of the West of Scotland, highlighting the way Homeboy Industries and similar schemes on three continents are using spiritual approaches to reform gang members and offer them an alternative kind of masculinity.  The book also looks at work with biker gangs in Denmark, incorporating programmes based on yoga and breathing exercises, and a Christianity-based initiative with former triad members in Hong Kong.  Gangs And Spirituality - a Global Perspective - is being launched at an event at the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday, when Deuchar will discuss the Danish model and call for the Scottish Government to do more to promote such approaches in Scotland.  Street and Arrow, a food-truck business based on Homeboy Industries has already been established in Glasgow, but Scottish recidivism schemes tend to shy away from the spiritual, he says.  Yet the evidence is that participation in such programmes can change the lives of participants and give them a new way of thinking about manhood, he says. His book offers \u0026ldquonew insights about how the Scottish justice system can learn from the approaches used in Denmark.  While the Hong Kong scheme is Christian and Homeboy Industries was founded by a Jesuit priest, acts of faith are not critical, he argues. \u0026ldquoReligion is a system of worship and tradition but spirituality means different things to different people.  \u0026ldquoFor the older guys it was about having a language and framework for change. But they described it as almost a religious, spiritual experience, healing from the lifestyles and addictions they\u0026rsquod developed.  Crucially, all the groups he studied acted as an alternative to the \u0026lsquofamily\u0026rsquo of the gangs.  \u0026ldquoIt almost gives them a new kind of fellowship. Homeboy Industries is very much about love, kinship and community building.  \u0026ldquoDenmark is an increasingly secular society like our own, and religion is not seen as much more palatable, but meditation and breathing can be very powerful.  Seeing members of dangerous Danish biker gangs using Yoga to move away from dependency on drugs or violence was as impressive as it was counterintuitive, he says. But he was struck by the importance of ideas of what a \u0026lsquostrong\u0026rsquo man was to very many participants.  \u0026ldquoWhat if found with these groups all around the world was that as well as abuse and trauma in their background, they had this very toxic perception of what masculinity is about. These approaches let them deconstruct such narratives of violence, aggression and dominance. It is an approach we really need to become more open to."},{"url":null,"title":"serial-alex-salmond-critic-defends-former-leaders-actions","story":"  Jim Sillars, who was Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos SNP deputy in the early 1990s but is now a frequent critic, said the former leader deserved respect for his record.  He said his resignation from the SNP was \u0026ldquothe right thing to do as it took Nicola Sturgeon \u0026ldquooff the hook of having to respond to opposition calls to suspend him.  Mr Sillars said: \u0026ldquoHe did Nicola and the party a great favour.  Despite having five pensions and a show on a Kremlin-backed TV channel, Mr Salmond was not a wealthy man, Mr Sillars said.  It was therefore legitimate for him to crowdfund his judicial review at the Court of Session, especially, as he also faces the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos costs if he loses.  He said SNP members didn\u0026rsquot see it as a fight between Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon, but one between Mr Salmond and the administration overseen by Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos perfectly legitimate for Alex to ask the party that he has served so well over the years for help, and the response from people shows their regard for him.  \u0026ldquoThe fact is that Alex and I have disagreed over the years both over policy and how to run the party, but you can\u0026rsquot take away the service that he has given to the independence movement.  However Mr Sillars also rebuked Noel Dolan, a former special adviser to both Mr Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon as first minister, who said Ms Evans should quit if Mr Salmond won his judicial review action.  Mr Dolan, who is now retired from the Scottish Government, told the Sunday Herald: \u0026ldquoI have known Alex Salmond for over 35 years and I\u0026rsquove never seen any inappropriate behaviour, nor have I heard any allegations of sexual harassment prior to [last] Friday morning.  \u0026ldquoI expect Mr Salmond to be cleared of these allegations, and when that happens I hope Leslie Evans, the Permanent Secretary, will consider her position and resign.

He said: \u0026ldquoMy advice to Noel Dolan is wait until we know the full facts and the full judgment before talking about anyone resigning their job.  In previous years, Mr Sillars has condemned the \u0026ldquocult of personality in the SNP around first Mr Salmond and then Ms Sturgeon.  In 2012, he also accused Mr Salmond of creating a \u0026ldquototalitarian party that quashed internal dissent and had become \u0026ldquointellectually dumb as a consequence."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8488141.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-wildcat-kittens-go-viral","story":"  Shy and secretive - and on the brink of extinction - the Scottish Wildcat is ampng the most vulnerable animals on the planet.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Rees-Mogg also questioned the need for the Scottish Government to assume more powers over areas such as trade and immigration once the UK leaves the EU.  He said: \"Of course Scotland is entitled to have another referendum at some point in the future, but I think the SNP\u0027s position of a generation is a reasonable one.\"  \"It should be a generational decision and a generational decision is not made over two or three years.  \"A generation is somewhere beyond 20 years.\"  During the last independence referendum, the then First Minister Alex Salmond described the vote as being a \"once in a generation\" moment for the country to decide.  That has caused some difficulties for his old party since, as it wrestled with a desire from some within the SNP to push ahead with further plans for a second attempt sooner rather than later.  But others are said to want to focus efforts on the more immediate question of Brexit.  And on that, Mr Mogg said granting Holyrood further powers over immigration and trade could prove problematic - despite the Scottish government considering them as vital.  He said: \"There are some powers held by the European Union that will inevitably flow down to the devolved parliaments or assemblies.  \"Whether it\u0027s possible to do it on trade is a more complex issue because those are international treaties that affect the whole of the United Kingdom market and it would be difficult to do on a devolved basis.  \"The principle that powers that come from Brussels should, as far as possible, go to the constituent parts of the United Kingdom is a good one but that won\u0027t be possible for everything.\"  \"To do it for immigration would be really difficult because once people had come into Scotland, how would you limit their ability to go around the rest of the country?  \"We certainly don\u0027t want to be the sort of country that has internal controls or identify cards. I think that would undermine some of our most ancient freedoms.\"  Despite the fact the majority of Scots voted to stay within the UK, a different trend to elsewhere in the UK, he added: \"On a democratic basis the decision .. is as valid for Scotland as it is for the rest of the UK.\"  He also shrugged off research suggesting Scotland\u0027s GDP would fall by as much as 8.5% in the event a no-deal Brexit was forced through. claiming they were in some way jaundiced by those who commissioned them.  \"They\u0027re not in any sense properly independent,\" he said,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThese forecasts are predicated are based on the political outlook of the people commissioning the forecasts.\"  Regarded as a \u0027hard line\u0027 Brexiteer, the MP also insisted Theresa May would still be Prime Minister in a year\u0027s time, but heralded Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson as a potential heir.  He said: \"She would, at some future date, make a wonderful leader, both as first minister of Scotland and, in due course, leader of the Conservative party in England.  \"She is a wonderful, capable person.\"  \"I think Ruth Davidson is a brilliant, charismatic and capable political figure.\"  However his comments over independence, Brexit and the economy were rubbished by the SNP\u0027s Brexit Chief Mike Russell.  \"Trust in politics and trust in Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson evaporated a long time ago, given the way that the Brexit referendum was run and given their antics since then,\" he said. \"The way to restore trust in politics is to listen to the people and in Scotland that means to represent the people in Scotland who said \u0027we don\u0027t want to leave\u0027.

Confirmation of the action came as the crowdfunding campaign set up by the former first minister to help towards his legal costs got closer to raising \u0026pound100,000.

An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month. Over a four-week period and 63 cows, this will result in 11 tonnes less of fodder supplies used. While, focus farmer Jim Gammie reported success using woodchips over the last two years, which he is also composting for further land use.Those interested in finding out more or getting involved in a focus group, are invited to get in touch with Declan or Robert on 01467 623 838 or farmprofit@anmgroup, or by stopping by the Farm Profit Programme office located in the concourse at Thainstone Centre.

During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Friday 31 Aug 2018 6:45

QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation.

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Friday 31 Aug 2018 6:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Friday 31 Aug 2018 6:46 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Friday 31 Aug 2018 6:46 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

It\u0026#8217s unlikely that a politician with the instincts of Alex Salmond would have failed to anticipate the uproar caused by his announcement he was launching a crowdfunder to support a legal challenge relating to allegations of sexual misconduct levelled at him.                 The former First Minister has smashed his original £50,000 target after hundreds of donations poured in, and at the time of writing is knocking on the door of hitting £100,000.             It comes as Mr Salmond has officially lodged papers beginning a judicial review against the Scottish Government over their handling of two complaints of sexual harassment made in January this year.             READ MORE: What we know so far about Alex Salmond allegationsThey relate to alleged misbehaviour from when Mr Salmond was First Minister in 2013. Allegations he strongly refutes.His successor, Nicola Sturgeon, has not commented on the fundraiser, but Rhoda Grant MSP, the women’s spokesperson for Scottish Labour, said: “Alex Salmond is abusing his power, and dragging Scotland into the gutter.” Questions have been asked over whether someone in his position needs to rely on the public for his legal funds. With that in mind, we look at the former SNP leader’s income, salary, and wealth.            Salary There aren’t many people who wouldn’t feel the pinch after the sudden loss of a job that commands a salary of around £77,000. As many of Mr Salmond’s defenders have pointed out, he has lost a significant annual amount from his shock election defeat last year. Yet, calculations made by The Times suggested the former First Minister has been paid around £2.2million as an MP and MSP since the 1980s.Which leaves only his broadcasting and presenting work as his only source of income, bar his pensions and other benefits .             Mr Salmond had a highly successful run at the Fringe in Edinburgh last year with his ‘Alex Salmond Unleashed’ show following his defeat. Tickets were priced at £22.50, with a £17.50 concession price, some of the most expensive of last years Fringe. READ MORE: Alex Salmond resigns from the SNP amid allegationsAll 17 shows sold out, meaning the former First Minister played to around 6,000 people. If they paid an average of £20 each, that means total revenue of £120,000 for the show. That doesn’t take into account overheads, such as renting the venue and paying his fellow performers, but even if only half of that figure is profit, Mr Salmond still made far more than your average Fringe performer, many of whom lose money.             Mr Salmond’s salary for his weekly show on controversial broadcaster Russia Today is not disclosed, although he was paid £15,000 for 6 months work on radio station LBC for a weekly phone-in while still an MP. BenefitsFor an erstwhile politician with a length of service like Mr Salmond’s, there are more routes of income through public service. There have been several controversies about his earnings throughout his career, most recently in 2014.Then-candidate Mr Salmond refused to hand back a ‘golden goodbye’ resettlement grant that he received in 2010 when leaving Westminster, the parliament he returned to in 2015. The grant was worth around £65,000. As long as he was an elected politician, Mr Salmond donated his pension relating to his spell as First Minister to a charity set up in his mother’s name. It is believed that now he is no longer an MP or an MSP, Mr Salmond isn’t donating the sum of around £40,000 he receives annually. While the individual MP/MSP pension pots aren’t disclosed, Mr Salmond is believed to be entitled to at least £40,000 annually from his pensions in those jobs. An £8,500 state pension will kick in from December 2020. Charitable givingAlex Salmond’s defenders, of whom several have gone on record, point to his long record of charitable giving. One was quoted in saying the former First Minister was ‘not a wealthy man’. The Mary Salmond trust, named in honour of Mr Salmond’s late mother, is thought to have distributed more than £160,000 to good cause among youth and community groups in the North-East of Scotland. When he held ‘dual mandates’ as both an MP and an MSP, as he did on two separate occasions, he gave one of the salaries he was entitled to towards the charitable trust. During his Fringe show, Mr Salmond auctioned off lunches with himself and his guests, and other prizes, raising an estimated £30,000.While some of his income is hard to quantify, one thing is certain – the fundraiser, and the court case that Mr Salmond is using it for, while remain controversial as long as they last."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4793176.1535732644!/image/image.jpg","title":"frank field told to withdraw resignation or face labour explusion","story":"        Labour veteran Frank Field has been told to withdraw his resignation or face expulsion from the party.

I said I would think about it because it is crazy to spend an hour with the chief whip and not think about what he said, but I didn’t express any enthusiasm for that.”            Mr Field said the meeting was cordial, but he was left in little doubt the party did not want him to stay a member if he did not take the whip.He said: “I said that I wish to remain a member of the Labour party. I had an hour with him and a good chat.“I absolutely want to remain a member of the party.“There are members of the House of Lords who don’t take the Labour whip.            “I will argue on that basis that I have a right to remain a member of the party.“They continue to pay their Labour membership fees.”He added: “I will be looking for a solicitor, whoever that might be.”The long-standing Labour man earlier told BBC Breakfast he was considering whether to trigger a by-election if he could not remain in the party.But he stressed his resignation of the whip over the anti-semitism crisis was not part of a plot to bring down the Labour leader.            “I hope and I believe Jeremy will lead us into the next election and it is not true I’m a constant critic of Jeremy,” Mr Field said.“That isn’t true.“I believe he has the right to take us into the next election because he has won two leadership contests.“The idea this is part of a plot or anything else is simply crazy. It is because I think he will lead us into the next election that I think these issues are urgent.”READ MORE: Alex Salmond’s lawyers serve legal papers on Scottish GovernmentHowever, Mr Field added he felt Mr Corbyn’s thanks for his service was “as though I was resigning from a whist club” and pointed out he had been a member of Labour longer than his leader.The Birkenhead MP also denied claims he was jumping before he was pushed, having lost a no-confidence vote within his constituency Labour party after backing Brexit.He said: “I have been through all this before when I have been deselected and I am still the Labour party candidate.“I wish to be the Labour party candidate at the next election and, if I am not, I shall stand as an independent Labour candidate.“The people who decide this are not a small caucus of 30-odd people, but the 70,000 electors of Birkenhead.”Responding to claims by Labour MP Chris Williamson he had made “grotesque slurs with no basis in reality” about bullying within his constituency Labour Party that had been “previously resolved”, Mr Field was scathing.“If they have investigated it and concluded it is all fictitious, they have never told me,” he said.“I have been writing and copying in the chief whip saying this is still going on, this is new material for you.“It is just untrue for an unknown Labour party spokesman to say that.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783615.1535721477!/image/image.jpg","title":"homebase creditors vote to shut ten scottish stores","story":"        Homebase is pressing ahead with the closure of ten Scotland stores as part of a restructure of the embattled retailer.

Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Scotland should be allowed to hold a second referendum on independence \u0026#8211 but not for around 20 years.                The Conservative MP, who is one of the party’s most hard line Brexiteers, made the comments as he arrived in Scotland on a short speaking tour.            He said he agreed with Alex Salmond’s previous view that the 2014 vote on Scottish independence was a “once in a generation” decision which should not be revisited in the short term.            “Of course Scotland is entitled to have another referendum at some point in the future, but I think the SNP’s position of a ‘generation’ is a reasonable one – that it should be a generational decision,” he told the BBC. “A generational decision is not one made over two or three years.”READ MORE: Flashback: When Jacob Rees-Mogg campaigned in Fife with his nannyHe added that 20 years was a more realistic timeframe for another vote on Scottish independence, meaning that it would not take place until nearly 2040.

Despite their different political backgrounds, Mr Rees-Mogg also praised the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, tipping her as a future leader of the UK party.“I think Ruth Davidson is a brilliant, charismatic and capable political figure, I admire her hugely,” he said.“She will at some future date make a wonderful leader, both as First Minister in Scotland and in due course leader of the Conservative Party in England.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

The devolved Parliament was supposed to find Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, but too often it has done little more than tinker at the edges of the big issues, writes Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard.                Next year marks the 20th anniversary of the election of the first Scottish Parliament, so now is a good time to look back in order to set our forward direction.              As Labour stalwart Tom Johnston once said, a people which does not understand the past, will never comprehend the present, nor mould the future.                And for me it is unashamedly personal as well as political. One of my first jobs when I went to work for the Scottish TUC in the early 1990s, was to help develop an ‘agenda’ for the Scottish Parliament entitled “Power for Change”.  The clue is in the name. We were constructing the case for a devolved Scottish Parliament based on some important principles. Some of them were defensive, like the creation of a Parliament that would be a bulwark against Tory Governments at Westminster, others democratic like the replacement of appointed Scottish Office Ministers with a directly elected Parliament.But others again were constructed on the case that not only could we design and implement Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, but that we could also start to develop a more radical programme for Government.    The aim was to tackle the big challenges, including long-term structural weaknesses in the Scottish economy, and deliver a new agenda for Scotland’s public services, health, housing, transport and all with a cultural dimension. It was power for a purpose: it was power for change.            The Parliament has achieved much: land reform, homelessness legislation, and bold climate change targets. But yet, many of those ambitions remain unrealised and what’s worse, there is all too often an air of complacency, even indifference inside the Parliament on the Government benches.READ MORE: Richard Leonard: How public money is used to exploit Scottish workersThis has led to too much tinkering at the edges of problems: and so too much timidity and mediocrity. As a result, there is no bulwark against Tory austerity in the way that we envisaged. The Parliament looks too often like a factory conveyor belt than a workshop where we build Scottish solutions to Scottish problems.The structural problems of the Scottish economy are largely untackled. So, we still rely on just 70 producers for 50 per cent of all our export value. Five firms account for 26 per cent of all research and development by businesses.             Moreover, instead of building up our indigenous industrial base we have seen an even greater slide into a branch plant economic model, which is reliant on decisions made by remote big businesses. There is no industrial strategy at work and a singular lack of economic planning even of the first order. So, we spend on renewable energy, but fail to generate the work in the supply chain.There are those who will argue that the reason for this failure is that we do not have political independence. However, the devolved Scottish Parliament does have the powers to tackle many of these challenges, it is just that the SNP Government chooses not to use them.Meeting people in communities across Scotland – from the Shetland Isles in the north, to the Outer Hebrides in the west, and the Mull of Galloway in the south over the past few weeks – three issues came up time and again: the crisis in the NHS, the shortage of suitable housing, particularly public and housing association provided homes, and the continued squeeze on working people – including those in retirement – as a direct result of austerity. READ MORE: Richard Leonard: We can’t go back to the old style of politicsAnd just this week Scottish Labour revealed that the number of children living in poverty, despite having a parent in work, has soared to 40,000. The figure was even worse if the parents could only find part-time jobs.            It is clear that our economy desperately needs real change, not more of the same. Labour would take radical action to drive up incomes with a £10 per hour minimum wage, an end to zero-hours contracts and a £260 increase to Child Benefit, by using Holyrood’s powers over social security. Any government simply has to be judged on its actions, not its words. You cannot truthfully be said to be ‘Scotland’s champion’ while our NHS stumbles through one crisis after another, whilst police numbers are going down, when our many of our schools are struggling, and when the attainment at Higher level is in decline.We are now offering a radical agenda for change that the SNP Government is simply unwilling to match. They have failed to deliver in the areas of Scotland that needed extra support the most. Labour is the only party that offers a government that will fight for real change for working people across the country.So, let us start in this new session of Parliament with the new powers we have to improve the income of our pensioners who have served this society well, but let us also start using the old powers to put people back to work on a warm homes programme which meets an outstanding social, environmental and economic need.  The summer recess is normally a time for reflection, renewal and action, but by taking Labour’s message across the country, I have been showing how our party will deliver a government that works for all of Scotland, one that is on the side of communities and workers.That’s why I want to go to the people of Scotland in 2021 with the most radical social and economic manifesto for change in the history of the Parliament – one that is true to those founding principles which drove the campaign for the Scottish Parliament. And that is one which recognises real change is possible and that we can mould the future."},{"url":null,"title":"eu piles pressure on uk over irish border plan","story":"        The EU chief Brexit negotiator has piled pressure on the UK over the unresolved issue of the Irish border, warning that no deal can be agreed without a legally enforceable \u0026#8216backstop\u0026#8217 proposal.

His comments set the stage for the contentious Irish issue to remain at the centre of talks over the next six weeks, ahead of a summit of EU leaders in October that London continues to see as the deadline for a deal to be reached.            Mr Barnier was speaking following a six-hour round of face-to-face talks with the UK Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Theresa May dances as no-deal Brexit catastrophe loomsThe pair hailed progress on other issues relating to justice and security cooperation after Brexit, but data sharing and the EU system of geographic indicators for food and drink produce also remain unresolved.

That threatens to erect an internal trade barrier in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.In a sign that the EU is not prepared to shift its stance, Mr Barnier said he had asked his UK counterpart for “a certain amount of data which is necessary for technical work… [on] how the necessary controls and checks take place”.            “The backstop is critical,” he insisted. “It’s essential to conclude negotiations because as I’ve said, without a backstop, there can be no agreement.”READ MORE: EU warned to give Chequers a chance or brace for no-deal BrexitMr Raab said: \"On Northern Ireland we remain committed to giving effect to the joint report, continuing the work on the potential solutions, working with Michel and his team on some of the issues he\u0027s raised and continuing to drive that forward.\"The solutions must be workable, they\u0027ve got to be workable for the communities living in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic of Ireland.\"Mr Barnier warned that a deal must be signed by \"November at the latest\". EU leaders will meet on 18 October, and while agreement on a withdrawal deal is no longer seen as likely by that data, Mr Raab said that he wanted to continue \"accelerating and intensifying\" negotiations.            \"We\u0027re committed to resolving the deal by [October] and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach.\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4792117.1535661062!/image/image.jpg","title":"scott macnab salmond saga taking its toll on nicola sturgeon as split in snp loyalties sets scene for hostile return to parliament","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.  Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself ?  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8615735.1535446354!/image/image.jpg","title":"continuing success at cambridge house","story":"\nFollowing on from the superb set of A Level results as recorded last week, with pupils gaining 87% in three A*-C grades, Cambridge House Grammar School pupils continue this success with a consistent increase in their GCSE grades.\n\n                \nNinety per cent of pupils achieved seven or more A*-C grades, while 96 per cent achieved five A*-C grades.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

This significantly exceeds the National and Northern Ireland averages and places our school and is testimony to the success which can be attained at a non-selective school. \n  \n Many factors contribute to such success, not least the support of parents, the commitment of students and the motivational teaching which is inspirational yet grounded, and which proves that high expectations enable students to push boundaries and indeed predictions. \n  \nSubjects which achieved the outstanding success rate of 100% of pupils gaining Grade C or better were as follows: Art, Construction, Media Studies, Double Award Science, Occupational Studies, Further Maths, Prince’s Trust, Agriculture \u0026amp Community Sport. Other high achieving subjects included: Applied Business 70%, English 80%, English Literature 92%, Engineering 70%, French 75%, Geography 79%, ICT 70%, Single Award Science 78%, Technology \u0026amp Design 91%, Drama 91%, Music 82%, BTEC Sport 91%\n  \nThe Principal noted that amongst the numerous excellent combinations of grades were children with special educational needs, and many personal best achievements. It was also very encouraging to note that 96% of all students in the year group achieved at least 5 grades in the A – E range.\n  \nCongratulations to top achievers: Kirsten McLeister - 5 A* and 3A, Craig Francey - 4A*, 4A, 1B and 1C and Charlotte McKay 1A*, 4A, 2B and 1C.\n  \nOther students with a profile of A - C grades in eight or more subjects included: Stuart Adams, Tori Agnew, Chloe Bleakley, Alan Clarke, Daniel Compton, Megan Davison, Laura Du Bois Pidgeon, Amy Ewart, Joy Forsythe, Rachel Greer, Abigail Harris, Timothy Hill, Korben Houston, Lynn Hughes, Deanna Johnston, Jamie Knox, Danielle Mahaffy, Tamzin McClenaghan, Adam McConnell, Grace McCullough, Emma McDowell, Thomas McFall, Megan McKay, Luke Neeson, Robbie O’Neill, Aimee Penney, David Saunderson, Chad Shaw, Joshua Shaw, Robyn Telford, Charlotte Waide, James Warwick, Leah Young. This, in addition to the list of students, too numerous to list, who achieved 7 top grades.\n  \nInterviews are currently underway at the College for Sixth Form places and/or advice for students on the next steps in their learning. Applications are also welcome from students from other schools. Admissions Criteria and the details of subjects on offer are available at the School Office.\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017  and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

The results are amazing and they have clearly drawn inspiration from a iety of sources.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I would like to congratulate all our finalists, Andrew Moore, James Magennis and Charles Leathem, who have each taken some of our iconic packaging and transformed it into a catwalk sensation, showcasing the raw talent of some of our stars of the future.”\n\nClaire Concannon, course co-ordinator from Belfast politan College, added: “Working with crisp packaging has been a very valuable learning experience for our ingenious students who have more than risen to the challenge. The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks. The company remains family-owned by the Hutchinsons and is now run by Thomas’s children. Since its beginnings more than 60 years ago, Tayto has grown into an international business, supplying crisps and snacks produced in Tandragee to more than 40 countries across the world.\n\nDuring the last 12 years, Tayto has acquired iconic crisp and snack brands, Golden Wonder, Real Crisps, Mr Porky, Jonathan Crisp and Portlebay Popcorn through its parent organisation Tayto Group. Across the Group, more than five million packets of crisps and snacks are produced each day at its six UK factories.

education provided\u0026#8221. \n\n                \nOnce again, an impressive number of pupils in the cohort achieved five or more GCSE passes at A* - C. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nPrincipal Mrs A McCullough said the results reward the hard work of the pupils, the dedication of the staff and very positive parental support. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It is also important to recognise the contribution of our partners in the Banbridge Area Learning Community, “ she said. “This partnership allows us to offer a diverse range of subjects which affords pupils a wider choice at KS4.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“This year’s set of results reinforces our reputation as a high performing, non-selective secondary school. \n\n“Rathfriland High School has provided opportunities and opened doors across a diverse range of further education and training which will allow these leavers to choose whichever pathway most suits their skills and talents. \n\n“I would like to congratulate our pupils on their success, perseverance and industry. \n\n“I would also pay tribute to the talented and professional teaching staff who play a pivotal role in these achievements.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“Parents also provide crucial support for our young people and I wish to thank them. \n\n“The performance of some pupils is particularly worthy of note, Alexandria Harbinson, Geri Georgieva, Laura Adams, Emily Cantley, Mallory Lutton, Jessica Thomas and Kerry Martin.\t\n\n“Success such as this only comes about when pupils, parents and staff work together to ensure all children reach their potential.  \n\n“We celebrate all our pupils’ achievement at this time and wish them every success for the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n

on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

unless an operational “backstop” arrangement for the Irish border can be agreed.\n\nBut he said was “determined” to reach an agreement ahead of the October deadline, though he said there would be “flexibility” for further negotiations.\n\nStanding alongside Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, he said: “Week after week and step by step we are eliminating subjects, bones of contention… I’m determined, we’re going to find an agreement for an orderly withdrawal which is much better than the opposite and Dominic and I think it’s possible to reach that in October.”\n\nMr Barnier added: “If you take account of the date chosen by the United Kingdom to leave, that’s March 29 which is in UK law and you simply count backwards the time that you need for ratification about three months here or there then it takes you to November at the latest.\n\n“It’s as simple as that.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier \n\n\n\n\nIt follows concerns that a deal may fail to materialise before the deadline.\n\nMr Raab said that he wanted to continue “accelerating and intensifying” negotiations, adding: “We’re committed to resolving the deal by  and ultimately on my side I am stubbornly optimistic that a deal is within our reach.”\n\nEarlier, Mr Barnier said a backstop is “essential to conclude the negotiations”, stating: “With no backstop there will be no agreement.”\n\n\n\nOn Northern Ireland we remain committed to giving effect to the joint report, continuing the work on the potential solutions, working with Michel and his team on some of the issues he\u0027s raised and continuing to drive that forward\nDominic Raab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nHe described the issue as a “matter of some urgency”, adding that he had asked the Brexit Secretary to provide data on how the “necessary controls and checks take place”.\n\nThe Prime Minister has repeatedly said she will refuse to contemplate any backstop deal that treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK.\n\nIn the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain.\n\nThe UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole.\n\nMr Raab said the Government “remained committed” to finding a solution in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nAnti-Brexit billboards on the northern side of the Irish border \n\n\n\n\nHe said: “On Northern Ireland we remain committed to giving effect to the joint report, continuing the work on the potential solutions, working with Michel and his team on some of the issues he’s raised and continuing to drive that forward.\n\n“The solutions must be workable, they’ve got to be workable for the communities living in Northern Ireland and living in the Republic of Ireland.”\n\nMr Barnier also told media in Brussels that the future partnership between the EU and UK would be without precedent.\n\nHe said: “If we achieve what was in the March guidelines then you really do have a partnership with no precedent, this a very ambitious free trade agreement, specific agreements in all sorts of area of common interest.”\n\nMr Barnier was later asked if he believed the Conservative Party Conference would have an impact on negotiations, he said: “I’m not going to comment on the internal political life on the UK, conferences of this party or that party.\n\n“We’re negotiating with Theresa May’s Government with Dominic Raab and his team and they’re the ones round the negotiating table.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"wellknown retailers in talks with victoria square

What is important to us is a solution that is in the best interest of the people of Belfast, the employees of House of Fraser and our investors.\"\n\nCommerz Real would not give any detail on the identity of the retailers who have expressed interest in the site. The spokesman said: \"It is simply too early to communicate any details. First we have to have clarity about House of Fraser. We have been very satisfied with their performance and would like to further co-operate with them.\"\n\nCommercial property agents Lambert Smith Hampton, which manages lettings at Victoria Square, said it had no comment to make on the prospect of a new tenant at the House of Fraser unit.\n\nTycoon Mike Ashley bought House of Fraser out of administration for £90m earlier this month. \n\nTalks with landlords have resulted in around seven House of Fraser branches being saved from closure, including one in London\u0027s Oxford Street.\n\nHowever, there has been no confirmation about the fate of the Belfast store. \n\nHowever, one industry insider said he believed the unit would be easily filled in the event of a decision to shut it down. He said that Victoria Square was considered a desirable retail location as it was built only 10 years ago.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"cameras ready to roll on line of duty new series","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"man 60s left shaken after gang of masked men","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC

However, its unregulated electricity increase is higher than the regulated Power NI increase of 13.8%, announced earlier this month. SSE Airtricity needs to explain this difference to its customers.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest traffic and travel","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

Those who haven\u0027t had a repeat test have either chosen not to take up the offer, or have an identified reason for why a test is not appropriate for them at this time.\n\n\"As expected, the majority of results of the repeat tests have been reported as normal.  A very small number of women have been referred to colposcopy for further investigation. \n\n\"The PHA and HSCB are unable to release specific numbers or further details to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch the moment foul smelling whey sprayed across co tyrone towns main street","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It happened on the Glenshane Road, not far from the house he had set up with Sinead in Maghera, halfway between their family homes in Newbridge and Ballerin, near Garvagh.\n\nA transport planner in Swatragh who married Sinead in July last year, he had been told just weeks before his death that he was going to be a dad, and friends said he was ecstatic.\n\nAfter passing away several days after the collision, Sinead, a dental nurse in Antrim Area Hospital, donated his organs for transplant, and she was later told they had saved lives in three major operations.\n\nAs she tried to cope with her grief, Sinead was preparing to give birth to her baby, who was due on July 2.\n\nShe said: \"They were going to let me go 10 days before bringing me into hospital but I didn\u0027t want to be there around the time of our first wedding anniversary on the 14th. So I asked if I could go in earlier.\"\n\nSinead said she tried to focus her attention on the baby, but she had a photograph of Shaun beside her all the time.\n\nSeventeen hours after Sinead went into the maternity unit her labour started, and Ellen made her entrance into the world 15 minutes later as her mother received encouragement from sisters Marian and Clare.\n\n\"Everything was fine and when I held Ellen Rose in my arms it was a great feeling. She was just gorgeous,\" Sinead added. \n\n\"I don\u0027t know who she looks like. I think there\u0027s a bit of both me and Shaun in there somewhere but she changes from day to day. I\u0027m just pleased that Ellen is healthy and doing so well. Sean would have spoilt her rotten. He was fantastic with children. He doted on all his nephews and nieces and they all adored him.\n\n\"He was very excited at the prospect of being a father. And we discussed a couple of names, though we didn\u0027t know if I was having a boy or a girl.\n\n\"Shaun knew that the name Ellen was a strong possibility because his late mum was called Helen.\"\n\nSinead says Shaun\u0027s relations have been extremely supportive of her and the latest addition to the family.\n\nFive days after what would have been the Mullans\u0027 first wedding anniversary in July, Sinead introduced her baby on social media. And she also talked movingly about the pain of losing her husband.\n\nSinead described Ellen as \u00276lbs 11oz of perfection\u0027 and she appealed for friends to share stories about her dad.\n\n\"As hard as it is to talk about Shaun, I want Ellen to know everything about her daddy, so all PG stories are welcome,\" she wrote, adding that she knew how much Shaun would have loved his daughter.\n\n\"That makes it all the harder. My head and my heart are full of mixed emotions. I would love to hear Shaun talk back to me to give me some advice. I know he wouldn\u0027t want me to feel so down and would want to make it right.\"\n\nSinead said her daughter is a dream baby. \"She\u0027s sleeping right through the night already,\" she added. \"She\u0027s very mellow.\"\n\nEllen has captured the hearts of Shaun\u0027s former team-mates at his football club. Sinead took her to a recent wedding of one of her husband\u0027s friends.\n\nAnd a colleague who was there said: \"Ellen had supposedly big and tough Gaelic footballers cooing all around her. She\u0027s lovely. She would have been the apple of Shaun\u0027s eye.\"\n\nEllen won\u0027t remember a thing about it, obviously, but she\u0027ll get her first taste of Gaelic football\u0027s big time on Sunday. Sinead says her baby\u0027s name was picked out of a raffle for two tickets for the All-Ireland final.\n\nSinead\u0027s brother Matthew bought the raffle tickets for his new niece at his GAA club in Newbridge. Initially it was thought that Sinead could take someone else, as well as Ellen, to the final.\n\nBut she has been informed that babies who go to Croke Park for sell-out games still need a ticket of their own even if they are in the arms of a parent.\n\nSinead and Ellen have an important \u0027fixture\u0027 the day before the final.\n\nFor that\u0027s the date of the christening, and she\u0027ll be wearing a very special gown for the ceremony.\n\nThe proud mum added: \"I\u0027ve had it made from material from my wedding dress and from the shirt that Shaun wore on our big day.\n\n\"We will head down to Dublin on Sunday morning. It\u0027ll be a busy weekend,\" said Sinead, who insisted that she\u0027ll be maintaining a diplomatic neutrality during the showdown between two teams who aren\u0027t exactly huge favourites in the Oak Leaf County.\n\n\"I\u0027m just going for the day out,\" she laughed.\n\nShe says that she\u0027s still missing Shaun desperately, writing online of the tragedy that engulfed her.\n\nShe wrote: \"I would never wish this upon anyone but wish it wasn\u0027t us. Our plans got cut short and for now I just exist.\"\n\nSinead said she has been pleased to hear the difference Shaun\u0027s organs have meant to other people.\n\nHis liver was donated to a man in his 60s for a life-saving transplant. His kidneys were given to a man in his 50s who had been on the waiting list for three years, and to a woman in her 30s who had been waiting for two-and-a-half years for a transplant.\n\nSinead got a letter from the mother of one of the organ recipients to say thank you to her and her family. She\u0027ll keep the letter and the tributes to her husband to show Ellen as she grows up.\n\n\"I\u0027ll be talking to her about Shaun non-stop,\" she added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"council steps up efforts to help city centre recover after blaze","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

It has knocked the heart out of me.”\n\nThe Oxfam charity shop a few doors down was also struggling.\n\nIt previously benefited from a high volume of passing trade from the large Primark store in Bank Buildings.\n\nManager Tra Walls said she was moving racks of clothes outside the shop door to make the street look more active.\n\n“We are not doing great,” she said. “The customers that have made it to us said they weren’t sure if they could come into the street.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolunteer Paddy Mooney and Tra Walls, manager of the Oxfam Store\n\n\n\n\n“We are OK because we get a lot of our stock free, and we have volunteers.\n\n“It is much tougher for businesses with staff to pay.\n\n“I am putting racks of clothes outside to make the street look busier. Hopefully if customers can see activity on the street, they will be more likely to come down.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sectarian atrocity was carried out as republic claimed famous world cup win","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

crowded around the TV in the tiny Heights Bar in Loughinisland were longing for the final whistle.\n\nRay Houghton had scored his famous looping volley and Jack Charlton’s team were writing another chapter in World Cup folklore.\n\nThe UVF gunmen knew what they were doing.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nCampaigners for the victims of the 1994 Loughinisland pub shooting \n\n\n\n\nNationalists in Northern Ireland felt more affiliation with the Republic’s football team, so the killers were aware the bar in the Co Down village was likely to be crowded with Catholics.\n\nIn their perverse logic, it was a perfect target for the latest blow in the bloody tit-for-tat sectarian bloodshed of the Troubles.\n\nAround 10.10pm, two men armed with automatic rifles and wearing boiler suits and balaclavas burst through the doors shortly after the second half had kicked off at Giants Stadium, and opened fire.\n\nThey sprayed the bar with bullets as the football fans dived for cover.\n\nBy the end of killing spree six men had been killed, and five were injured.\n\nIt was the horrific events of that night, and the persistent claims of state involvement in them, that provided the focus of film maker Alex Gibney’s No Stone Unturned documentary. \n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe Republic of Ireland team wore black armbands in commemoration during a Euro 2012 group match in Poland \n\n\n\n\nThe 2017 film, which Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey worked on, broke new ground by naming what it claimed were key suspects.\n\nOne of those murdered at Loughinisland was pensioner Barney Green. \n\nAt 87, he was one of the oldest victims of the Troubles.\n\nThe others were Adrian Rogan, 34, Malcolm Jenkinson, 53, Daniel McCreanor, 59, Patrick O’Hare, 35, and Eamon Byrne, 39.\n\nWithin months, loyalist paramilitaries had declared a ceasefire and the Troubles were nearing an end.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nEmma Rogan, holds a photo of her father Adrian who was one of the victims \n\n\n\n\nAlmost 25 years on, the sectarian massacre remains seared in the memory of the village and beyond.\n\nIn 2012, the Republic of Ireland played Italy in the group stages of the European Championships in Poland. \n\nBy coincidence the encounter fell on the same day as their historic encounter in 1994.\n\nThe Irish players took to the field wearing black armbands, a visible sign that the victims of Loughinisland would not be forgotten.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nBarney Green, 87, was one of the oldest victims of the Troubles/PA\n\n\n\n\n“I think it’s only right that we do wear the armbands out of respect for everyone’s families,” said Ireland’s then striker Robbie Keane. \n\n“To let them know as a team, and as a nation, we’re thinking of the families.”\n\nIn 2016, the anniversary again fell on a crunch Republic of Ireland match, this time against Belgium in Bordeaux during Euro 2016. \n\nOn that occasion the fans were asked to stand up during the sixth minute to commemorate the six fans who never lived to see the final whistle a generation earlier.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"7 causes for optimism","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n

The fish are tiny — anywhere from 1–3 inches long — which allows more than 95% of them to survive the fall. \n#Utah\n \n#TroutTuesday\n \npic.twitter/kotDe91Zzw\n\n— Utah DWR  \nAugust 21, 2018\n\n\n\n\nSince it was posted online more than a week ago, it has generated thousands of likes, shares and comments.\n\nBut what’s happening? Above a lake, the belly of the plane opens to release a cargo of fish and water.\n\nThe trout are so small – between one to three inches in length – that the fall from the plane doesn’t hurt them. \n\n“Think of it as a high diver diving into a deep pool of water,” said Utah DWR on Twitter.\n\n\n \npic.twitter/EXtDwn0a3k\n\n— Hans Olsen  \nAugust 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAnd it’s kinder to have them travel by air to the mountaintop rather than by road because that journey can be longer and more stressful on the fish, according to officials.\n\nAlthough they initially state that 95% survive, the true figure is between 95% and 99%. \n\n\nTransporting the fish by ground takes a lot longer, and it\u0027s much more stressful on the fish. The survival rate is much higher from the air — usually between 95–99%.\n— Utah DWR  \nAugust 22, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“These are high mountain fisheries,” Utah DWR explained on Twitter. \n\n“People who are hiking and camping often enjoy fishing during their trips. We stock these lakes to provide fishing opportunities for the public.”\n\n\nOne of the most interesting videos I’ve seen lately. The video is even more interesting because the fish fall at different trajectory than water. Because of the air resistance the water slows down faster than the fish. \nhttps:t.co/fxUgfHXA9n\n\n— Jurij  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is possibly the most interesting video ever. \nhttps:t.co/eTGMKew99K\n\n— Dain Bramaged  \nAugust 31, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly moley, it\u0027s raining fish! \nhttps:t.co/zSPONRLOCf\n\n— Gilagan  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\nPeople compared the scene to a Fortnite battle, dubbed it TroutNado, and made multiple jokes about “fly fishing”. \n\n\nI feel sort of like when you find out the Tooth Fairy is just your parents. \nhttps:t.co/YIChWALX07\n\n— Nadia Pflaum  \nAugust 23, 2018\n\n\n\n\nThe practice is known as extreme fish stocking. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"usain bolt makes football debut in australia","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The fund is administered by Council on behalf of the Derry and Strabane Rural Partnership, one of ten Local Action Groups working across NI.\n\nThe Derry City and Strabane District Council area has been allocated a total of £7.54 million up to 2020 to improve economic prosperity in rural areas. The Rural Business Investment Scheme is open to new or existing micro or small businesses and social economy enterprises involved in the non-agricultural or non agri-food sectors based in rural areas. To date Derry and Strabane Rural Partnership has awarded over £1.3 million through the scheme to 26 businesses which is creating up to 69 new jobs in rural areas. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThe programme aims to support rural enterprises in areas such as job creation and enhancing export potential, as well as assisting with marketing. This may be the final opportunity to avail of funding under this scheme so businesses which are investment ready are being urged to apply. Funding of up to £90,000 per business may be available. \n\nMayor of Derry City and Strabane District, Cllr John Boyle said supporting rural business was a key priority for Council and encouraged businesses to avail of this funding opportunity by attending the workshops next week.\n\nHe said: “Our Council has a vast rural area and we are very conscious of the specific needs of people living and working in rural communities. Enhancing connectivity and supporting rural enterprise and investment are essential to the success of the local economy and are key priorities of the Strategic Growth Plan for the City and District.\n\n“This scheme offers the opportunity for small rural companies to avail of the support they need to take their business to the next level. I would really urge business owners to go along to the workshops to find out how they could benefit.”\n\nChair of Derry \u0026amp Strabane Rural Partnership, William Lamrock said: “This is the fifth call for this round of funding and we are delighted that the scheme is already having a positive impact on rural business with up to 69 new jobs being supported to date through the scheme.

Building on the success of last year’s event, SuperValu has introduced new categories to help capture the good work done across the whole spectrum of Northern Ireland society.\n\nLast year Derry man, Nathaniel Hunter was named joint second place whilst teenager, Jamie Harkin, took the joint third place, both winning SuperValu shopping vouchers and a framed certificate.\n\nNathaniel was awarded for his quick thinking and reactions when a pleasant stroll along the beach turned into a rescue drama for himself and his wife when they realised three children, aged 10, 11 and 12, had been swept out to sea. The coastguard had already been alerted and were on their way, but Nathaniel knew there was no time to lose, dashed to get a buoyancy aid and raced into the water, swimming out to the terrified kids.\n\nAnother young man followed and brought the closest child to safety whist Nathaniel swam on, getting hold of one youngster and throwing the aid to another. A strong swimmer, he brought them both back to the beach were they were treated in hospital but lived to tell the tale. Nathaniel was praised by the coastguard and of course the families of the young lives he saved that day.\n\nJamie also from Derry, had a story of extreme courage and kindness in the most challenging of circumstances. Poignantly, this exceptional young man was nominated by his mum Trisha, who had recently passed away but the family took the tough decision to proceed with the SuperStars nomination in their mother’s honour. Seven years previously Jamie was diagnosed with blood cancer Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.\n\nHis late mum told of how, before, during and after an unsuccessful organ transplant Jamie never complained. He went on to set up a wonderful support group called Jamie’s Journey in a bid to give hope to other young people touched by cancer. During his exams, the brave young man, whilst taking regular hits of morphine due to the pain, battled on and gained 10As and A*s in his GCSEs. Like many, the inspiring young man is a Star Wars fan, and after winning every fan’s dream prize of a custom light sabre, he selflessly raffled it to raise funds for charity.\n\nDue to popular demand, the deadline for entries has been extended by two weeks to Friday 14th September.\n\nStephen Bogle, SuperValu Brand Manager, said: “With entries flooding in from right across Northern Ireland, we are one step closer to finding this year’s SuperValu SuperStars. The level of interest has been fantastic and we’re giving people one final chance to nominate the people they feel deserve their moment in the spotlight and the cash prize.\n\n“We have introduced new categories this year which are, ‘Young SuperStar’, ‘Fundraising SuperStar’, ‘Unsung SuperStar’, ‘Community Group SuperStar’, ‘Social Enterprise SuperStar’, ‘SuperValu Action Cancer SuperStar’ and the ‘Overall SuperValu SuperStar 2018’.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“So, as well as identifying kids and adults who have done something remarkable or selfless we are rewarding the work done by people in the social enterprise sector, in community groups and we have introduced a special award for SuperValu colleagues who work tirelessly all year raising funds for Action Cancer.”\n\nFinalists will attend a prestigious ceremony in Titanic Hotel on November 22nd, hosted by TV personality, Pamela Ballantine, and each will receive SuperValu vouchers. The overall SuperValu SuperStar will walk away with £1000 for themselves and a £1000 donation to a registered charity of their choice.\n\nJudge and host of SuperValu SuperStars, Pamela Ballantine, said: “I\u0027m thrilled to be part of this amazing initiative which rewards those who are doing good in communities right across Northern Ireland. There is a lot of incredible work being done by individuals who work at social enterprise companies and community groups, as well as adults and kids, that goes completely unrewarded. We hope to shine a light on just some of these people and I can’t wait to meet all of our finalists on November 22 in the Titanic Hotel.”\n\nStephen Bogle, continued “Often in our society people don’t get the recognition they deserve SuperValu SuperStars will celebrate the contribution real life SuperStars make in our communities. Through this exciting initiative, we are proud to provide a platform to honour people and their organisations whose selflessness, commitment and determination make this such a great place to live.\n\n“We’re calling on everyone to get involved - if your friend, teacher, nurse, family member, neighbour, work colleague or someone in your community deserves recognition, this is your chance to give them their moment in the spotlight.”\n\nIt’s easy to nominate your SuperValu SuperStar – just log onto \nwww.supervalu\n and fill in the nomination form.\n\nSuperValu SuperStars media partners are The Sun and U105 and is sponsored by Denny, Action Cancer, Robinsons and Dove.\n\nFor further information and to nominate your local SuperStar, visit \nwww.supervalu\n.

They have also failed to engage through the formal negotiating structures with the trade unions.\n\n\u0026ldquoWhile the unions have had positive relations with some management of the legacy councils, it appears that the bad practice approach of others is now predominating.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe trade unions have offered a series of dates for talks with management at the Labour Relations Agency. Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

In fact Mr Hannaway has been disingenuous with his internal statements to the workforce, said Mr McMurray.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some ways I would expect that because if you are going to go to war, why wouldn\u0026rsquot you expect the other side to fight back?\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are waiting for genuine discussions which are open and honest.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
