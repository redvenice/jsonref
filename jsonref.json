But the risks to them if they do are far greater, with a higher likelihood of severe illness and potentially death. People of Asian ethnicity, predominantly South Asian in this study cohort, were almost twice as likely to test positive than those of white ethnicity.The finding is in line with mounting evidence that Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups (BAME) are being hit hardest by Covid-19. South Asians are 20 per cent more likely to die of after being admitted to hospital than white people, according to findings from University of Edinburgh last month. The prevalence of infection across in England was highest among care home workers, 0.71 per cent, followed by health care workers 0.47 per cent. This was seven to eight times higher than those who are not in a key worker role.Health and social care workers are more likely to be exposed to the coronavirus. And studies suggest healthcare workers from BAME backgrounds are twice as likely to catch coronavirus.The report also showed anyone who had recent contact with a known Covid-19 case was 24 times more likely to test positive than those with no such contact.\u0027Assuming that many of these contacts were work-related, these results suggest a continuing need for improved infection control in these settings,\u0027 the report said.It also emphasises the importance of contact tracing — seeking anyone who has been in close proximity to a positive Covid-19 case — in keeping the spread of the virus under control.The study will now undergo peer review before a final report is published, according to the Department of Health.Plans are currently underway for a second large-scale study, which will use antibody tests to determine how much of the general public has been infected with Covid-19 in the past.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Mother 21 claims Snapchat selfie proof home haunted spotting face old woman","story":"Share this article \u0027On Halloween last year we decorated the house and a boy came to our door trick or treating.\u0027He told us that our decorations were amazing and that he loved the creepy old woman upstairs in the window.\u0027After he left with his sweets I started thinking about what he said.

Jenny Stallard speaks to salon owner Melissa Timperley and pub chain boss Helen Charlesworth to find out how they’re keeping staff and customers safeMelissa Timperley is used to the demands of her clients as a salon owner. As a “treat” destination, she knows that everything – from the friendly welcome and the gown she puts around a customer’s shoulders, to the chocolate with their coffee – makes a visit to her eponymous hair salon a luxurious experience.And that isn’t changing just because of lockdown rules – in salons, restaurants, bars and shops, owners want their customers to feel special as they reopen in the “new normal”.Based in Manchester, Timperley’s three-floor salon recently had a makeover of its own, becoming a place of tape measures and screens, with every area considered for adaptation, from the reception desk to the basins, as it prepared to reopen.“I think salon owners have two really important jobs,” says Timperley. “They have, first and foremost, to keep their staff healthy and happy, and then they’ve got the job of keeping every single client healthy and happy.”Her first step was to see what other countries had been doing, in advance of any UK guidance. “The whole of lockdown has been a rollercoaster of emotions for most people, you have great days and bad days, and things get overwhelming. We researched what a lot of other countries were doing before our guidelines even came out,” says Timperley.Then, when the UK government did announce its own rules, specifically for England, it was a case of acting swiftly and safely to make some key decisions that worked for customers and staff. As the online appointment book filled up, she worked hard to make the salon accessible while still keeping that luxury feel.For Timperley, that has meant installing hand sanitiser stations and ordering new gowns. There will be branded face masks for those who want to wear them, although customers are not obliged to since staff will wear visors.There’s a huge emphasis on loyalty in the industry, where customers have been patient while they wait for news of appointments, and salon owners like Timperley want to show that’s appreciated, while also making sure her staff feel safe, too.“You’ve got to show that you’re doing the best for everybody. That means buying the best equipment, not cutting any corners,” she says. “We’ve staggered the appointments, we’re opening longer hours and we’re even opening on a Sunday to be able to service all our regular clients who’ve waited for us.”When the UK government announced that non-essential businesses in England could reopen on 4 July, many people were more than ready for a hair appointment, which shows the impact of not having these services around.Different salons needed to adapt in different ways. At Melissa Timperley, there is no “sharing” of clients, but at other salons that’s often not the case. For example, you may have visited a hairdresser and had your hair washed by one assistant, your cut done by your stylist and then the blow dry by another. Timperley’s salon has always been one-on-one with customers, which helped post-lockdown planning, as that needed to become the norm for all salons, according to UK government guidance.It’s a familiar scenario not just in salons but in pubs and restaurants across the country – wanting customers to feel valued and welcomed and staff to feel safe and appreciated, too – all while sticking to the guidelines laid out by the UK government.For Helen Charlesworth, managing director of the Stonegate pub company – which owns the Slug and Lettuce chain, among others – opening up has also been a “one day at a time” process. For the duration of lockdown, each day was one where she and the team planned for a future where they could reopen.Helping staff feel connected was a priority, she says, and a lot of time also went into ensuring the chain had a robust “closedown” manual. “We’ve never in our time had to close down an entire pub chain before. So we learned quite a lot, and we felt it would be good to document our learnings and have a precise manual. I’m glad we did as we’ve had to activate that in Leicester,” she adds, referring to the city that became subject to the UK’s first local lockdown on 30 June.The company furloughed a lot of team members, and then faced the task of ensuring their mental and physical health was kept in good shape. “We communicated with our people every day throughout the lockdown process, then once they went on to furlough we’ve had a very robust communication programme led by our CEO Simon Longbottom. He’s done twice weekly calls with the teams, video calls, kept everyone abreast of what’s going on.“We’ve had various groups raising money for charity. Lots of teams of people within Stonegate who have felt looked after and felt part of the Stonegate family have been out there raising cash for employees and families affected by Covid-19, the NHS and charities,” explains Charlesworth.Stonegate has an intranet hub where it could upload everything from key messages to quizzes and games. “Hundreds of different articles and things you can do whilst you’re off and we kept that updated,” adds Charlesworth.Keeping in touch with staff, both Charlesworth and Timperley agree, was key during lockdown so they felt valued and knew what was happening with the business.And what about the rules when the doors do open? Your haircut or that fancy G\u0026ampT will now come with a side serving of screens and socially-distanced chairs.“Customers don’t have to book a slot, but we are taking bookings in all our pubs, just so that people have got somewhere to come in and sit down and it’s easier because then we’re capturing customer data at the booking point,” says Charlesworth.“If you come to the pub and you haven’t booked, you’ll have to scan a QR code and put your details on to a website and we have to keep those details for 21 days,” she says.“The wonderful thing about hospitality, it’s pretty much a vocation rather than a job for people and it’s their way of life, and their customers end up being their friends, so it is quite sad and difficult for them to be at home and not be part of that. When they have come back it’s like walking into the unknown.”Part of the reopening has been a video filmed in one of Stonegate’s Manchester venues, showing staff how things would look and operate. “What we’ve done is we’ve tried to take away any level of anxiety,” she explains.The distancing has depended on which areas they were dealing with, she adds.“Where it’s outside we’ve tried to stick to a 2-metre rule, whereas when it’s inside we’ve tried to use screens, PPE and back-to-back tables. We’ve tried to be a bit more strategic and play around with what the layout looks like. We’ve spoken to all our authorities and they seem pretty happy with what we’ve done.”Hair salons, restaurants and pubs may be something you take for granted. Well, took for granted. Now they’re reopening, operators such as Timperley and Charlesworth feel this is their chance to showcase their new, and often improved, offerings.Timperley says: “Everything that we’ve had to do differently, we’ve done better. For example, the disposable towels are the nicest I could get, and the gowns are scented with vanilla. We’ve tried to keep the luxury touches and as soon as we can introduce more back in, even if we can do a coffee in a disposable cup, that would make it feel nicer again. But I think people will just be so grateful to have their hair done, you know ... what I think has happened is people have tried cutting their hair at home and colouring their hair at home, and they realise how talented hairdressers are!“I think the biggest challenge has been remaining positive in lockdown when everything around you is negative. For me, keeping the staff upbeat and the clients informed. Everything has been extra work.”This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

Our writer, who was at the dawn unveiling, tells the full story of its creation – and speaks to Jen Reid, the protester whose gesture so inspired him There’s a lookout stationed at the end of Colston Street and a load of people, some dressed in hi-vis vests, are gathering at a nearby restaurant. Then, in the dawn light, a statue concealed in plastic wrapping can be seen approaching on a hiab truck. It turns the corner and reverses towards the plinth where the statue of Edward Colston once stood. There’s a sense of mischief in the air on this bright clear morning in Bristol – and revolution.The team spring into action and, minutes later, a new statue has been placed on the spot where Colston’s stood and swiftly unwrapped. It’s of a young black woman, her fist raised in a black power salute. “There’s a new woman in power!” a cyclist shouts as he turns the bend. On Twitter, responses start coming in fast. Dr Lola Solebo writes: “Am waking my girls up early so I can show them this. What a thing of beauty. What a thing to wake up to.”Another woman is standing by the plinth. “I feel full of pride, so so full of pride,” she says, looking up at the sculpture. It’s of herself.Rewind a few weeks and this same woman is knocking at the door of an artist’s studio, dressed in a face mask. She’s hurried in and asked to stand on a podium, with her legs slightly apart and her fist in the air. She’s re-enacting the black power salute she made on the plinth of Edward Colston’s statue on 7 June, just after protesters pulled the slave-trader’s likeness down. A hi-tech, 3D scanning machine whirrs into life, its 201 cameras capturing her defiant pose, and every thread of her clothes, which are the same ones she wore on that tumultuous Sunday.The woman’s name is Jen Reid and this scene was taking place in the studio of artist Marc Quinn. And now today, Reid stands once again on that plinth, but rendered in black resin – Quinn’s own guerrilla-style response to the much debated question of what should replace the statue, which ended up in the waters of Bristol harbour.It’s an extraordinarily powerful sight, the early morning light reflecting on the smooth, ebony surface of the statue, which has just been placed on the plinth. The sense of triumph in the air finds a perfect echo in Reid’s pose. That fist, balled up and thrown into the air, exerting energy into the heavens and casting the psychological pressure of systemic racism into the ether, calling for action and for others to stand with her, with us. From the coils of her afro to the wrinkles in her skin as she clenches her fist, the emotion is potent and palpable.It all began with a post on Instagram by @biggiesnug, showing Reid on the plinth with the caption: “My wife. My life. She matters.” The post was soon liked by @marcquinnart, Quinn’s Instagram account and, after a lot of organising, this powerful moment was recreated in his studio: first 3D-printed in sections, then cast in resin, before being meticulously put together by Quinn’s team of craftsmen. “Posing for the sculpture,” says Reid, “brought back all the memories of getting on the plinth. The feelings and emotions. I felt powerful.”The toppling of Colston’s statue gave the Black Lives Matter movement a moment of symbolism that will reverberate for years. As George Floyd’s last words – “I can’t breathe” – ricocheted around the world, Bristol protesters took to the streets with a newfound energy. Two protesters leapt up with a length of rope, others pulled and soon Colston, who had glared down at the city since 1895, was gone. Reid’s stand instantly felt as if it should be part of our visual lexicon, a vital piece of the history lesson about slavery long overdue in Britain. Quinn agrees.“Racism,” the artist says, “is a huge problem, a virus that needs to be addressed. I hope this sculpture will continue that dialogue, keep it in the forefront of people’s minds, be an energy conductor. The image created by Jen that day – when she stood on the plinth with all the hope of the future of the world flowing through her – made the possibility of greater change feel more real than it has before.”Quinn, who has called his work A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020, continues: “When I saw the picture of Jen on Instagram, I immediately thought it would be great to immortalise that moment. The image is a silhouette: she looked like a sculpture already. I’ve been making portraits of refugees using 3D scanning over the last year and applied the same technology to this.”The Instagram image shows Reid’s outline against the grey Bristol sky, with cardboard signs scattered around the plinth, which has been covered in graffiti. One sign reads: “He who accepts evil without protesting against it is co-operating with it.” Perhaps this message touched Quinn? As a celebrated white male artist, he could be criticised for inserting himself into the debate. He recalls a quote from Desmond Tutu: “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.” The artist adds: “White people in positions of power need to speak up and support change in the way black people are treated, their positions in society. I have been listening and learning and one of the phrases that really struck me was, ‘White silence is violence.’”Quinn is no newcomer to plinths. In 2004, he became the first artist to be commissioned for the fourth plinth in London’s Trafalgar Square, placing Alison Lapper Pregnant on the vacant site, a statue of the artist who was born without arms and with shortened legs. “The sculpture contributed to moving the narrative around disability forward in the UK,” Quinn says. “The great thing about the public realm is that it is very democratic and accessible. Museums can be very elite spaces. This reaches everyone.”On the subject of whether white artists should write these stories, Reid says: “I wanted to do this with Marc Quinn as he’s always cared about pushing inclusion to the forefront and making people think. It’s not about black or white. If people want to stand by me, that’s great.”The statue of Colston was created by a white man, John Cassidy, to commemorate a white slave-trader. Now the plinth is occupied by the work of a white artist who feels duty bound to correct the situation, to amplify voices that have been silenced for so long. It’s reminiscent of US film-maker Bree Newsome’s athletic act of protest. In 2015, Newsome scaled a flagpole to remove the Confederate flag hanging in the South Carolina state house grounds. She told the Washington Post: “We needed somebody who could help me over the fence. Be a lookout. We decided it should be a white man ... because we wanted to communicate it’s not just the role of the people who are oppressed, but it’s also on the people who have benefited from oppression who have to be part of the process.”Many have described finding the Colston statue an affront to the black citizens of Bristol. “Having to see that statue daily does something to you,” says Reid. “Knowing what Colston represented, I felt compelled to take a stand and raise my fist in empowerment for the slaves who died at his hands. It was like an electrical surge of power was running through me as I took the plinth in memory of George Floyd, and for every black person killed by police for being black, and those who face injustice daily based on the colour of their skin.”She pauses and adds: “To those who are listening, keep talking, keep righting wrongs when you see them. Keep educating those that want to listen. Unlike Black History Month, I hope this statue addresses blackness every day.”The question of removing the Colston statue was not a new one. Petitions had been signed, meetings had been held. The artist Hew Locke, in his 2006 series Restoration, introduced his own response. In a photographic work called Colston, Locke covered the statue in trinkets, beads and cowrie shells, which were used as currency to trade slaves.In terms of getting Quinn’s sculpture on to the plinth, the project took on a Mission Impossible feel. NDAs were signed, late-night rendezvous arranged. Quinn has not received permission to put the sculpture up, but he is also not breaking any laws. His team transported the artwork from the workshop on a truck with a built-in crane to lift it up on to the plinth. The bottom of the sculpture is designed to sit securely without drilling, gluing or damage to the plinth. In many ways, proceeding without permission makes this a special sort of art anarchism, entering the realm of activism.How will people react? How will the police react? Quinn says a big motivation for the project is to spark debate, keep the attention on this vital issue, and see how everyone reacts. “I guess that includes the authorities, too,” he says.The philosopher Jürgen Habermas wrote about how institutions and nations suffer an erosion of legitimacy over time if they do not robustly interrogate themselves. Perhaps statues should be part of this interrogation. Monuments, after all, are symbols of the systems we live in. Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 is like a modern Statue of Liberty. Indeed, Lady Liberty was originally designed to celebrate freed slaves. In the US, statues continue to fall. This replacement by Quinn and Reid should hopefully catalyse a call for action, for a new world, for a new sculptural legacy. Today, as Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 stands on its plinth, the Colston statue sits on a concrete floor in a wooden container locked up by the council, covered in scratches from where it was dragged across the asphalt, hands and face spray-painted red for blood. That’s karma for you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0411308a3798d42993b5f6480640b35b93691a5/0_118_3142_1886/master/3142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bfa01ac6baf86e149220ff6c12a569f","title":"next generation magnum photographers","story":"From crime-scene torsos to the tension of a chess game – this new wave of photographic talent set out their vision"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31cec769f657f13ee1a0e5c57f4343a0f69a0930/1131_335_2731_1638/master/2731.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b516ee14812807d96c3365c6665821b3","title":"uk inflation rises as game console prices increase in lockdown coronavirus","story":"UK inflation has risen for the first time this year, fuelled by the rising price of games consoles during lockdown and a lack of summer sales on the high street.The ONS said clothing prices had not followed the standard seasonal pattern this year because of the impact of the coronavirus crisis, with the usual summer sales failing to materialise as much of the high street was closed.

This should maintain a downward pressure on inflation, which could fall further, especially if there is a spike in unemployment later this year.”Inflation has been driven down during the pandemic by a falling global oil price and fading demand for goods and services as businesses temporarily ceased trading and furloughed millions of workers. Although the oil price has risen again and shops, restaurants and pubs have begun to reopen, a sharp rise in the cost of living is not expected.Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “We suspect that after the initial release of pent-up demand once non-essential retailers opened in mid-June, retailers will have to use heavier discounts to get people through the doors.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5910dd9f0183a3adc6dff0d4fc715efa4f67b783/280_0_2674_1605/master/2674.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa33887bc10c6b2b2e0be37ca4810f9a","title":"uk launches first online service for groceries in reusable packing","story":"Loop will offer 150 products from major brands in refillable containers, with more to followThe UK’s first online shopping service that delivers food, drink and household essentials from leading brands in reusable packaging is to launch on Wednesday, aiming to kickstart moves to reduce single use plastic that stalled as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.Loop – already established in the US and France and due to be rolled out to Japan, Australia and Canada next year – is one of the most ambitious attempts yet to eliminate plastic waste from the household shop. It is backed by major consumer goods companies such as Unilever and PepsiCo, who have created eco-versions of popular brands – including Coca-Cola, Heinz and Persil – to sell via the website.Customers can place online orders for goods that normally come in single-use plastic packaging. They will be delivered instead in durable, refillable containers that can be collected from the doorstep and cleaned for reuse up to 100 times. Heinz’s tomato ketchup, for example, will be delivered in its patented glass octagonal bottles which were designed 130 years ago.The new service, which is billed as the “milkman reimagined”, aims to change the way households shop and consume amid concern about the global single-use plastic binge.At the start, 150 products from 35 major brands will be on offer, with more to be added. At first shoppers will only be able to buy from the Loop website but a partnership with Tesco – which will absorb the platform into its own business – aims to eventually put dedicated aisles in its stores.The Loop scheme is run by the recycling company TerraCycle, which is initially testing it in a major national trial. Key to the scheme is online ordering, which has surged since the outbreak of the pandemic.Prices will be comparable to the equivalent plastic container, but with returnable deposits for the refillable containers.Progress in reducing single-use plastics in the UK has stalled since the outbreak of coronavirus, due to the increased use of masks, gloves, visors and disposable wipes amid fears of contamination and as recycling rates plummeted during lockdown."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891531437924319e49d2ae588380ab9627d56399/0_125_5220_3131/master/5220.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=994e2599bbb684fc5a85cd478f7e07bb","title":"face masks england second wave leaders","story":"Wearing face coverings protects us, protects others – and could help prevent a second wave. Yet our leaders have dithered againAfter going around in circles about the merits of face coverings for months, England has made them mandatory in shops from 24 July. Just like the delays and endless commentary in March and April about whether testing, tracing and isolating is important during a pandemic, whether travel restrictions can help prevent the importation of Covid-19 cases and whether lockdowns are necessary, the media and government have spent months prevaricating about face coverings before finally accepting that England has little choice but to follow others’ lead.The UK government has learned a painful lesson during the coronavirus pandemic: the most difficult thing about controlling outbreaks isn’t knowing what to do, but actually doing it. Take testing, for example. Already by early March the World Health Organization had made it clear that testing, tracing and isolating carriers of the virus was the best way to control outbreaks. In the words of its director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” Yet it took England until the end of April to deliver on its testing target. Even now, we don’t know the true number of people who have been tested – as the government has stopped making this information publicly available.Controlling outbreaks requires clear leadership that sets out a coherent strategy and compels advisers to shift from conversations about “what needs to be done” to “how best to achieve it”. By the time many other European countries had made face coverings compulsory, UK cabinet ministers seemed incapable of forming a consensus on the right response. On Friday, Boris Johnson hinted that a change in advice on face masks was coming – but Michael Gove then told Andrew Marr that wearing masks should be a matter of “basic good manners”.What observational studies such as these have made clear is that face coverings play an important role in protecting the wearer from infection, and preventing an infected wearer, if wearing a mask, from transmitting the virus. No one wants to see cases rise, or to have a second lockdown. The clear message should be: I wear a mask to protect you, and you wear a mask to protect me. The director general of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said the biggest mistake made in Europe and the US was that people didn’t wear masks from the start.Making face coverings mandatory, rather than voluntary, is about reaching a “tipping point” where the majority of people start to comply with this guidance. If one person is wearing a mask in a shop and nobody else is, that one person feels out of place. The social norm then becomes not to wear a mask. But if the same person walks into a shop and everyone else is wearing a mask, they will feel awkward and uncomfortable not having one. Of course, some iniduals, such as those who have breathing difficulties, won’t find it easy to wear a mask. We shouldn’t be shaming people for not wearing masks, as we don’t know the full circumstances.As lockdown measures are eased, a careful balance must be maintained between reducing transmission of Covid-19 and supporting businesses and the economy by shopping, moving around cities on public transport, and getting back to daily life as much as possible. This virus spreads through droplets escaping from noses and mouths from speaking, coughing, sneezing and loud breathing. And these droplets can even become airborne, as the WHO has recently acknowledged. Masks can therefore play an important role in stopping droplets from infectious iniduals reaching other people. According to scientific studies, outdoor transmission seems minimal. The real challenge is to stop transmission within indoor settings, where iniduals are in close contact with limited ventilation for a prolonged period of time, such as in shops, pubs and restaurants. Compounding this challenge is the role that presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission – where an infected person spreads the virus before they develop symptoms themselves, or where they never develop symptoms – can play in spreading the disease. Relying only on those with symptoms of coronavirus to self-isolate is not enough to stop transmission given the role that these silent carriers play in its spread.When the Scottish government made face coverings mandatory in shops from 10 July, the general reaction from the public was one of acceptance and relief – especially from people who work in shops and those who are anxious about becoming infected. Wearing a face covering while indoors, particularly when distancing may be difficult, seemed a small price to pay to avoid a second wave of coronavirus cases and reverse the progress made to contain the virus. Other countries, particularly some in Asia, will have been puzzled by why England took so long to make such a simple, low-cost decision.• Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7c70e32cb7896f4327eea9178dc87b674491aa75/0_272_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ae07ed76868c0960ab644e2f1eb03cc","title":"the secret of my hard won mindfulness a bargain bag of beauty","story":"I’ve found inner peace contemplating everything from my mate’s Ford Escort to the skies above. But enlightenment has come from a most unusual sourceI knew that mindfulness, like green tea and sauerkraut, would be good for me, but I always found it a struggle. It would all start promisingly enough, with the honeyed tones of the guy on the tape telling me to concentrate on nothing at all, or my breathing, or both, or something. He would then tell me to forgive myself if my mind wandered and, without self-recrimination, to merely escort my thoughts back to my breathing.That was such a sweet way of expressing it, and I would feel great peace as I reflected on the cleverness of his use of the word “escort”. I would turn the word over in my mind and remember my friend Lee’s Ford Escort XR2 and the time we drove to a pub in Chaddesley Corbett, and Jim said something funny, and one of us was sick, and so on. But then I would realise what I was doing and, without recrimination, escort this thought about an Escort back to my breathing.And so it went on. The problem is that by the time the first minute had ticked by, I had already escorted my thoughts thousands of miles, back and forth through time and space. If I got as far as 10 minutes of this, it felt less like escorting than wrestling as I frantically tried to herd the cats of my thoughts back to my quickening breaths.The one thing the nice man said that really did hit home was something like: “We take the view that as long as you’re still breathing, there’s more right with you than is wrong.” I love that. It is a short, simple, positive thought that we will all, literally until our dying moments, have at our disposal. And I have kind of built on it, realising that it’s no good banging on all the time about the importance of stillness without working out how to find any.Happily, I have now chanced upon a method that does seem to work for me. I can only do it while walking, so I am not sure if it really counts, but it is a start. It grew out of a rather brilliant little attention-training exercise my pleasingly strict cognitive behavioural therapist commanded me to do. This involved identifying five noises around you and focusing on each of them for a minute, then shuffling rapidly between them for a total of three minutes, and finally trying to take them all in at once for two minutes. I generally went for the sounds of a clock ticking, an outside noise, tinnitus and some white noise effect on my phone. For the fifth sound, if nothing else suggested itself, I would choose my own breathing, running the risk that I would start thinking about Lee’s Ford Escort again, but I normally got away with it.My walking version of this – which cannot be an original idea, I know – involves observing different things as I proceed. All urban walks present six things to be absorbed by and, for a minute each, I look at the ground then trees and bushes man-made things such as buildings, bins and bollards people and animals road vehicles and trains and, finally, the sky. There is always interest, if not beauty, in each category. I now do this all the time, and it is making me more mindful with every step.Only yesterday, I can relate with Pooterish relish, I went to buy some gravel from a builders’ merchant to top-dress some potted plants I went for the 20mm, since you ask. It looked most unpromising, all grey, brown and dirty in its thick plastic sack. But when I got home and washed them down, every stone in there turned out to be, upon even cursory examination, a thing of astonishing beauty. It will take me ages to appreciate every single one of them. So much mindful happiness in one £3.40 bag of gravel. Bargain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca9ea5db0549a82dce227222b37a63543adfdc3c/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc734cc09dffc0efbd79f4eb00abfb34","title":"brazil meat plants linked to spread of covid 19","story":"Conditions at plants contributed to transmission of virus, experts say, as country remains second only to US for deathsBrazilian meat plants helped spread Covid-19 in at least three different places across the country as the virus continues to migrate from big cities to the country’s vast interior, experts have said.The conditions can create perfect Covid-19 breeding centres, said Priscila Schvarcz, a prosecutor from the Public Ministry of Labour (MPT), a branch of the federal prosecution service charged with supervising labour laws.“We see a lot of workers infected,” said Schvarcz, a member of a national meat plant taskforce based in Rio Grande do Sul state in southern Brazil.Rio Grande do Sul has been hard hit. As of 23 June, 4,957 meat workers had tested positive at 32 plants in the state – a third of the total coronavirus cases in the area, prosecutors said. Five employees and 12 people in contact with them had died.A study for the MPT showed that Covid-19 cases in central and southern Brazil were clustered around towns where meat plants were located and workers lived. “There is a direct relationship,” said Ernesto Galindo, the researcher who produced the study. China, Brazil’s biggest trading partner, suspended imports of meat from plants owned by two of Brazil’s largest meat companies, BRF and JBS, at the beginning of this month. Brazil’s ministry of agriculture also suspended exports from a JBS plant in Rio Grande do Sul, business daily Valor said.BRF said it was working with the Brazilian and Chinese authorities to resume deliveries. The company said that 98 of 2,873 workers at its plant in Lajeado, Rio Grande do Sul, tested positive in late May. JBS did not comment on China’s suspension of imports.The JBS plant in Dourados “was the initial focus for the outbreak”, said Andyane Tetila, an infectious diseases specialist in Dourados who works for the state health service. The JBS plant has 103 indigenous workers, many of whom live in nearby reserves where more than 150 people were subsequently infected, said Indianara Machado, an indigenous nurse who works in the reserve.JBS said it had put all its indigenous workers on paid leave and is supporting initiatives to control and prevent new coronavirus outbreaks in more than 100 municipalities across Brazil. Labour prosecutors said JBS moved quickly to contain the outbreak. “The company collaborated,” said Jeferson Pereira, a labour prosecutor in Dourados. “It contracted nurses and technicians to accompany visits.”Another 85 people tested positive at a BRF plant in the town. The company said workers in this situation are suspended on pay, given medical attention and monitored by occupational health specialists at the company until they recover.In June, a judge closed a JBS plant in the remote Amazon town of São Miguel do Guaporé in the north-west of Brazil for the second time after infections rocketed. As of 25 June, 377 of the plant’s 940 employees were infected – then more than half of the town’s caseload, prosecutors said.Leandro da Conceição, 33, one of the workers in the plant, said he lost his sense of smell and taste. When he told his supervisor, he was ignored and kept working even though he got sicker and sicker.“It reached a point I couldn’t stand it any more. I told my superior I was not well,” he told the . “His focus was the cows, not the employees, it was production.”Conceição was sent home after he produced his own positive test result. He and another worker later lost their jobs after a WhatsApp audio that featured them and other workers complaining about infections at the plant was published by local media. Both men were told falling production was the motive. “They had no reason to sack us,” he said. “I never missed work.”Local labour prosecutor Helena Romero said: “We realised that the company was not carrying out containment measures, we observed that often workers kept working even though they had symptoms, and this could have contributed to spreading the illness.” The plant has since reopened.After the outbreak in Lajeado, BRF signed an extrajudicial deal with labour prosecutors. The company said it had tested 31,000 employees nationwide in the past two months. Four of its plants had closed for testing and all 34 are now operating. Preventative measures included reducing bus capacity by half and suspending workers in Covid-19 risk groups. A permanent committee of specialists monitors its actions.JBS – the world’s biggest meat company – has not signed any agreements with prosecutors. Court orders have imposed temporary shutdowns and in some cases testing at three of its plants in Rio Grande do Sul. On 23 June, a judge ordered all workers to be tested at a fourth JBS plant in the state. All have since reopened, prosecutors said.JBS did not explain why it had no agreements with labour prosecutors and declined to comment on outbreaks at inidual plants. “JBS does not comment on legal decisions,” it said.The company said that the health and safety of its team members was its key priority. It had adopted a strict protocol on control, prevention and safety at all processing units, in full compliance with government-mandated rules. JBS said it followed guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization as well “specialised physicians”. “Each test assessment takes place on a case-by-case basis,” the company said. It disinfected factories daily and takes workers’ temperatures, and has increased its fleet of buses and put those in risk groups and anyone with symptoms on paid leave."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ca33762ac59357b0d6bca0d48046003c71a97c1/0_169_4444_2666/master/4444.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ca97ed9673cc6091fbd78d10f065f175","title":"the meaning of pampering in a post lockdown world","story":"As we ease back into normal life salon treatments are comforting – but there’s a chance they will never feel the same againI was so keen for my post-lockdown trim last Saturday that I arrived at George Northwood’s salon just off London’s Oxford Street 20 minutes early. At the check-in point, instead of offering me a coffee, they took my temperature. I felt a brief jolt of greedy disappointment, because in the old days you used to get a tiny bar of chocolate with your coffee. But I was still so happy to be there that I made a terrible joke about being cool enough to come in, which the receptionist kindly pretended to laugh at from behind his visor.I hate the word “pampering”, with its frilly talcum-powder overtones. (“Grooming” is even worse. What is this, Crufts?) And yet I was thrilled when I put that hair appointment in my still-barren diary. And while I’m typing this article with overgrown cuticles, that is only because my local beauty salon is fully booked for manicures and pedicures till later this week. The reopening of hairdressers and beauty salons has been a landmark moment, not just for a workforce estimated between 150,000 and 200,000 people, but for many, like me, who have rejoiced in the novelty of being back in the treatment chair, despite being under no illusions about the true relative importance of the perfect post-salon hair or shiny new nails.Elliot, my stylist at George Northwood, told me while he chopped away that getting back to work had felt “like a real honour. So many clients have said to me that their first time back in the salon has been the moment when it felt like they were getting a little bit of their old life back.” Despite the plastic screens and the disposable gowns, the mood in the salon was cheery and oddly comforting. The polite ritual checking of water temperature, just in case madam is in a particularly fussy mood. The staccato blast of hairspray that signals the end of a session.And yet for all the current enthusiasm, the beauty industry may never return to anything like the old normal. The extended lockdown forced many who were in the habit of outsourcing beauty treatments to hone DIY skills. I have learned from bitter experience that home hair colouring ends in tears. (One word: khaki.) Therefore, I had no choice but to live with mouse roots and blond split ends through May and June. But I dabbled in seven-day foot peel socks. (Too revolting to discuss in public, DM me for details.) And in despair at eyebrow threading treatments still being off limits – a harsh and seemingly sexist line having been drawn which disallows a treatment where both parties can wear a mask, but permits beard trims, for which the client cannot – I have just ordered an eyebrow epilator.Many beauty treatments – manicures, spray tans, blow-dries – are about painting on a topcoat of polish with which to face the world. They are armour for life in meatspace. But with life having contracted to the size of a bubble, perhaps that armour is no longer necessary. Many people are still working from home, cooking instead of eating out. There are no parties, except on Zoom, and there’s a beauty filter for that. Many people who used to see themselves as outward-facing, economically-engaged citizens now feel more domestic instead. (If your pre-pandemic takeout coffee expenditure strikes you as a financial lunacy you are determined not to slide back into, then I’m talking about you.) Now that our colleagues have been behind the scenes of our lives as we Zoom from the kitchen table, is there any need to get back into stage makeup, even when we are back at our desks?But beauty means so much more than makeup and manicures. An industry of commodified attractiveness is connected, even if with a dotted line, to beauty with a capital B. And the pandemic has not been pretty. Now, clearly, no one’s primary objection to a virus that has killed half a million people is aesthetic. The point I am making is that this has been an ugly time, literally, as well as metaphorically – and so, by the laws of physics, we long for the opposite. The optics of the past few months have been bleak, jarring and unfiltered. (Rishi Sunak is, of course, the honourable exception, but apart from him.) Think of the yellow and black stripes of official messaging campaigns, with their wasp-sting associations the one-way arrows and taped-off sections that make every public space feel like a building site. On one day towards the end of lockdown when I was feeling particularly low, I walked into my nearest Sainsbury’s Local – not the Uffizi to start off with – and the sheer visual assault of hazard tape and barricades almost did me in.After the blinding heatwave that accompanied the adrenaline-surge of lockdown drama, even the weather now seems to reflect our uncertainty, a certain instability of mood. Peering out into this strange twilight summer, we crave light. Remember that it was a rainbow, not a virus emoji, that became the symbol of this strange season. We are all craving beauty. And we are grateful to get it anywhere we can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b89e74e549764386b3a434cc2f9c143f45b061a/0_175_6049_3630/master/6049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b364878e4df7e0ce7af43d1ca2bdc9d","title":"collaborations backstage films and a pop up show paris mens digital fashion week in pictures","story":"The global pandemic saw the springsummer 2021 Paris menswear shows delayed but they still went ahead, online.

Whether it would be worth corralling everybody in an enclosed public space for that time and thereby risking the lives of you and yours will have to be a matter for inidual consumers to decide.Its strongest selling point is the animation itself. As we follow pre-teen Minna into the hinterland of her own dreams – her fantasies and nightmares are conjured up by a cast of Smurf-blue tin men – it’s apparent that directors Kim Hagen Jensen and Tonni Zinck have granted animators Hydralab an appreciably loose rein. To wit: a network of “dreamstages” (think soundstages for sleep) connected by a rattly, gravity-defying funfair infrastructure – not unlike the Monsters, Inc assembly line, but extended further out into abstract space. The world-building is a cut above the film’s character design, which proves rather more beholden to the wide-eyed Disney-Pixar template, without its expressive range.Elsewhere, there are the usual shortfalls of imported animated content. Any sharpness of angle in the original concept – like Minna’s realisation she can infiltrate her snippy, Insta-obsessed stepsister’s reveries and make her a better person – soon gets dulled by blunt translation and bland redubbing. If you just wanted to plonk everyone down in front of pretty shapes and colours for 80 minutes, then Dreambuilders will serve you on the same level as the loop-the-loops of last year’s equally middling Wonder Park – but then that movie had the advantage of releasing before the emergence of a lethal airborne virus. • Dreambuilders is in cinemas from 17 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9cd8b0a0f78a4be0b6b2585be8a870b825737ef/0_2340_4912_2944/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fad78307c2dd7e49b08a5b1d3ec4419b","title":"17 dips arent hummus humungous salsa guacamole taramasalata baba ganoush","story":"Go on, branch out. From salsas and guacamole to taramasalata and baba ganoush, there is no need to stop at the simple, reliable chickpeaIf you want hummus, by all means make some, or better yet, buy some – it’s better from the shop. But if you’re looking to branch out a little, there are thousands of other dips out there, suitable for the dunking of raw or roasted vegetables, flatbreads, tortilla chips, a pointy leaf or almost any other foodstuff sturdy enough to serve as a makeshift spoon.Some of the dips below may also qualify as sauces, dressings or marinades. We will not detain ourselves over definitions – if it can be consumed as a dip, it counts. Yotam Ottolenghi’s spinach with strained yoghurt and chilli butter illustrates the possibility for confusion – it’s probably best described as an accompaniment when served warm, and a dip at room temperature. Likewise his avocado and broad bean concoction could more precisely be considered a spread, but this largely depends on the presence or absence of a knife at the table.We might, however, categorise dips based on the things you dip into them. Under “crisps, tortilla chips or similar” we would probably start with guacamole. A strict recipe isn’t necessary – it’s just avocado, onion, garlic, chilli, lime juice, coriander and salt, in quantities largely based on personal preference – but Dave Bry makes his using what he calls the “ceviche method” , which he guarantees is superior.The dip we often call just plain salsa, which is perhaps more accurately known as pico de gallo (“cockerel’s beak”), is a similar collation of raw ingredients, swapping the avocados for chopped tomatoes. Felicity Cloake’s masterclass version makes a controversial, but sensible substitution: spring onions are used instead of red or yellow ones in a bid to mimic the flavour of the traditional white onion, which is hard to come by in the UK.Salsa verde is pico de gallo’s green cousin, using tomatillos in place of tomatoes, and is not to be confused with the other salsa verde – a garlic, mustard and green herb sauce traditionally served with roasted meats. Tomatillos look like little tomatoes but they’re actually a sort of physalis, and you can find them in speciality shops if you want to be authentic. If not, you can try the physalis they sell occasionally in supermarkets – AKA cape gooseberries – in which case your salsa verde will be more yellowy-orange than green. When they’re around I often mix physalis with tomatoes in salsa, in a ratio of roughly three of the latter to one of the former. The difference in flavour is fairly subtle, but the colour is impressive.Here’s another variation requiring little in the way of effort: roasted salsa. It’s all the same stuff, but you whack the main ingredients under the grill first until they start to blister. Allow them to cool, then pulse together in a mixer, adding lime juice salt and coriander.Dips made to be scooped with veg – radishes, celery, carrots, chicory leaves – include the classic blue cheese dip, for which Cloake recommends gorgonzola whizzed with cream cheese, sour cream, garlic and chives, and cut with a splash of cider vinegar. It’s pretty well guaranteed to spoil your appetite for supper. You might not even make it as far as supper, which is, in a very real sense, a problem solved.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s yoghurt, dill and caper dip is a more summery offering that comes together with a gentle stir, while this whipped feta and sumac dip from Clare Thomson achieves a kind of midpoint in consistency between the other two – half feta, half yoghurt – which can be served with either veg or flatbread.Taramasalata is another classic dip served with bread, but which may itself contain bread, depending on the recipe. This is partly because the chief ingredient, smoked cod’s roe, is expensive, but the addition of bread doesn’t just stretch amounts – according to Nigel Slater it also leavens the texture agreeably.Baba ganoush is a versatile dip with a single disadvantage: it lacks immediacy. You have to bake the aubergine for about 45 minutes, by which time you could have produced and consumed several other dips. Jamie Oliver’s recipe keeps things otherwise simple. Anna Jones’s borani deploys beetroot to similar effect.There are a number of dips that are not technically hummus because the chickpeas have been replaced by some other kind of pea or bean. Rosie Birkett’s white bean dip is one of these. The pea hummus (it’s not hummus) in this recipe from reader Natalie Wong pairs frozen peas with thyme and almond butter. You can also fashion a hummus-like dip from lentils, like this one from Bon Appetit, or even sweet potato.Finally there is the all-time American classic, French onion dip. The traditional method produces the simplest dip ever, and to the unacquainted, possibly the most off-putting: you stir a packet of proprietary dried French onion soup mix – as it comes – into a quantity of sour cream. That’s it, and it’s delicious served with raw veg or heavy, ridged crisps. Some people add a little mayonnaise, but purists will keep to the two ingredients listed the recipe on the back of the soup mix box. Instructions are hardly required, and I link to them here only so you know I’m not making this up.Unfortunately, the key ingredient is not readily available in the UK (although you can order the Knorr version, which appears to be popular on the continent). It is possible to make a passable version of this dip from scratch, and although that really isn’t the point, I suppose it cannot hurt to try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29ccd72ff7bf4ef8c876f8971c3509f0203ff4f8/1148_1780_5066_3038/master/5066.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db6e4af4910a4d2a6b41ba34257f3c4b","title":"how to make goan seafood curry recipe felicity cloake","story":"A step-by-step guide to making this classic, aromatic, tangy fish curry One of the world’s great fish dishes, Goan-style seafood curry is, like the region’s infamous vindaloo, spicy in the truest sense: deeply aromatic, rather than merely hot, with chillies playing second fiddle to the almost mentholated sweetness of cloves and star anise. Refreshingly tangy, thanks to the local fondness for vinegar, it’s perfect warm-weather fare.For the masala1 tsp cloves1 tbsp coriander seeds1 tsp cumin seeds8 dried red Kashmiri chillies2 star anise½ tsp turmeric1 tsp salt5 garlic cloves3cm piece fresh root ginger1 tbsp palm sugar (see step 2)1½ tbsp white vinegarFor the curry1 onion3 tbsp vegetable oil1 large tomato1 x 400ml tin coconut milk2 fresh green chillies400g firm white fish (eg, pollock)200g prawns (shelled weight, see step 6)½ tsp mustard seeds10 curry leavesCoriander leaves, to garnishFor the masala, or spice mix, toast the cloves, coriander and cumin seeds, dried chillies and star anise in a hot, dry frying pan until you can really smell them, then crush them to a powder in a mortar or spice grinder. Stir in the turmeric and salt.Peel and crush the garlic cloves, and peel and finely grate the ginger, then stir both into the spice mix, along with the sugar – if your palm sugar comes in a solid block, crush this in the mortar, too (if you can’t find palm sugar, soft brown sugar makes a decent, though not exact, substitute). Finally, stir in the vinegar to make a smooth paste.Peel and finely chop the onion. Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large, wide pan over a medium heat, then gently saute the onion until soft and lightly golden, stirring to make sure it doesn’t catch and burn. Meanwhile, grate the tomato, discarding the skin (don’t worry about any small bits that get into the pulp).Add the masala mix to the pan and cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, until you can smell the spices again (be careful not to get too close: hot vinegar can irritate the eyes!), then stir in the grated tomato and continue to cook until most of the liquid has evaporated and the pan is fairly dry.Slowly add the coconut milk, stirring it in gradually to make a smooth gravy, then repeat with 100ml cold water. Slit the fresh chillies down their length, so they remain whole but open, add these to the pan, too, and bring to a boil. Turn down the heat a little, then leave to simmer for about 10 minutes, until the gravy has slightly thickened.Meanwhile, prepare the fish and seafood. As long as you have enough for four people, you can use just about anything you fancy in this dish, but I like to go for a mix of firm white fish, such as pollock, and prawns for their nutty sweetness. Cut the fish into roughly 2cm chunks, removing any skin, and shell the prawns, if need be (or use whole large ones, if you prefer – two per person, say).You can make the dish up to this point ahead of time if you like, but don’t add the fish and seafood until you’re ready to eat, otherwise it will be tough and overcooked if reheated. Taste the sauce, adjust the seasoning, if necessary, then drop in the fish and seafood, and cook gently for about five minutes, until translucent.Meanwhile, make the tadka, or tempered oil, to finish the dish. Heat the remaining oil in a small frying pan on a high heat, then add the mustard seeds and curry leaves.Cook for 30 seconds, until the seeds begin to pop, then stir into the curry pot. Top with a little chopped coriander and serve with steamed rice.This gravy is very versatile: substitute the fish and seafood for vegetables of your choice (pre-cooked first, if they won’t be done in five minutes) or chunks of firm tofu, or paneer, or even hard-boiled eggs. Aubergines and summer squash would be delicious choices, as would green beans, fennel or cauliflower. Cooked chicken would also be good."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a22e79db975a2eaa13bca0a25b0651fc42c7cde/186_719_5455_3273/master/5455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5d3e2b3e40f421f6e633dc5b877cb4d","title":"top chefs back tom kerridge for calling no show diners disgraceful","story":"Concerns raised about high landlord rents and fewer customers due to social distancingTop chefs have rallied behind Tom Kerridge after he criticised “selfish” and “disgraceful” customers for failing to show up and honour their reservations.They also raised concerns about the high costs of landlord rents, which they still have to pay despite operating at half capacity, and the risks associated with a lack of custom.Over the weekend, Kerridge criticised 27 people who did not turn up at the Corinthia Hotel in central London without letting the restaurant know. In an interview with the , Kerridge said: “There has been a huge response from the industry around no shows. It happens all the time but quite often people accept it or don’t talk about it.”He added: “It’s not just about me, it’s about the people’s jobs who we employ and small independent restaurants, so the industry has been supportive and pleased that I highlighted it.” Kerridge said that he will probably introduce a cancellation policy at the London venue.Michelin star chef Tom Aikens, who has a 25-diner restaurant in London’s Belgravia called Muse, said he was not opening until September but usually asked for deposits that would cover the price of the menu. He said: “I don’t know why people think it’s OK not to cancel, it is like going to friends’ dinner party and then deciding on the night not to go. It would be rude to not even phone to explain, so why would you do that to chefs and restaurateurs?”“I think the one big thing for many restaurants is paying rent – it’s a big number for a lot of people and they need continued help with that while we go through the next six to nine or 12 months. Having customers that feel safe and want to come to restaurants regularly is going to take some time, it really is. I am not sure of when we will see restaurants full again.”Two Michelin-starred restaurateur Raymond Blanc said he was preparing to open Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons and due to social distancing guidelines there were a limited number of tables. “As an ongoing policy, we take card details at the time of booking and explain to our guests that should their plans need to change, we ask that they kindly advise us in advance. We explain that changes to bookings can of course be made should they wish, however, if they fail to arrive without notice, a charge will be made to their card.”He added: “We are all working so very hard to ensure we keep our guests and our staff safe and it saddens me greatly to hear that as the hospitality re-opens its doors again so many people are just not turning up. We fully understand that people might be apprehensive, but if you are worried just be kind enough to let us know of your change of mind.”James Golding, head chef at The Pig in Dorset, said they had quite a few cancellations but were making it back through walk-ins. “I suppose if we did not have those walk-ins then we would be in a different situation. We also find that because we have a lot of open space … If you do come in and are not comfortable in the restaurant we can say go outside and order a lighter lunch option and go where you want to go.”Kerridge said that restarting the industry would be very difficult, especially for London-based restaurants. “There is not the travel and tourism there, the whole of London is relatively quiet… Marlow, where my other restaurant is, there is still a vibrancy about it and numbers booking there are relatively strong.”He added: “I have concerns about the whole economic situation we are facing – we are heading towards a global recession rapidly and I worry that when furlough ends many sectors will be affected by redundancies. Right now people are being paid by the government essentially and when that finishes, the month after that has finished, many businesses have to have earnt enough money to pay wage bills.”“I am of course worried about the hospitality industry as that is my industry but there is a bigger picture here, we are all heading to some form of economic slowdown. I am fearful it will be a rapid halt and then we have got the really lovely pressing engagement of Brexit to try and deal with.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d87f98bccf5d1e153555a5a5a2c60515c78a346/125_126_3619_2171/master/3619.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=14cfe8f445f45e5a4fb239956aad62ec","title":"artists kabul mural artlords afghan imagery corruption","story":"Muralists are covering the Afghan capital’s blast walls with agitprop imagery and calling out corruptionby  Stefanie Glinski in KabulFrom the killing of George Floyd in the US and the drowning of Afghan refugees in Iran, to the signing of the US-Taliban agreement towards peace and brutal murder of a Japanese aid worker, a group of Afghan artists have taken paintbrushes to adorn Kabul’s grey blast walls with vivid imagery.The barriers have been transformed into politically inspired murals, which the artists hope will create “visual dialogue” and raise awareness of corruption and injustices.The war-torn Afghan capital is full of these large concrete barriers, often separating diplomatic and governmental headquarters from the rest of the otherwise beautiful city of rolling hills and old brick houses.The worsening security situation and countless attacks have seen more blast walls built all over Kabul, blocking off roads and sheltering buildings and people from potential suicide bombs.Kabul’s green zone, a highly fortified area home to embassies and news agencies, is surrounded by tall, heavy walls.Since 2014, Artlords – a word play on warlords and drug lords, of which Afghanistan has many – a collective of artists and volunteers, has put some of the country’s politics into paintings, aiming to reflect the city’s atmosphere.“We want to turn public opinion into murals, that’s why we paint what we hear on the streets,” explained Abrar Kakarr, Artlords’ programme manager. “We don’t want to offend, we want to criticise.”The group recently sketched a portrait of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man killed by police in Minneapolis, as well as a mural of Afghan refugees drowning in a river in Iran after fleeing their home country It is alleged that Iranian border guards forced them into the water at gunpoint.“We painted those in a day,” Kakarr said. “We usually electronically project the image against the wall and then e into the painting process with brushes, ladders and a bunch of volunteers.”Another mural, of the head of a Japanese aid agency, Tetsu Nakamura, who specialised in irrigation projects and was killed by gunmen in the eastern city of Jalalabad in December, went up in Kabul shortly after his murder. “Let’s not plant anything but the seed of love and friendship in this pure land,” a line next to his painted profile reads.The group has 10 members of staff, including some artists, and around 35 volunteers.All this inspired Artlords co-founders Omaid Sharifi and Kabir Mokamel to paint their first mural: a pair of eyes and the words “I see you” – aimed at questioning the “corrupt government” and creating dialogue.Since then, the group has painted almost 2,000 murals in 19 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. Some work has been commissioned by UN agencies and embassies to raise awareness about the development agenda. But other independent pieces are aimed at stirring political debate.The group – now mainly funded by international donors – has faced praise and criticism. Some have questioned whether beautifying explosion-proof walls denies their purpose and the continuing war in the city, but Artlords has said it will continue to promote messages of peace and social justice, as well as use its work to target alleged government corruption.“Artlords has increased the authorised use of graffiti on the concrete walls segregating military and governmental actors from the public and with it has transformed the city’s walls into public canvases,” says Paniz Musawi Natanzi, a German-Iranian academic who holds a doctorate in gender and cultural politics with a focus on Afghanistan.Some murals may have caused controversy, but so far only one has been removed. Two years ago, the group painted a portrait of Hamida Barmaki, a law professor and human rights activist killed with her husband and four children in a 2011 suicide attack claimed by Hizb-i-Islami militants. The mural, painted on a blast wall near the home of the militants’ leader, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar – a former mujahiddin chief who has since entered the Afghan government – was quickly removed by Hekmatyar’s men.“They took buckets of paint to it,” Kakarr said. “We hoped to make a point: Look, he has joined the government, but he’s a killer.” His crimes were pardoned by the Afghan government as part of a peace deal.“We want to be a voice for the people through our art. We want to make sure that those who are in power hear this voice and feel ashamed. They should know that people have not forgotten the crimes that they have done during the past years,” said Sharifi in response to the vandalising of Barmaki’s memorial mural.Kakarr added: “Politically, we’re facing an uncertain future in Afghanistan. Many people fear the Taliban gaining strength many are directly affected by killings and attacks. We hope our murals can address the suffering and injustices faced and point towards peace.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/939bcf9911dc813b76f815d7fe13df10f92d9a6d/0_434_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68f40ad263f43a59dfaca01e21985fdd","title":"the power of touch im shielding with small children chubby thigh squeezes have saved my 2020","story":"This year has been tough for everyone. But in a world starved of physical contact, I’ve been a guilty glutton, entangled in a cornucopia of limbsWelcome to the ’s Power of Touch seriesWhen I lie down on the floor – which is frequently at the moment because I’ve spent exactly 116 days in lockdown with a three-year-old and her baby brother and I’m never not utterly exhausted – my daughter takes advantage. She clambers up my shins, hooks her tiny rib cage over my bent knees and pulls herself up until it feels as if her lungs may crumple … then es headfirst down my thighs, crash landing on my stomach with a shriek of pure glee. We call it the Slide Game, one of the many activities we do together best described as “fun at first, losing its appeal by the 57th go”.The Slide Game normally ends with a bear hug her trapped wriggling under my arms as I press our faces together, wondering how long I can get away with not letting her go, because I want to never let her go. At least she can wriggle free, unlike her brother, who has little say in accepting my shower of soggy kisses and chubby thigh squeezes. Not that he seems to mind, choosing to attach himself to me koala-like for large parts of the day, nails dug in my neck while my lips rest on his fuzzy hair.Lockdown has been cruel on everyone I know, in all kinds of ways. I’ve been shielding because it’s still unclear whether the blood clotting cancer I have interacts badly with Covid-19. That has meant embarking on a perma-childcare shift, one that normally begins at about 5am and stretches ahead like a road in the desert, with no places to refuel along the way. I barely leave the house, my brain has turned to mush and I often find myself sitting slumped with my phone, too tired to conjure up entertainment beyond finding the channel PAW Patrol is on.But lack of human touch is not a trauma I can share. In a world starved of physical contact, I’m a guilty glutton, squirrelled away with my plentiful supply, entangled in a cornucopia of limbs feet in my ribs fingers in my nostrils. My kids slip soapily down my body when I shower them, murmur gently when I hug them close, spray hay fever sneezes across my face like the super-spreaders of love that they are. I can’t get enough. To quote the great Labi Siffre, I could almost eat them. Sometimes, I try, swallowing my son’s shoulder blade or cheek whole – nyom-nyom-nyom – while he yanks at my hair and ears (actually incredibly painful, please stop, if you’re reading this).At the end of this year, when corona was still just something you put half a lime in, I asked the comedian Rob Delaney how he spends his time when he is at home. “Jigsaws,” he said, “and being sat on by as many of my children as possible at any one time.” Well, my wife and I bought a 1,000-piece jigsaw after that comment and, after spending six months piecing it together, we both can confirm the second activity is a lot more fun. Touch is like a circuit board lighting up your insides, a druggy jolt racing through your pleasure diodes.So while this year has undoubtedly been one of the toughest periods I can remember, I can’t pretend that this abundance of touch has ever been suffocating, or even annoying. Instead, I have learned that touch is the one thing you can never have too much of.• Tim Jonze is the associate editor of  Culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e2b29de49b5d96457fac1a32a31cf4bd83c1aa0/0_232_4446_2666/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=efe9ecb7e427f051bcf98969cbc530c8","title":"iconic festival sets nusrat fateh ali khan womad 1985","story":"Revellers on Essex’s Mersea Island were transfixed by the sheer spiritual power of Khan’s first performance outside south Asia, which marked a turning point in attitudes towards global musicNusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s voice is quite unlike any other. At turns heavy and hulkingly powerful, yet also nimble and pointedly precise, his vocalisations have come to epitomise not only the tradition of the Sufi qawwali but the art of singing itself.The qawwali is an Islamic devotional music designed to bring its performers and audience to a state of rapture and trance-like communion with the ine. Born of a 600-year-old line of qawwali singers, Khan’s grasp of music as a form of spiritual communication was acute. For the few thousand attendees at the Womad festival in 1985 witnessing Khan perform for the first time outside of south Asia, their experience would have been one of unexpected transcendence.Peter Gabriel had begun the festival only three years earlier as a western showcase of music from around the world, as well as that of his peers. The first edition, held in the Somerset town of Shepton Mallet, saw performances by Gabriel, Indian sitar player Imrat Khan and free jazz trumpeter Don Cherry. Poor access to the festival site and low attendance almost sunk Womad in its first year, but a well-timed reunion concert for Gabriel’s old band Genesis kept them afloat.On the weekend of 19 July 1985, revellers travelled to the tiny Mersea Island in Essex for headliners New Order, the Fall and Toots and the Maytals. For the large majority, Khan would have been an obscure name – perhaps one mistakenly associated with the vastly different practice of the sitar raga popularised two decades earlier by Ravi Shankar.At midnight, after all the other performances had finished for the day, attendees witnessed Khan taking to the cramped, carpeted stage with his Party: nine members of his extended family of qawwali players, including his brother Farrukh Fateh Ali Khan on the harmonium. It was balmy and mercifully dry when promoter Muhammad Ayyub introduced them as “the most famous qawwal in the Indian subcontinent” before Farrukh’s harmonium gently piped in, playing the opening alap for Allah Ho. This 20-minute qawwal unfurls like one long crescendo, luring the listener in to its softly accelerating, swung beat of tablas and hand claps before suddenly Khan’s voice arrives.Listening to a recently digitised recording of the show now, it is still shocking in its force. Farrukh opens by singing along with his harmonium melody, yet Nusrat soon overtakes with a throaty, air-gulping yawp, leaping sideways into a high-register harmony. He leads the charge, the entire Party soon clapping in unison as he swaps phrases with child singer Kaukab Ali before they build to Khan’s signature sargam: a rapid-fire wordless vocalisation over chromatic scales in which Khan dances through melody like a bebop sax player through the pounding of drums.The Party follow that electric opening and rounds of applause with what would become one of Khan’s biggest commercial successes, Haq Ali Ali, a mid-tempo ode to the revered Sufi figure of the prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law. Then comes tabla player Dildar Hussain working up a polyrhythmic sweat during the raucous choral celebration of Shabhaz Qalandaz. Closing with a love song, or ghazal, Biba Sada Dil Morr De, Khan finds new gymnastic phrasings through the repetition of the song’s title, yearning as his husky voice cracks before each breath: “Give my heart back,” he entreats in Urdu.It is hard to overstate how important this concert was, not only for the assembled crowd, but Khan, too. After he had spent 14 years as the head of his family’s qawwal troupe, building a reputation as a religious performer in India and Pakistan, his Womad set brought him the secular fame and commercial viability of the western music industry. Here his music would inspire a new-age spiritualism of an entirely different kind.Months after Womad, Khan travelled to Paris where he made a series of beautiful live recordings for the Ocora label, as well as in London for the Indian music label Navras. In 1989, once Gabriel had founded his own Real World Records, Khan went on to release some of his most experimental and engaging albums under the imprint, such as 1990’s Mustt Mustt. In 1997, he died suddenly at the age of just 48.Khan’s 1985 Womad performance finds him at the raw prime of his talent. As the first generation of the British Asian community was coming of age and finding its own identity, so Khan’s alighting in the nation would have been a cultural lodestone a bridge to the past of their parents, as well as an acknowledgment of their diasporic present. It not only marked a turning point in attitudes towards global music in the UK, but among qawwal practitioners themselves. Until Khan started playing internationally, this music was considered a purely religious expression. The first of his many performances in secular environments helped transform this powerful, devotional form into an emblem of south Asian culture recognised around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9330171722c4a7ac2aa49a8de34ed5bd428c6737/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d3739a56a845b1d7a5b57ab9ed41bf6","title":"nick drake john martyn complex friendship small hours extract","story":"A new book explores a musical friendship entailing joy, anger, ‘mountains of drugs’ … and tragedy. In this extract, the pair’s friends examine a complex rivalryIn 1967, Robin Frederick, a singer-songwriter originally from Florida, returned to London from studying in Aix-en-Provence, where she had met a young, beautiful, meandering and tantalisingly unattainable young Englishman called\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrake. Frederick “spent the summer in London with John Martyn, listening to\u0026nbspSgt Pepper\u0026nbspand the Incredible String Band, watching John learn to play sitar in about 10 minutes, living on toast and tea”.She wrote the beautiful Sandy Grey about\u0026nbspDrake, which cast him “in the role of wandering, rootless, fatherless boy”. Martyn recorded the song on his debut album,\u0026nbspLondon Conversation. At the time, he didn’t know it was about\u0026nbspDrake, or indeed even who\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwas. Perhaps he saw something of himself in it.Introduced by their mutual friend Paul Wheeler, Martyn and Drake met for the first time in 1968, a year before the release of\u0026nbspDrake’s debut album,\u0026nbspFive Leaves Left. “Nick laughed a lot at John’s perceptive and witty comments,” Wheeler says. “Those were qualities which John used to win over live audiences … I think John was impressed by\u0026nbspNick’s ‘cool’.”By 1969 and 1970, the social circle at the basement flat on Denning Road which Martyn shared with his wife Beverley and her young son, Wesley, was drawn largely from the Witchseason and Island labels. It offered a familial, nurturing camaraderie.\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspoften dropped in\u0026nbsphe,\u0026nbspMartyn,\u0026nbspand Richard Thompson would play in each other’s company, but almost always inidually rather than interacting with one another. “I never remember them jamming together,” says Linda Thompson. “They were all brilliant guitarists, very different and stylised, so you couldn’t just jump in. They were careful not to tread on each other’s toes. It’s a dick thing they all wanted to be better than each other.”During this period Martyn and\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspbecame very close. In 2005 Martyn told me, “Nicky was one of my favourite human beings in the world.” Throughout his life, Martyn’s friendships with other men could be intense: tactile, tempestuous, thoughtful and surprisingly gentle, with lots of kisses and hugs. “John was different from other people in Glasgow he was very free,” says Linda Thompson. “He wasn’t at all uncomfortable or frightened of loving a man – not in a physical way – which was quite unusual in those days.\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspand John loved one another. It was quite Greek, without the sex.”Drake\u0026nbspwas living in Haverstock Hill in Belsize Park. The Martyns were a single stop down the Northern line in Hampstead. Half a mile apart.\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwas accustomed to being looked after – it had been that way at home, at school and at university – and the pattern continued among his friends. “Whatever\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbsphad, we were all helpless in front of it,” says Linda Thompson. “He had this messiah thing, which he did not try to cultivate at all, which made it all the more powerful. He truly didn’t care if you were there or not.” He enjoyed company “as long as he could choose to come and go,” says Wheeler. “He was like one of those cats which turn up at many households, all of which are under the impression that they have a unique role in providing food, shelter and company.”At Denning Road, “he would come around and babysit sometimes,” Beverley, Martyn’s then wife,\u0026nbspsays. “He smelled the food cooking. I don’t think he had money to eat. He wore his father’s cast-off suits and his shirt was fraying at the edges.” When the Martyns went on holiday to Hastings, staying in the house they would eventually buy in the old town,\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwould sometimes come with them, sitting on the beach in his shabby suit, gazing out to sea. “He was the most introverted character I’ve ever met,” says Beverley, whose love for\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwas powerfully maternal. “I realised how sensitive he was, and John was very good with him, very gentle.\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspwas no threat, so John looked after him. He was the only person John allowed, apart from Art Garfunkel, to visit me when he was away. We’d make jokes, take the piss and try to make him laugh. We’d open the door and go, ‘Oh no, not\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrag again!’”On the surface,\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspand Martyn were poles apart. “Nick\u0026nbspwas a bit of a fragile lad,” says Pentangle’s Danny Thompson. “He was the kind of performer who would come on stage and stare at the floorboards during his whole set, then walk off without saying anything. John was completely the opposite.”Posthumously,\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbsphas been almost deified, artfully moulded into the platonic ideal of a tortured artist, a beautiful young man too sensitive for the cut and thrust of the music industry or, indeed, the modern world in general. Some of that is true, and some of it is a feat of retrospective branding which has little romanticism about it. The resurrection of\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspin the 1990s as the quintessential cult artist was driven by a hard-headed marketing decision by PolyGram. Having bought Island Records, the company were keen to recoup losses on artists who had never sold any records.Drake\u0026nbspwas gentle and withdrawn and enigmatic, certainly, but the reverence around him obscures part of the picture. Paul Wheeler maintains that he and Martyn were not quite so far apart as the mythos suggests. “I was in the middle of\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspand John, and I had a close relationship with both of them,” says Wheeler. “They are often cast as opposites – upper-class versus working-class and all that – but none of those things are actually true. It depends what bit you look at. In terms of sensitivity they were quite close, and\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspcould get very angry indeed.”If Danny Thompson became Martyn’s wildly extrovert alter ego, his sharp, bright, full-beamed reflection, then\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwas his dark shadow, something like a conscience: a hazy likeness of the more vulnerable, private and guarded part of his nature, the one revealed in song but rarely in person. “I think John’s spirit related to\u0026nbspNick’s spirit,” says Bridget St John. “He might have been outwardly different, but inwardly he and\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspwere very, very similar. They both could tap into the really deep beauty in things.”Drake\u0026nbspsold so few records in his lifetime he was scarcely a professional threat, but his blank immunity to approval and his unshowy refusal to compromise presented a form of unspoken challenge to Martyn, who affected not to care about such things but probably in the end cared too much.Sitting by the window in Denning Road, Martyn would see\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspdescending the steps down to the basement and immediately rearrange his demeanour. If he and a friend were exchanging ideas on the guitar, that would stop.\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwould usually go into the kitchen first to talk quietly with Beverley. Martyn would twitch and mutter impatiently until\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbsploped through to the living room. Early on, he made attempts to persuade his notoriously performance-averse friend to gig more frequently. When\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspreleased\u0026nbspFive Leaves Left\u0026nbspin the summer of 1969, Martyn played the record in the company of friends, skipping impatiently from track to track: “What do you think of that? What do you think of that?”There were less lofty connections. “They did mountains of drugs together,” says Linda Thompson. There is also the suspicion that, however superficial,\u0026nbspDrake’s artfully faded officer-class credentials appealed to Martyn, who was not averse to concocting a heavily mythologised personal biography, in much the same way that Bob Dylan had a few years previously.In Martyn’s case, his imagined CV betrayed a surprising degree of intellectual insecurity. A public schoolboy and son of a managing director, whose family home in Tamworth-in-Arden was sufficiently grand to come with a name attached – Far Leys –\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbsphad access to a social cachet that could neither be bought nor earned. Martyn very obviously appropriated parts of his backstory, as well as that of Paul Wheeler, telling several friends at the time that he had also attended Cambridge University, “which was certainly bollocks,” says Wheeler. “I think John wanted to be\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrake, and that’s what he did,” says Beverley Martyn. “He got Danny Thompson together and they went free-form.”The title track of\u0026nbspMartyn’s classic 1973 album Solid Air\u0026nbspwas written for\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrake, who in February 1972 had released what turned out to be his last album, the mordantly beautiful\u0026nbspPink Moon. “I remember John going to see Nick,” says Wheeler. “The day he got back, he rang me and sang Solid Air to me over the phone, unaccompanied.”By now,\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwas increasingly withdrawn and taking antidepressants. His friends shuttled between exasperation and despair. “I tried everything to wake\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspup,” says Danny Thompson. “Being nasty to him, being kind to him, inviting him to my home in Suffolk – and John did the same. Maybe Solid Air was meant as a kick up the bum, but it was very difficult. As John says in the song, there was a lot going on in\u0026nbspNick’s mind.”Martyn said the song was “done for a friend of mine, and it was done right, with very clear motives”. Triangulating between murmuring empathy, frustration and foreboding, he ines not only\u0026nbspDrake’s quietly devastating emptiness, but the maddening impossibility of reaching him. There are declarations of unconditional love and solidarity, and the solemn promise to “follow you anywhere”, wherever it might lead.On the morning of 25 November, 1974, news reached Cobourg Place, Martyn’s home in Hastings, that\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbsphad died at his family home in Tamworth-in-Arden from an overdose of antidepressants, a death deemed to be suicide by the coroner, though the verdict has been contested publicly by his family. He was 26.His death was not entirely a surprise, but it shook the Martyns hard. Beverley felt she shared at least some understanding of the pain\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbsphad been in. “I was taking antidepressants in 1972 or 73,” she says. “I knew that he was ill and he needed help, but who could you go to? Sometimes he would talk, sometimes he wouldn’t talk, sometimes he would have a cup of tea and hold it for three hours looking out at the sea.”In contrast to the romantic myth that\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspsimply dissolved passively into a kind of bleached nothingness, he harboured a large amount of active anger towards the end of his life. “I think\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbsphad gone beyond disillusion into rage,” says Paul Wheeler.\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbsphad stayed at 10 Cobourg Place not long before his death and seemed uncharacteristically confrontational. Returning from a visit to the pub, where he had observed his friend chatting up a barmaid, he called Martyn “devious” and refused to hug Beverley when he left. “It was as if John had said or done something that night that had really upset him,” she wrote.That visit was the last time Beverley saw\u0026nbspDrake, although Martyn reportedly made a trip to Tamworth-in-Arden not long afterwards where, Martyn claimed, Drake disclosed disclosed the extent to which he felt he had failed with his musical career. “I never realised\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbspwas ambitious until he confided to me that he was, and it took me greatly by surprise,” Martyn once told me. “It crushed him that he was ignored, because he was used to excelling at everything: as a student, as an athlete. In his eyes, it was the first time he’d ever failed at anything. It astonished me that he actually valued commercial success, but then I’m not ambitious at all, believe it or not.”Island producer Phill Brown, Martyn’s friend and neighbour during the second half of the 70s, recalls Martyn telling him that he’d had “this terrible argument with\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbspDrake.\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbsphad accused him of selling out because he had gone electric and was using pedals and things. John did his usual, wiped the floor with him verbally, which was a tough thing to do to\u0026nbspNick\u0026nbsp– and they were the best of mates. Within a month he was dead, and John had never phoned up to say sorry. That really haunted John. I remember being with him not long afterwards, and he was just destroyed.”It was Wheeler who called Martyn to tell him the news that\u0026nbspDrake\u0026nbsphad died. “I remember him just laughing, and I remember being totally disturbed at the time. The laugh scared me. John had a number of different characters which he would adopt in different circumstances. On first hearing about\u0026nbspNick’s death, I think he adopted the character of a tough guy who had no time for those who rejected help, probably as a defence mechanism to guard his own sensitivity and fear of isolation.”Speaking years later, Martyn said: “I laughed, for which my wife never forgave me. I don’t think I’ve ever cried for Nicky. It seemed so obvious that it would come.” According to Beverley, Martyn simply said, “He did it,” and walked out of the room, not to be seen again for two days. There is no record of him attending the funeral on 2 December, and by the middle of the month he was back on the road.• Extracted from Small Hours: The Long Night of John Martyn by Graeme Thomson, published by Omnibus Press on 9 July.

His name is synonymous with the history of Italian music in the second half of the 19th century, his work is central to the repertory of every opera house in the world. He is sometimes compared with Shakespeare, whom he adored, though he spoke little English and knew the Bard’s work only in translation.The son of an innkeeper, Verdi was born in Le Roncole, near Parma, and went to school in nearby Busseto, where his talent was noticed by Antonio Barezzi, a local merchant, who oversaw his early musical education. At 18 he was rejected by the Milan conservatory, but remained in the city (at Barezzi’s expense) to study privately. His first opera, Oberto, was well received at its La Scala premiere in 1839, and the theatre’s manager, Bartolomeo Merelli, wanted more. Un Giorno di Regno was a fiasco the following year, however. Verdi’s discouragement, combined with depression at the death of his first wife, almost made him abandon composition, though his third opera, Nabucco, undertaken at Merelli’s insistence, made him famous overnight.He called the period that followed his “galley years,” during which he composed an opera roughly every eight months, and the best of his early works have a clamorous vitality that continues to enthral. Ernani (1844) is a rip-roaring thriller. Macbeth (1847, revised in 1861) was the first of his Shakespearean operas. By 1847, he had become so well known internationally that there were premieres in London (I Masnadieri) and Paris (Jérusalem, a reworking of the earlier I Lombardi).Busseto and its environs remained his home for much of his life. With success came affluence, and in 1851 he moved with his partner, the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi, into a new villa where he lived until the end of his life. He and Giuseppina, although in a relationship since 1847, did not marry until 1859. Local opposition to their unmarried status colours Verdi’s depiction of Giorgio Germont’s disapproval of his son’s affair with Violetta in La Traviata.When Verdi was born, Italy was a ided nation, made up of small inidual states under Austrian or French occupation. Opinions differ as to how much he intended his early work as a demand for liberation and unification, but, beginning with Nabucco, with its Chorus of Hebrew Slaves mourning the loss of their country, his operas became the focus of the nationalist aspirations of the Risorgimento. In 1859, two years before the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, “Viva Verdi” became an acronym for “Viva Vittorio Emmanuele, Re D’Italia,” and in 1861, the composer briefly served in the newly formed Italian parliament.After the Requiem, Verdi ostensibly retired from public life, though this was by no means the end of his career. His publisher, Giulio Ricordi, engineered a collaboration with writer-composer Arrigo Boito, which resulted first in a major revision of Simon Boccanegra, unsuccessful at its first performance, then in Otello and Falstaff, premiered in 1887 and 1893 respectively. A score of remarkable power, Otello is for many the greatest of all operatic adaptations of Shakespearean tragedy. Falstaff, based on The Merry Wives of Windsor and Henry IV, is widely regarded as Verdi’s farewell to the stage, a bittersweet comedy that looks back on life with humour as well as sadness, before resolving its tensions in a fugue that asserts that “Everything in the world is a joke.”Verdi was a constant innovator and there is an immense stylistic difference between Falstaff and his early works. He effectively re-wrote the history of Italian opera by first perfecting and then dismantling the bel canto traditions he inherited from his predecessors Bellini and Donizetti – the formal patterns that subided arias and scenes into slow and fast sections, separated by recitative or linking passages.Traditional structures still underlie the great operas of the early 1850s. From Simon Boccanegra onwards, Verdi increasingly pushes at the limits of form in a quest for dramatic intensity and psychological veracity, though we are still aware of structural demarcations between arias, choruses and ensembles. But in Otello and Falstaff, traditional formal boundaries are dissolved. Recitatives, arias and ensembles flow seamlessly into one another, each act unfolds in a single unbroken musical . Comparisons were (and still are) made with Wagner’s methodology of through-composing each act, though Verdi profoundly distrusted Wagner’s symphonic method with its ceaseless thematic elaboration.Yet the reason why Verdi matters ultimately lies, perhaps, beyond musicological considerations and can be found, I suspect, in his profound assertion of our common humanity, captured and expressed in the visceral thrill of the singing voice in full flood. From Rigoletto onwards there are no stereotypical heroes and villains in his operas, only people, portrayed with all their strengths and fallibilities, and their potential for both greatness and evil. Again it is a standpoint that places him in opposition to Wagner, his exact contemporary (they were born the same year), the great myth maker, who creates, destroys and redeems worlds, where Verdi celebrates existence by compassionately accepting and exploring life in all its variety.Singers and conductors have long been drawn to Verdi. All of his operas have been recorded, many of them multiple times, sometimes deploying different editions that Verdi prepared in his lifetime, or making standard theatrical cuts. As far as conductors are concerned, Toscanini, Claudio Abbado and Herbert von Karajan are by turns thrilling and passionate, though you need Victor de Sabata or Carlo Maria Giulini for the Requiem, and Don Carlos is probably best served by Antonio Pappano in French and Georg Solti in Italian. For many, Leontyne Price is the greatest of all Verdi sopranos, and is unmissable in all her recordings of his music. Major interpreters of his work, are almost too many to list, but among them should perhaps be mentioned Maria Callas, Renata Tebaldi, Grace Bumbry, Carlo Bergonzi, Franco Corelli, Ettore Bastianini, Tito Gobbi and Nicolai Ghiaurov."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e64853270418239725248e64d757ab564f4497d8/0_50_1805_1083/master/1805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=764e6f817deaebb90bc3d07aa622b7af","title":"is uk golden era relations china over podcast","story":"China and the UK have clashed in recent months over a draconian new security law in Hong Kong and the Chinese tech company Huawei. ’s Tania Branigan examines whether a much-promoted ‘golden era’ between the two countries is at an end In 2015 George Osborne, the then chancellor, promised a ‘golden decade’ for Chinese-British relations as he drummed up support for new trade opportunities and inward investment.

The pandemic has simply accelerated that transformation, he said ahead of a British Retail Consortium webinar on the impact of Covid-19.Even an industry that has weathered its fair share of storms has never seen an event of this size and significance, and it’s becoming clear that the rules of engagement are changing. As retailers navigate uncharted waters, these are the rules that matter right now:Put safety firstAbove all, responsible businesses have to prioritise safety, both for staff and customers. According to Kyle Monk, head of retail insights and analytics at the British Retail Consortium, retailers are working hard on both implementing safety measures and communicating them clearly. Luckily, technology is on our side when it comes to designing systems that put safety first, but not at the expense of the customer experience. He cites a technology company that has shop assistants available by video screen in-store. The remote shop assistants can engage with you in a similar way in which they would normally.While it may seem at first that the new retail environment will not make the most fun of shopping experiences, with creativity, innovation and by utilising tech, companies can get the balance right.Be collaborative“The scale of the pandemic and the speed with which we’ve had to adopt a new way of living has left many of us feeling uncertain – especially retailers,” says Andrew Lawson, senior vice-president EMEA for Zendesk, a customer relationship management software company. The good news, however, is that a sense of optimism is emerging as businesses deal successfully with unstable operating conditions. “We’ve seen incredible stories of resilience coming out of the pandemic, as retailers and their suppliers band together to maintain the flow of goods,” says Lawson.This collaborative spirit will be important for the industry if it is to retain momentum, share best practice and agree about what support may be needed from the government. “It’s kind of unprecedented,” says Monk. “I don’t think, to be honest, any other industry is coordinating in the way that retail is at the moment.”PrioritiseWhile some retailers have launched e-commerce platforms in record time – one European chain that had around 1,000 stores but no e-commerce platform, managed to launch one in 13 weeks – Lawson suggests that incremental digital transformation might be the better way forward. Zendesk is finding that many of its customers are reluctant to invest time and money in total digital transformation when there is still so much uncertainty. “The priority is to identify solutions that can deliver returns on investment quickly,” he says. “For example, by looking at an omnichannel approach, you can bring all the information you have on a customer together in one place. This will provide your marketing and sales teams with invaluable insights.”Support your staffWe may never return to business as usual but, according to Lawson, companies can move forward by supporting and listening to feedback from staff. He also emphasises the connection between a happy and valued workforce, and the ability to be agile, scalable and resilient. “By helping employees adapt to new systems and processes through training and regular communication, and by really listening to feedback, the new styles and systems that we work under really can work for everyone,” he says.Appeal to your fansThere has never been a better time for companies to revisit their core purpose – building a trusted and valued brand. Research from Zendesk shows that customers have been more patient during the pandemic. While the volume of service requests and wait times have gone up, customer satisfaction remains fairly steady, indicating brand loyalty. Customers will support the brands that they want to succeed, says Monk.And Gibb believes successful retailers won’t have customers going forward, they’ll have loyal fans – people who care deeply about what that brand really stands for. For decision-makers in the retail business, who feel that the ground is constantly shifting beneath them, focusing on purpose could provide a much needed stable foundation.Things are changing fast.

The venue, which announced in May that it was postponing its entire summer season to 2021, is the first major London venue to announce the return of live theatre. Last week, it welcomed the government’s announcement that outdoor productions could resume and said it was looking for an economic way to open for a shorter period than usual this summer.Sheader said: “It has been, and continues to be, an incredibly challenging time for everyone working in the theatre industry. While the arts sector awaits details of how the government’s support package will be disseminated, I’m heartened that we have been able to start work again with a number of our colleagues and to employ over 140 people, including 70 performers and freelancers, at least for a brief period this summer.”He added that a clear timeframe for the reopening of the rest of the industry, together with the safe removal of social distancing measures in all venues, “remains critical to secure the future of the arts in the UK”.Regent’s Park Open Air theatre is also set to host comedy performances during the summer from standups including Rob Beckett, Russell Brand, Jimmy Carr, Kerry Godliman, Suzi Ruffell and Sindhu Vee.After last week’s government announcement, the Minack in Cornwall became one of the first venues to announce a new programme of work for the summer. A number of drive-in theatre performances are also taking place, including for the hit musical Six and the children’s show Horrible Histories. London’s Donmar Warehouse is also to reopen in August with a sound installation of Blindness, based on José Saramago’s novel, featuring the recorded voice of Juliet Stevenson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e34c8fe796da04ca7c131dc34f5ee06949fd4101/0_201_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26751bb573d4af538be35e34548f0a26","title":"theatres that made us susan wokoma gregory doran","story":"Susan Wokoma recalls plays backed by birdsong, Tallulah Brown found a fairytale in the reeds and Gregory Doran takes a trip back to LancasterTallulah Brown: The Pumphouse in Aldeburgh is a fairytale venue, a coat of many colours. Once upon a time before Covid, if you headed towards the marshes you’d stumble across it, disused for pumping but still very much host to theatre, music and comedy. In my 20s I programmed it for the Aldeburgh music festival and came to know the building intimately, as you do when you’re responsible for ticket stubs, loo roll, standing ovations and walkouts. The brick building is small enough to hear a whisper a hush descends and musicians often abandon their microphones. HighTide transformed the space when they produced Al Smith’s explosive play Harrogate on a purpose-built, glowing, white thrust stage. Punchdrunk used the surrounding field during Britten’s centenary: every 10 minutes an audience member wearing headphones would walk in the footsteps of Peter Grimes and step on to the marshes where they were met by crowds pointing accusingly from the reeds. The Pumphouse is where my band did our first gig, it’s where HighTide programmed my play Songlines. It’s a fairytale because it’s always an adventure, a surprise: Eleanor Bron reading Tennyson’s Enoch Arden followed by a vegetable orchestra playing a drilled parsnip. And like a fairytale, we hope for a happy ending, where we’re sat once again in a room of about 70 strangers, waiting for the lights to go down.Gregory Doran: Schoolboy memories from the 1970s of cramming into Mr Malone’s scout van and heading 20 miles up the M6 from Preston to the Duke’s Playhouse in Lancaster (now known as the Dukes). Harriet Walter – long before she was the super assassin Dasha in Killing Eve – clog dancing in a musical by Victoria Wood’s dad, Stanley, and delivering a harrowing performance as Goody Proctor in The Crucible. My classmates squealing when David Calder, as Eddie Carbone, kissed Rodolfo in A View from the Bridge then watching him a few weeks later as Macbeth. Ben Cross (years before Chariots of Fire) in Sweeney Todd, and apparently the whole of smoky Victorian London on stage. Gwendolyn and Cicely furiously splashing about in an onstage pool in The Importance of Being Earnest. Seeing some great plays, with the same great actors in show after show, and then if we were lucky, catching sight of them in the bar afterwards, before being packed back in the van home. It was an experience which changed my life.Susan Wokoma: I had never seen a show at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre before 2018. Embarrassing, as for years I went to a community Saturday drama class at St Marylebone School (a stone’s throw away) before attending the sixth form. When I finally made my first visit, I fell in love. It is the most beautiful theatre in London. Then a year later in 2019, I played Bottom in their first Midsummer Night’s Dream in over 20 years. Being on that stage as the sun set and the birds rustled in the trees above, was unspeakably nourishing. I’ve never worked in a friendlier building and being in the bar after the show felt like you were on holiday. I can’t wait to fight a pigeon for a seat again.Rachel O’Riordan: Belfast’s Old Museum Arts Centre was the place that gave me a start. It is now relocated and remodelled as the more glamorous Mac. But in the early 2000s the Omac, as everyone called it, was the creative heart and soul of a post-Good Friday agreement Belfast. There were several funded independent theatre companies in the city including Ransom, which I formed to produce Hurricane, written and performed by Richard Dormer. It was the first show I ever directed – despite that, the Omac programmed it. That was a bold move typical of a venue, run by Gillian Mitchell and Anne McReynolds, that captured the “let’s have a go” attitude of Belfast then. So many local companies had their work supported there, making it feel owned by everyone. There were volunteer ushers, tiny budgets and the brilliant Michael Draine as sole in-house technician who did everything. It was a tiny black box at the top of a flight of stairs, 100 seats, but in that theatre magic happened.Samantha Lane: I have dedicated my working life to making theatre with and for young people, so I guess it is unsurprising that my school hall, in particular a theatre-in-education production of Too Much Punch for Judy, has shaped my entire career. I was 13 and I’d only been to the theatre once before – to see a pantomime – so my only experience of live theatre had been flamboyant and full of spectacle. In complete contrast, this was sparse – four empty chairs and a handful of performers – and we weren’t even facing the stage! However, I was completely transported by this simple verbatim production, and by the end of the 45-minute experience I was sobbing. I couldn’t believe that these actors, with minimal set and an amazing ability to ignore the canteen staff setting up for lunch around them, were able to move me so much.Nigel Ng: Every comedian wants to play the London Comedy Store, and I was no exception. To get booked there you had to first go through King Gong, a brutal open-mic night where the audience is encouraged to boo you off - the ultimate “let the free market dictate what happens” scenario. It’s also one of the few times I’ve seen usually polite British society tell people how they really feel. Over the years I’ve risen through the ranks and now perform on their weekend lineups with some of the best comedians I’ve seen, some of them so good I fear following them because they would’ve decimated the crowd already. Comedy clubs sharpen a comic, they’re like the gym for us, making us stronger, faster, funnier. Without them every comedy show would feel like a monologue. And who wants that?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8da71934ba97d9001e3b14d2a9dbaed863a3c689/530_0_2499_1501/master/2499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d0fe191aa5aa2d3f5ea116f5c7801dc","title":"uk ban on huawei in 5g network groundless says chinese ambassador","story":"Beijing warns that removal of telecoms firm from UK network by 2027 will undermine trustThe British government’s decision to ban the use of Huawei in its 5G network is groundless and indicative of the UK’s junior status in its alliance with the US, Beijing has said as it vowed to take measures to protect the interests of Chinese companies.“Listening to all the rhetoric it was clear the UK had succumbed to pressure from China hawks and bashers,” said Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador to the UK. “We are not asking you to take sides between China and the US. We are just asking you to take the right side of the argument. Britain can only be Great Britain when it has an independent foreign policy.”Huawei had been dumped and purged, he added.On Tuesday the British government pledged to remove the Chinese telecoms firm from its 5G network by 2027, despite warnings of retaliation from Beijing.Fast-growing\u0026nbspHuawei\u0026nbspis arguably China’s first global multinational. The Shenzhen-based company makes mobile phones, base stations and the intelligent routers that facilitate communications around the world.But its success increasingly concerns the US, which argues Huawei is ultimately beholden to the Chinese Communist party and has the capability to engage in covert surveillance where its equipment is used.But Australia banned Huawei from 5G\u0026nbspin 2018, with its spy agencies declaring they were worried the company could shut down power networks and other parts of its infrastructure in a diplomatic crisis.Trump banned US companies from working with Huawei last year and has strenuously lobbied others to follow suit,\u0026nbspventing “apoplectic fury”\u0026nbspin a phone call to Boris Johnson after the UK agreed to allow the Chinese company into 5G.The company had successfully targeted the UK early on. It has supplied BT since 2003 and gradually expanded to the point where it agreed to create a special unit in Banbury,\u0026nbspknown as the Cell, where the spy agency GCHQ could review and monitor its software code. Vodafone is another key customer.In July 2020 the UK position changed, and it was announced that Huawei is to be stripped out of Britain’s 5G phone networks by 2027.\u0026nbspOliver Dowden, the UK culture secretary, also announced that no new Huawei 5G kit can be bought after 31 December 2020 – but said that older 2G, 3G and 4G kit can remain until it is no longer needed.Dan Sabbagh\u0026nbspDefence and security editorHuawei has become a pivotal issue in the geopolitical war between China and the US, which claims the firm poses a significant cybersecurity threat.Donald Trump claimed credit for the UK move, boasting in a press conference on Tuesday that no White House “has been tougher on China” than his administration.He said he had worked to pressure countries not to use Huawei. “If they want to do business with us, they can’t use it. We convinced many countries – many countries – and I did this myself, for the most part, not to use Huawei because we think it’s an unsafe security risk. It’s a big security risk.”Liu referenced Trump’s comments, saying: “President Trump is taking credit for the decision, saying it was his personal success … Everyone understands what is the reason behind the UK decision.”Ties between the UK and China have deteriorated over the past month after the UK criticised Beijing’s imposition of a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong, a former British colony, and pledged to support fleeing pro-democracy activists and protesters.Liu said the Huawei decision symbolised a new UK attitude to China, and twould do “deep damage to trust between China and the UK at both business and government level”.He added: “The Chinese government did not need to tell Chinese business how to respond to the UK decision since they would draw their own conclusions. It will undermine trust. Mutual trust and mutual respect is the basis for a relationship not just between countries but between iniduals. I would say it is not just disappointing but disheartening.”Over the past decade, successive UK governments have encouraged the growth of economic ties between Britain and China, which have become more crucial as London finalises its departure from the European Union.Liu refused to say if the so-called golden era between Britain and the UK had come to an end, pointing out that it had been a phrase proposed by the British, and endorsed willingly by China. He said he hoped Chinese students would still be welcomed in the UK, and said China was not seeking an economic decoupling.The bulk of his comments formed an appeal to the EU to remain China’s partners, saying there was a huge mutual economic interest, but stressed this had to be based on a mutual acceptance that neither side would interfere in the other’s internal affairs.“Those who see China as a systematic rival or potentially hostile have got it all wrong, chosen the wrong target and are heading in the wrong direction,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e9cae18939e04107e28cb22dd7512ec89903c4a/0_116_1732_1039/master/1732.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d82b6a84b015feebd3553e4b5b6d1e2","title":"from family holidays to suburban commutes why a hybrid suv makes sense","story":"SUVs don’t have to be the imposing gas-guzzlers we often think of them as. For extra storage space, comfort and reduced emissions, a hybrid SUV is worth considering for a variety of lifestylesAdam Smith identified Britain as a nation of shopkeepers, but these days it might be more accurate to say we’re a nation of small businesses. There are almost 6m in the country, of which 3.5m operate as sole traders.Many of those people, whether they work at home or from a small office, need transportation that is reliable, spacious, cheap to run and that can double as a family car. Whether you’re a caterer transporting cakes, a fitness trainer carrying weights or a maker selling craftwares at small markets, you need a vehicle that can adapt effortlessly to your needs and budget.A hybrid’s combination of petrol and electric power means those short delivery runs are more cost-effective and you never have to wait on a recharge. Emissions are reduced, meaning a small reduction in car tax but also reductions when certain types of low-emission vehicles are registered as a company car for tax purposes – useful when you’re watching every penny.There are plenty of other reasons to buy a large hybrid if you run a small business, of course, not least a huge amount of storage to stow goods away in. The latest Honda CR-V hybrid, for example, features a wider, deeper boot than in previous models, and can be opened by waggling your foot underneath, ideal if you’re loaded down with goods. A smart, flexible “company” car that’s tax deductible and cheaper to run? Sounds like good business.Face it, when you become a parent, you sign up to run a taxi service for the best part of 20 years. Factor in a twice-daily school run, regular shopping trips, weekend jaunts and holidays with two or three kids, perhaps a dog, too, and the attraction of a big car such as an SUV is undeniable. But there’s a major downside: emissions.Many schools in urban areas suffer from high pollution, exacerbated by parents depositing their kids at the school gates and waiting around when they pick them up later with engines needlessly idling. Fearing the effects, headteachers are calling for car bans and schools are leafleting parents to stop parking nearby. The city of Bristol is even discussing a potential diesel car-free zone, because of the dangerous particulates they emit. The UK Energy Research Centre recently revealed the surge in SUV sales was jeopardising the UK transport sector’s ability to meet EU emissions targets. That’s not a good look for a parent, even if an SUV is.The ideal solution is a more efficient, cleaner version that can still meet the needs of a busy parent – a hybrid that can run on pure electric around sensitive zones such as schools and in town.When you combine the other benefits a modern, large hybrid car brings to the party – such as high safety ratings, masses of room, plenty of storage and parking assist features – they begin to make a compelling case again.There are many downsides to a long commute, not least the grinding tedium of heavy traffic, the slow crawl and tailbacks with repeated stop-starts. Add to that stress and musculoskeletal disorders from sitting in an uncomfortable position, and public transport starts to seem a whole lot more appealing. However, if commute time, connectivity or the price tag make public transport difficult to justify, a low-emission vehicle might just be the next best thing, especially with today’s petrol and diesel prices.A hybrid with a stop-start system automatically shuts down and restarts the engine to reduce the amount of time it spends idling, reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. And you may just end up spending less on maintenance as well. Because of the regenerative braking system, you won’t use your standard brakes as much, resulting in less wear and tear. The batteries in hybrids are also designed to last the lifetime of the car, and have solid warranties to reflect this. The Honda i-MMD battery, which is used to power its new CR-V hybrid, is covered for five years or to a distance of 100,000km, whichever comes first.We all have many factors to consider when choosing which transport option best suits our lifestyle, but for some of us, a hybrid could tick quite a few boxes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03c4023329ab1ae422a6d9d205e04a9e0f233217/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d222a8630be5f43ea602c4db6b57f5b2","title":"mike leighs office almost went up in flames casting directors tell all","story":"As Bafta rewards scripted casting for the first time, those doing the choosing talk us through the process – from being flashed at in auditions to chasing would-be stars around with a tennerCasting can make or break a TV show or film. Pick the right actors and you could be looking at rave reviews and best performance accolades, while the wrong choice could be distracting or – worse still – drag down the whole production.This week’s Bafta television craft awards will be celebrating the importance of casting directors, with the first ever prize for casting on scripted TV series. Ahead of the awards, the nominees delved into the highs and lows of their profession, from pursuing potential new faces through the streets for days to discovering a huge new talent such as John Boyega.I loved the experience. I became obsessed and started chipping away at the main cast. I was offered David Mackenzie’s Young Adam straight after, with Tilda Swinton and Ewan McGregor.The only time I’m not looking for actors is when I’m driving. You look at someone to see if they’ve got something about them, their face and the way they move.The director I learned the most from emotionally was Claire Denis. She has a sensitivity towards the human condition. She’s very sharp. I learned the most about being a man from Yann Demange. He’s got a kindness there, a generosity. He was very patient with me.A guy came in on the first series of Top Boy. We were doing improv. He put a hand down his pants and pulled a gun out. Straight away, I could see it was metal. I thought: “It’s a real gun.” He was waving it around. It turned out it was a replica. A very good one. That was pretty bizarre. He kept stressing to me that he knew this world. I told him: “Calm down, we’re doing an audition. Let’s try it out where he’s just quietly intimidating.” He was excited to be there. He got there three hours early. I think that gun was down his pants for four hours.Our job is to take the vision of the writer, producer, director, and bring it to life by casting actors who we feel will do justice to the writing, the characters and the worlds they’re trying to create. That involves either seeking out new talent or making a wish list of actors that we think would be appropriate.Some directors will have particular ideas for roles and we start to build upon that or they’re very open to being informed of new actors or different names.You start by seeing who’s with an agent, who is out there as an actor working. We’ll look at National Youth Theatres, youth groups or sports clubs. A lot of times, we go to schools, colleges or universities. Sometimes if the brief is very specific, we’ll put it out on social media in the hope that people will share it.On World War Z, we were looking for a Korean sea captain. We couldn’t find what we were looking for on Spotlight at the time. I remember Googling online, running down to a few Korean restaurants, and finding someone there who was a chef. We brought him into the office, put him on tape and he got it.It’s funny how some actors try to think outside the box and do something that’s quite memorable. We were looking for a role on Bridget Jones’s Baby where these rioters would come in and at the end they would flash their bras to the camera. I remember saying to them: “Please come in but we’re not going to do that scene.” But one of them actually hoisted her top up and she’d written: “Pick me.”A few of the Sex Education guys came in for a lot of different roles. Once you saw them and realised they had this incredible potential, you wanted to hold on to them if they weren’t right for that certain part.The day that we cast Jamie Demetriou in Paddington 2, I was thrilled. I used to watch these five-minute videos on YouTube that he’d written and performed himself. I thought it was absolute genius. Everyone loves him now, he’s in everything.Some of the qualities needed as a casting director are a good memory, patience, the ability to keep an open mind, and having a real interest in people and what they are about. And liking actors. They are pretty impressive, after all.We cast John Boyega in Attack the Block when he was still a teenager. To see him become the star in Star Wars was pretty fantastic. His talent is undeniable. I really believed he was going to be the guy and together we persevered until everyone else saw it too.Sometimes in auditions, people do odd things. Occasionally, you can see that they have some sort of desperate urge to start removing clothing and you’re sitting there getting very nervous thinking: “Oh, for Christ’s sake, don’t do that. Put that back on!”One nameless person almost set Mike Leigh’s office on fire. There was some kind of weird improvisation going on involving a box of matches and a newspaper. It got completely out of control. Luckily, it was all OK in the end.One thing that we’re really proud of in Chernobyl is how the cast works as a whole. You have to remember to have an overall big picture vision of how it’s going to be rather than just thinking about it one person at a time. Each actor’s commitment, from the leads to the smallest part, makes it brilliant.Part of the job on The Crown involves helping actors find ways to play famous real-life characters without doing impersonations of them. Some people make an immediate connection and just run with it. I’ll never forget Claire Foy’s audition when she was heavily pregnant, with a plastic crown on her head she managed instantly to make the most famously inaccessible woman utterly accessible. I’m still not quite sure how she did it.Game of Thrones was an incredible adventure and they gave us great freedom to cast unknown actors. We had no idea it was going to become the thing it was. It was a buzz to watch all the performances developing as the years went by, especially all the younger ones whose first job it was.I appear fleetingly as a steward in season one which quickly confirmed to me that I’m better behind a camera than in front of one.Drama has been my life. It’s this magical moment when the role fits the actor, the two come together and it just works perfectly. It’s really beautiful. That’s what I love about casting. I can only be true to myself and my instincts.When I did The Last Samurai, Ken Watanabe was the first actor I introduced to the director Edward Zwick. I just thought he would be a great lead in the movie. But Edward, having just gotten off a long flight and possibly a little jet lagged, passed on Ken. After several weeks, he had seen many people but wasn’t happy with anyone and was getting frustrated that we didn’t have a lead. So I said: “Can we look at the guy that you met at the beginning? Because I just think he is really wonderful.” He said: “OK, sure.” When he came into the room, I think Edward knew that was him. You have to have persistence, faith and trust in your choices.I love when I get to cast a film that requires finding new talent. I still have a massive soft spot for Control because it was one of the first films I cast on my own. It had a discovery in the lead Sam Riley. I absolutely loved working on Lady Macbeth. I cast Florence Pugh previously in The Falling, which was her very first film, through an open casting call. I remember her chemistry test with Cosmo Jarvis very clearly. The thing that struck me about Florence was that she was completely fearless and just went for it. That’s what won her the role.In auditions, we are asking actors to be brave and expose themselves. To put themselves out there. We make that space as safe as it can possibly be. But ultimately, only one person can get the job. Rejection is the hardest thing. We have to go through that with so many actors, and that’s really hard especially when you know someone has fought for the role. It’s a part of the industry that is never going to change, but rejecting actors never gets any easier.You’ve got to really believe in actors and want to champion them. You’ve got to keep moving with something that’s always changing. You can never get really comfortable. It keeps you on your toes all the time.The Bafta television craft awards take place on 17 July, and are available to stream on YouTube and Facebook "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf8c4e529ba4400d5494cc8a3f475f93225cdf5f/0_248_4471_2683/master/4471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=012e5a553e8716e8b03357ac09f4da02","title":"cant afford turn away business view shops face mask rules england scotland","story":" speaks to shop owners about new face mask rules in Scotland and England After mixed messages last week from the UK government over the wearing of face coverings, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced on Tuesday they would be made mandatory in shops in England from 24 July.The policy, which was introduced in Scotland on Friday, will be enforced by police, who have the power to implement fines of up to £100, but shop workers will be expected to “encourage” the wearing of face coverings. spoke to shop owners about their thoughts on the announcement.“The word ‘mandatory’ is meaningless,” says 70-year-old Redmond Hanlon, who has owned his village convenience store in Devon for 35 years. “I’m not going to refuse entry to mask-free customers. I’ve got 80-year-old guys coming in first thing in the morning for newspapers. I’m not going to say, no, you can’t have your paper. These are guys I’ve known for years.”Hanlon says most customers do not wear face coverings, but he has been handing out free masks to customers who want them. Last week, he installed a pedal-controlled hand-sanitiser dispenser at the shop entrance and a screen over the counter.Rosie Fletcher is delighted face coverings will be mandatory from 24 July. She was already planning to ask customers to wear them in her north London shop, but the government’s announcement “means I have some more force behind it”, she says. “It’s not just me being wacky. I can say: ‘A-ha! The government says so too!’”While Fletcher, 30, is concerned some people might become “really belligerent” if she asks them to wear a face covering, “I’m working on standing my ground and telling them calmly that if they don’t wear a mask, they can’t come in”.Living with a number of autoimmune conditions, Fletcher is classed as extremely vulnerable and says it has been “absurdly difficult” trying to do business while protecting her health and the health of her staff. Her shop has been open two mornings a week for online order collections while they wait to see if the reopening of pubs and restaurants has an effect on case numbers.Making face coverings compulsory, she says, will make her feel more secure. “Masks aren’t magic but when people wear them, it says to me that they’re taking the pandemic seriously.”Matthew, who runs a furniture shop in Cornwall, says he cannot afford to turn away customers after being closed for 12 weeks during lockdown.“If I push people away from my front door, they’re just going to walk into my competitors,” he says. “I can’t afford to put my customers’ backs up. Boris Johnson is telling people to go back to the high street and shop, but I think this will put people off and turn them back to internet shopping, which we’re fighting against.”While Matthew and his employees have benefited from a government grant and the furlough scheme, he says the future of the business is still uncertain, and he fears things “could get tougher”.He also criticises the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for setting a bad example by not wearing a face covering during recent trips, such as when helping out at a Wagamama restaurant.“If you want retailers and customers to follow government policy, it would be helpful for government ministers to do it, right before they announce it as mandatory,” Matthew says. “Lead by example, and people will follow.”Encouraging shoppers to wear face coverings will be a balancing act, says Karan Sodhi, who runs a bridal store in Derby.Sodhi, 24, also wonders how the rules will be publicised. Many people in his community do not speak English as a first language, so he and his staff have been teaching customers about social distancing and hand hygiene. “Looking at the street now, nobody is wearing a face covering and I don’t see how that will change in a matter of days.”Regardless, Sodhi’s store will introduce mandatory face coverings from Monday, before 24 July. “We don’t see the need to wait,” he says. Especially as there’s growing evidence wearing a face mask protects people.”Crispin Willis, who runs a whole foods shop in the East Neuk of Fife, says that making face coverings mandatory in Scotland has massively increased customer confidence, and that fears about them deterring customers were, in his experience, unfounded.“Before they were made mandatory, there were lots of elderly people wearing masks and feeling uneasy that others weren’t. We invested in screens over the counter, and everyone calmed down a lot. They paid for themselves tenfold in the business we’ve made because people feel more confident,” he says. “When we started wearing masks, it calmed down further.”While Willis supports the measures, he thinks the policy of police enforcement is unrealistic.“I’m going to remind people and put up posters, but the nearest police station is a 20-minute drive in an emergency,” he says. “It’s hardly an emergency if people aren’t wearing face masks, so I wouldn’t make that call. It’s a waste of police time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76c44107636ac3c65032c0a98bba566ddb8a7836/0_47_2260_1357/master/2260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b908930d73da405f738636ea673d139","title":"egyptian doctors detained for highlighting covid 19 working conditions","story":"Overwhelmed staff detained by state security agency after voicing concerns about lack of PPE Overwhelmed and ill-equipped medical staff in Egypt are being threatened for speaking out about poor working conditions during the Covid-19 pandemic, with increasing numbers detained by a domestic security agency.Doctors recounted threats delivered via WhatsApp, official letters or in person. They said hospital managers and government officials told them failing to attend shifts, posting on social media or voicing objections would result in complaints to the National Security Agency, Egypt’s primary internal security body, which rights groups say has arrested multiple healthcare workers.A doctor in the outlying Cairo district of 6th October said hospital management regularly threatened staff with referral to the NSA, after they voiced concerns about a doctor who died but was not permitted to be PCR tested. “They told us our social media will be monitored to the extent I deleted all my colleagues since I can’t trust any of them,” she said.Another doctor at a hospital in Alexandria said when a group of medics gathered to demand a coronavirus test for a colleague showing symptoms people from hospital security and plainclothes police showed up.Egypt has recorded more than 80,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, although one government minister has repeatedly warned true case numbers could be five or even 10 times higher than official figures. The Egyptian Center for Public Opinion Research, known as Baseera, has estimated that at least 616,000 Egyptians were infected with Covid-19 . At least 117 doctors have died from coronavirus.Doctors have described a medical system overwhelmed by the virus with few hospital beds or medications available to treat even the most desperate patients and as the pandemic has tested Egypt’s health infrastructure, the medical workers branded the “White Army” by authorities have faced reprisals for speaking out.The Egyptian Medical Syndicate, a quasi-government body that represents healthcare workers, has also become a target after it accused the prime minister, Mostafa Madbouly, of inciting anger against doctors when he warned the government will “take appropriate legal measures” against absentee doctors, blaming their “lack of discipline” for the rise in cases.The rights group Amnesty International has documented the arrest of at least six doctors and two pharmacists, detained by the NSA for speaking out about the pandemic. In one case, the director of a hospital reported a pregnant doctor to the agency after she called a government hotline to register a Covid-19 case. She was detained on charges that included joining a terrorist group.“We are valueless for them. They sacrifice us,” said a medical worker at a public hospital in Giza. “We have no PCR tests. We have no drugs. We have no places to admit patients, we ask them to quarantine at home and to try to find drugs, even though we’re sure these drugs are lacking even in private pharmacies.”He described how doctors were told that absences mean they will be reported to the NSA, a body notorious for forcibly disappearing and torturing citizens in an effort to stamp out dissent from even the mildest critics. “I don’t dare to be absent, even from these shifts where I can’t help anyone,” he said. “I’m okay to put myself at risk if I can help people, but I’m doing so without any service to these patients.”The doctor said he bought himself a face shield, due to a profound shortage of protective equipment across Egypt. He feared requesting one from his hospital would be seen as a complaint, and would land him in trouble as the facility likely had none. “Buying it was much easier than prison,” he said. “This is a tradeoff between money and freedom.”All the medical workers interviewed said news of arrests or threats had a chilling effect, intended to make them reconsider voicing their own concerns. “They don’t have to arrest everyone who is talking,” said the Giza doctor. “They just have to arrest a few and the rest fear to do the same. These doctors don’t want to face the same fate.”A spokesman for the Egyptian health ministry and the head of Egypt’s State Information Service did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fde8fdfd254deb0ea4afd0d753d96771dfc9f50b/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=979d766e08278dd63de6e4f376abd07e","title":"englands covid 19 frontlines the race to prevent local lockdowns","story":" went to Lancashire and Liverpool, two areas where infection hotspots are emerging, to watch health directors and their teams at workAt the end of last week, the race was on. Blackburn with Darwen council was identified as an area of “concern” by Public Health England.With the number of infections rising,an emergency meeting of the Local Resilience Forum, which brings together NHS, councils across Lancashire, emergency services and other agencies, was called last Thursday to devise a plan.After the meeting, Blackburn’s public health director, Profe Dominic Harrison, told the  he was determined to stop the outbreak without resorting to a Leicester-style lockdown. “A lockdown of the whole borough would be entirely inappropriate and wouldn’t be a solution to the problem we’ve got,” he said.“What we are seeing there is household transmission in multigenerational households in BAME communities. And in lower income areas, areas of smaller terraced housing.”Harrison believes the virus is spreading through daily trips to cramped shops and through large family gatherings. He is working with imams and community leaders to make videos and deliver leaflets to homes.While government guidance allows two families to gather under one roof, the area has asked its residents to be more cautious, with no more than two people from a second family joining a gathering. Army swabbing units are being sent to the borough, one of which will tour the busiest shopping streets. But Harrison is in a difficult situation. More testing will mean more positive cases.“It’s quite likely the government is going to say: ‘You aren’t doing a good job in your area, we are going to have to intervene.’ So we are briefing them.”Harrison has asked the Department of Health and Social Care what the trigger might be. By Tuesday he had yet to receive a reply.Across the UK, while reported infections are trending down, local outbreaks are emerging. With pubs, restaurants, gyms, pools and hairdressers open, the risk of transmission has increased. There are patterns – those most at risk are living in poverty, in crowded housing, and in areas with traditionally poor health and large minority ethnic communities.Until a vaccine is found, the work done by councils will be critical to preventing local lockdowns of the kind imposed on Leicester.Last week, the  travelled to Liverpool and Lancashire, two areas where infection hotspots are emerging, to watch health directors and their teams at work. The pressure on this frontline is intense there are concerns about a lack of money, and a lack of data that makes people feel they could be flying blind at a time when they need to be extra vigilant.It is Friday evening and Matt Ashton is preparing for another busy weekend. After spotting a spike in coronavirus infections to the south of Liverpool, the city’s health chief has asked for the army to send in a mobile testing unit.Like his father before him, Ashton is director of public health for the city in which he was raised. He moved over from nearby Sefton on 1 April – mid-pandemic. Before Covid-19, most people had no idea what he did for a living, but perceptions have changed. “Suddenly we’re important again,” he says.Liverpool’s weekly tally of residents testing positive has been ticking up, from about 20 in mid-June to more than 50 last week. For six consecutive days, it was on a red list of councils where new cases are exceeding government forecasts. The latest data showed a dip, thankfully, but nobody is being complacent.Ashton’s office was on high alert after the “super Saturday” pub reopening. “We called it ‘steady Saturday’,” he says. “We tried to rebrand it.”In the run-up to the weekend, he had persuaded Liverpool football club manager Jürgen Klopp to let him open a pre-match press conference. The man from the council urged fans to watch the Aston Villa game from home. Everyone was keen to avoid a repeat of the celebrations that had seen the streets filled with raucous crowds celebrating the club’s Premier League title.Liverpool is England’s fourth largest city and its public health director’s budget has fallen by a quarter in real terms since 2013, when a reorganisation led to the role being transferred from a national agency into local councils.There have been two tranches of extra cash from the chancellor during the pandemic, but Ashton’s team has still been asked to find a further £2m in savings out of an annual spend of £45m.Over the last month, the council has been managing an average of nine outbreaks at any one time – outbreaks are defined as two or more cases in a single setting, and Liverpool has had them in hospitals, prisons, and now schools. Classes at three separate schools have been asked to quarantine. Entire families cannot leave their homes for two weeks, and food is being brought to them.In preparation for the second wave, Ashton’s team are busy mapping high risk workplaces – large warehouses, factories and food processing plants. So far there have been no work-related outbreaks reported, but this may be because the data needed to spot them just has not been available. Public Health England (PHE), the national agency responsible for disease control, only began sending out postcode level details on new positive cases at the end of June.Councils are still clamouring for better information. They want new cases by household, not just by postcode. And they need it daily – ideally in real time. At present, the postcode data arrives once a week, so the information is often seven days old. Details on workplace and ethnicity are often missing.“If we have full access to data, we are not just waiting for outbreaks to occur, we are anticipating when and where outbreaks will occur,” says Ashton.From the beginning, there has been a reluctance to share information from the centre. PHE originally refused to release forecasts. This left councils struggling to plan for morgue capacity, extra hospital beds, and discharges into care homes.Ashton turned to the University of Liverpool for help. A team there is now preparing a health information dashboard. It is part of a wider project to create a civic data cooperative.“We are trying to drag content back so it’s a public asset,” says Paul Brant, Liverpool’s cabinet member for health. “We don’t want it all given over to Google for their own personal gain. The benefits should flow back to the public and it shouldn’t be used against them.”The new postcode data has already allowed Ashton to spot a spike in cases among young people in the suburb of Woolton, where there have been reports of parties in the woods and large gatherings on street corners. On Saturday, army “swabbers” were sent in so that residents could get checked without having to book an appointment.“The fact we’ve got a mobile testing van popping up might make people realise how serious this is and help alter behaviour,” he says. Plans are already under way to contract private companies instead of soldiers to man the mobile units.For Sakthi Karunanithi, more local control cannot come too soon. Lancashire county council’s public health director wants to offer testing to people living on the margins, to drug users, homeless shelters, domestic abuse refuges and probation hostels.He is battling on two fronts – residual levels of the disease in some areas, and lockdown fatigue causing new flare-ups. “The message is getting lost. We need to rethink about how we reach people – without unduly affecting what is already a scarred economy.”With a population of 1.2 million, the county is England’s poorest, demographically. Local jobs are heavily dependent on the aerospace industry, which has gone into free-fall since the world’s airlines were grounded. Engine maker Rolls Royce has already announced redundancies in the area.On Thursday, the Lancashire team gather for a zoom call. It is a blizzard of statistics. In the last 24 hours, they have been notified about a record five new complex cases. In Pendle, there is a problem at an engineering company where six staff are ill. An outbreak at another engineering firm and one at a call centre are now under control. Overall, the team are dealing with 22 incidents and outbreaks at hospitals, schools, care homes and workplaces.Each new complex case requires a file. A team is assembled, with a public health consultant from the council, staff from PHE, environmental health, and the workplace manager. In a care home, a case can only be closed 28 days after the last positive test.According to protocols, councils should be notified of complex cases by PHE, but more often than not the information comes first through local networks. Lancashire has a team which rings every care home manager daily – there are 425 in the county.Karunanithi worries about gaps in the contact tracing system too. The national helpline, billed as “world-beating” by the prime minister, has a team of 25,000 call handlers, but it is missing cases. The engineering firm in Pendle appears not to have been contacted by contact tracers or by PHE, for example. Lancashire is doubling its infection prevention team so that it can fill the gaps.For its part, PHE says it is keeping pace. It has added 380 staff to its health protection and field services teams since the start of the outbreak, with 870 people now working in those areas.“We are committed to transparency and are continuing to make increasing amounts of data available to local authorities,” says PHE’s medical director, Yvonne Doyle. “Every local outbreak we are aware of has been investigated.”In theory, the national helpline has enough staff for 400 call handlers to be focused just on Lancashire, but the county has no means of contacting them. “We would love to know who they are so we can get in touch,” says Karunanithi, “What we really need is much more joined up working between the levels.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b627ea797fe4711fc8082d03a7ba152ed573535/32_120_754_453/master/754.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72e409621cb83f63d598b23003a24810","title":"english councils backpedal on cycling schemes after tory backlash","story":"‘Cycling revolution’ at risk as local Conservatives lobby to remove funded cycle routesThe “cycling revolution” promised in the aftermath of the pandemic is under threat as councils across England have withdrawn schemes following objections from residents and local politicians.While Boris Johnson talked in parliament of a creating a “golden age” for cycling in May as part of plans for the overhaul of cycle routes, it appears that not all of them are running smoothly. has identified six councils – Ealing, Wandsworth, South Gloucestershire, Trafford, Portsmouth and Surrey – where funded cycle routes have been cancelled.A number of Conservative politicians have been campaigning against emergency active travel plans.The Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, Rupa Huq, has also voiced opposition to a low-traffic neighbourhood in her constituency, calling for the “madcap scheme” to be scrapped.Huq said: “To clarify, I support schemes to encourage walking and cycling. The plans are well-intentioned but the overall scheme badly thought through and looks to be pushed through with no consultation.”Ealing council later said the scheme would be cancelled due to planned utility works in the area.In some areas, residents who oppose new cycle routes have taken matters into their own hands. In Lewisham, a movable bollard and sign marking a road closure were vandalised, while in Croydon, planters marking out a road closure were removed.Ruth Cadbury MP, the co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for cycling and walking, said: “Safe cycling and walking should not be a postcode lottery, and we are very supportive of councils that are being brave and trialling challenging schemes.” analysis of historic Transport for London consultations shows cycle schemes have often been withdrawn or altered following consistent objections from Conservative politicians, taxi drivers’ organisations and residents associations in wealthy areas.A review of 1,740 stakeholder responses to TfL’s public consultations on 83 new cycle routes between 2013 and 2019 found:Sir Alan Duncan MP, the former minister of state for Europe, was one of several Conservative politicians who opposed a new cycling route over Lambeth Bridge. He said in his response he wanted to protect :a unique remaining Georgian corner of Westminster”.He said: “TfL’s design work is a blight on London. No adequate thought is ever given to the aesthetics of the streetscape, and the proliferation of a forest of horrid-looking signposts is a disgrace.”These included residents’ groups in some of London’s most expensive neighbourhoods. The members of Chester Terrace Residents’ Association live in a Grade I-listed building overlooking Regent’s Park, where average property prices are £6.7m. The association objected to plans for a new cycle superhighway, claiming the scheme would cause congestion in the area. The CS11 route was later cancelled after Westminster council took legal action against TfL.There is little evidence that segregated cycle lanes in London have increased congestion. TfL statistics on cycle superhighway routes have shown they increase efficiency by carrying more people per hour, and congestion is similar to pre-construction levels.Simon Munk, of the London Cycling Campaign, said: “There is a real failing of political will when it comes to cycling schemes. Too many politicians are effectively mirrors for what their residents say, but there is a particular skew among people that respond to a consultation.“Who has time to put pins in an online map? Who has time to read through 200 pages of documents? If you live in a wealthy area, you are used to raising your voice and having it heard.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8fe78d60e8d0b6a6a7ff07cdb64a16bbf803d85/150_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6cf5e1f0dc679ae8fdee5ff3c8f34098","title":"revealed the inside story of europes divided coronavirus response","story":"Exclusive: A litany of failings meant that when Italy faced disaster, its distress call to the EU met with a shocking silenceby  Daniel Boffey Celine Schoen, Ben Stockton and Laura MargottiniIt was a moment of chilling clarity. On 26 February, with the numbers of Italians known to be infected by coronavirus tripling every 48 hours, the country’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, appealed to fellow EU member states for help.His hospitals were overwhelmed. Italian doctors and nurses had run out of the masks, gloves and aprons they needed to keep themselves safe, and medics were being forced to play God with the lives of the critically-ill due to an acute lack of ventilators.An urgent message was passed from Rome to the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels. The specifications of Italy’s needs were uploaded into the EU’s Common Emergency Communication and Information System (CECIS).But what happened next came as a shock. The distress call was met with silence.“No member state responded to Italy’s request and to the commission’s call for help,” said Janez Lenarčič, the European commissioner responsible for crisis management. “Which meant that not only is Italy is not prepared … Nobody is prepared … The lack of response to the Italian request was not so much a lack of solidarity. It was a lack of equipment.”Some 180,000 European citizens, across the European economic area and the UK, have died from coronavirus and 1.6 million have been infected since the disease crept on to the continent in December last year courtesy of a mystery patient zero.The true number of deaths is almost certainly higher than so far recorded. The recent rise in infections in Serbia and the Balkans are cause for great concern. The continent is now on an unalterable course to the worst economic recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, largely as a result of the lockdowns required to shield its many under-funded healthcare systems.Leaders have been asked fundamental questions about the purpose of the European project when states fail to come to each other’s aid at the darkest times. This weekend the EU’s 27 heads of state and government will meet in Brussels for the first time in person for five months to try to plot a way forward.Today, through both analysis of internal records and interviews with dozens of EU officials and experts in both Brussels and the bloc’s capitals, the  and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism can tell the full story of how Europe emerged to be the WHO-designated “epicentre” of a global pandemic and what key lessons might be learned.It is a story of well-meaning officials in Brussels speaking in urgent tones of an impending disaster to empty press conference rooms. Of increasingly desperate health ministers unable to convince their heads of government and finance ministries of the scale of what was coming and the imperative to act. Of governments belatedly recognising the speed at which the virus was spreading, only to rush into uncoordinated acts of protectionism in moments of ill-concealed panic. And of EU institutions and agencies in which central figures either lacked the experience or powers to get capitals to act together in the face of a disease with respect for neither borders nor the glacial pace of Brussels’ bureaucracy. It is the story of an EU caught ill-equipped and institutionally incapable of mounting an adequate response to the crisis that so swiftly engulfed it.It was as millions of Europeans prepared for their New Year’s Eve celebrations that officials in the Stockholm office of the EU public health agency, the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), first received notice of a cluster of pneumonia cases in China of unknown origin.Established in 2005 in reaction to the Sars outbreak two years before, the ECDC offers scientific advice. It can do no more. Responsibility for health remains entirely with the national governments of the EU, and not in the European commission or its agencies. Despite its limitations, the ECDC’s job is to look to the full European horizon, and call the alarm whether capitals listen or not.The initial concern was how to keep the disease outside the EU’s borders. On 17 January a first coronavirus conference call was held by another EU body born out of previous health crises – but again lacking the powers retained by the national governments.The European commission’s health security committee comprises health ministry representatives from each member state and has had responsibility for coordinating cross-border health threat responses in Europe since the H1N1 influenza outbreak of 2009.But on 17 January, just 12 of the 27 member states, plus the UK, phoned in.Wolfgang Philipp, the head of a small team within the commission’s health department in Luxembourg, chaired the meeting. He told those present that a few dozen people in Wuhan had been infected with a new strain of coronavirus.With 300,000 people expected to travel to Europe from China that month, many to celebrate Chinese New Year on 25 January, the question was what to do about direct flights from Wuhan to London, Paris and Rome.Screening all airport arrivals with symptom checkers and thermometers was believed to be largely ineffective in stopping the spread of the virus, an official from the ECDC told the committee. They instead recommended targeting passengers on the 12 weekly flights arriving in Europe from Wuhan.The UK and France shared information about what they were doing at airports. But there was no update from the Italian government, one of the many absentees. The Italian representative hadn’t noticed the email inviting him to the meeting.The committee had planned to release recommendations on border measures. But those who did attend couldn’t agree. It was an ominous sign of the difficulties the commission would face.Although governments are required to inform the health security committee before implementing measures, unilateral action would repeatedly be taken in the subsequent weeks. The format and short duration of the meetings – typically only an hour with about 100 people attending – would also limit the communication and cooperation possible, sources said.There would be frustration among attendees that some countries were not giving the committee the “weight that it deserves”. Its ability to coordinate effectively was questioned. “There was no time to catch up on events during the time of one week,” the source said. “Events happened at a tremendous speed.”And at the helm of the commission was Ursula von der Leyen, just a few weeks into her job as commission president.The pandemic was a crisis that could have been tailor-made for Von der Leyen, a medical doctor before embarking on a political career that would take her to the German defence ministry. She moved to the EU’s executive branch in December.A significant intellect with steel, according to sources who worked with her during the crisis, but some within the system would come to wonder whether she might have done more in those first weeks. Her first steps were said by some to be tentative. She appeared unsure of the levers she had at her disposal.“The commission should have taken a grip earlier,” said one EU official. “Von der Leyen is clever. But she is new to Brussels and relies on a couple of people from Berlin who also don’t have experience of the commission and what is possible. You don’t ask the member states if they want coordination, you just coordinate. Health is a national competence but you can push things.”If it was a stuttering start by a Brussels novice, the seriousness of what was happening in China was at least understood early in some parts of the commission.“We convened the first meeting of the so called crisis coordination committee on 28th of January,” Lenarčič said. “The commission did take this threat seriously. And we did not change course in our serious approach. Even when voices multiplied out there that ‘all this will just die out’. We even didn’t change the course when some others were toying with the concepts of herd immunity.”A swift decision was taken by the commission to ban its staff from non-essential travel to China and a press conference was called for 29 January to communicate a clear message: get ready.But if the alarm bells were sounding in Berlaymont, the media had other interests. The UK was about to leave the EU after 47 years of membership.“We went to the press conference and the press room was almost empty,” recalled Lenarčič. “We called for preparedness – for all member states to take this seriously and prepare. There was a lot of echo because of the empty room. But we were still hoping that there would be some echo in the media next day. We didn’t find much of that because all the media attention in Brussels was, at that time, devoted to the last session of the European parliament plenary where the UK members participated.”“So a lot of footage of people singing holding hands in the plenary,” Lenarčič said. “I understand that it was a historic moment, it was a sad moment it was emotional moment. But that all does not change the fact that we had something to say on that same day. And we said it, and not many people were interested.”It was not only the newspapers and broadcasters failing to listen to the siren voices from the EU’s executive branch and agencies.The ECDC in the same week advised governments to strengthen the capacities of their hospitals and, in particular, the intensive care units.The urgency of the warning did not hit home in the capitals. “I think what turned out is that they underestimated, in my view, the speed of how this increase came”, said Ammon, a former head of department for Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin who took over the ECDC in 2017. “Because it is a different situation if you have to look for an increase in capacity of beds within two weeks or two days.”Meanwhile, the virus was continuing to quietly seed. On 30 January, two Chinese tourists in Rome tested positive for coronavirus. The Italian government immediately banned all flights to and from China and sought a meeting of EU health ministers to push for stricter entry screening measures across Europe.But the meeting took three weeks to organise. The Croatian government, responsible for convening it as holder of the rolling EU council presidency, had become embroiled in a financial scandal during which the prime minister, Andrej Plenković, had been forced to fire his health minister, Milan Kujundžić. By the time health ministers did finally meet on 13 February, pockets of cases were sprouting.The response to the coronavirus threat had been “prompt and effective” declared the new Croatian minister of health, chairing the council meeting.But an internal ECDC report dated the day after the meeting gave a rather different account, listing a litany of things that were still unknown about the virus and its risks to Europe. The “preparedness status in different member states” was “uncertain”, it read.The stark reality was that in the months and years before coronavirus arrived in Europe, stocks of personal protective equipment (PPE) had dwindled. Emergency supplies of masks had expired, been destroyed and never replaced. Pandemic preparedness plans were out of date.“Several European countries had a strategic stock of masks that were outdated … Most of them were just destroyed,” said one scientific adviser.France held 1.7bn protective masks in 2011, but now had only 117m. Between January and March this year it incinerated 1.5m. In 2017, Belgium ordered the destruction of 38m masks and they were never replaced.No one, it appeared, had a hold on what was out there. Up until 23 February, flights carrying donations of PPE were leaving Europe for China in the hope of containing the virus there. But the unpalatable truth was that Europe itself was exposed.By the weekend of 29 February and 1 March, more than 2,000 people were infected in Europe. In Italy, 35 people had died. Von der Leyen decided to put herself at the forefront of the crisis.She informed Lenarčič that the scale of the crisis required a coronavirus crisis response team of commissioners covering everything from health to the economy and borders.The new team was presented to the public on the Monday. As Von der Leyen walked to the lectern to the click of camera shutters she gestured to the commissioners. “Come on” she was heard to say.Yet within hours, Europeans witnessed one of the biggest failings of the entire pandemic. Now each in full-blown crisis mode, European countries inidually acted to impose restrictions on the export of key medical supplies to neighbours.On 3 March, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, announced that he was requisitioning “all stocks and the production of protective masks”. The next day, the German government banned the export of PPE.A total of 15 member states placed restrictions on the movement of equipment or drugs within the EU during the outbreak. Trucks of masks, gloves and protective gowns were stopped at some borders. European leaders accused each other of undermining EU solidarity and the single market.PPE shipments destined for EU countries that arrived in ports in Germany and France were “very simply stolen”, said a source. The Belgian and Dutch governments meanwhile were buying up the ingredients to make key drugs and delivering them to hospitals to be produced on-site.With a limited supply of these ingredients in Europe, the move hamstrung efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to increase the manufacture of medicines needed to treat the most severe coronavirus cases.By the time European health ministers attended a second council meeting on 6 March, the health commissioner Stella Kyriakides, flanked by Lenarcic and Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market, felt the need to stress the importance of European unity. “I ask you all today to commit to us all working together, openly and transparently, in a spirit of solidarity to ensure a coherent political response,” Kyriakides said.Yet just a few days later Germany unilaterally closed its borders, bringing the continent to a halt, with footage of 50km (31 miles) traffic queues on the German-Polish border dominating the news. The isions of old Europe appeared to be back.“It is not a problem to close the border but you have to talk to your neighbour on the other side of it and some didn’t,” said Lenarčič. “That was wrong and created a lot of problems. First it hampered the flow of goods which is dangerous not only for the functioning of the single market but also for the Covid response because some of those goods are essential like medical equipment, not to talk about food.”There was red-hot anger in the commission’s headquarters. “The commission acted forcefully and immediately in order to persuade all those member states that indulged in such selfish measures,” Lenarčič said.To placate those claiming that there were “people running around Europe with big bags of cash buying everything they could at any price”, the commission agreed to an export authorisation scheme to control what equipment left the bloc, Lenarčič said. But it had been a sobering moment for those with faith in the union. “Things were not done properly.”It was a scenario surely unimaginable even just a few weeks earlier. From 9 March, starting with Italy, and ending on 23 March when Boris Johnson finally followed suit, Europe’s governments shut down their economies one-by-one. Only Sweden went its own way.On 12 March, Von der Leyen’s experts told her the outbreak in Europe couldn’t be stopped. Next day, the head of the World Health Organization declared that Europe was now the “epicentre” of the global pandemic.For the commission, the overriding imperative was to source equipment. Ricciardi, however, recalls his deep disappointment with what then unfolded. “At the time we had desperate need of PPE and ventilators and it was almost impossible to find it on the market,” Ricciardi recalled. “So our call was distribution of what was present in Europe and joint procurement. But it took two months to do that. Not for lack of willingness of the European commission but the process was so slow and bureaucratic. We only had ventilators when our acute situation was over.”The commission had first raised the idea of joint procurement of PPE, of becoming “one big buyer”, in mid-January, but had been faced with a lack of interest from the member states. It was not until 5 February that it was decided to launch a formal assessment of what PPE member states might need.It then took two weeks, and a number of missed deadlines, for governments to hand over the information. By then global stocks had been severely depleted and the member states, waking up to their predicament, were inidually contacting Chinese manufacturers, creating further competition in the market place.By Thursday 12 March, the scheme hadn’t secured a manufacturer. A notice was posted to the EU’s contract database of the failure. It would take two weeks to find one. The first delivery of masks under the scheme was on 8 June.The commission had to take the initiative as it became apparent that the joint procurement scheme was proving ineffective. Emergency legislation was rushed through to allow the commission to build a central stockpile through a scheme called RescEU.While member states would be responsible for procuring the supplies, the commission would manage their distribution and cover most of the costs. Hundreds of thousands of masks have been distributed so far to the pandemic hotspots. And looking to the future, Lenarčič believes this is the model to follow as leaders come together in Brussels on Friday to discuss their seven-year budget and plans for a one-off recovery fund.“In the latest commission budget proposal the funding for health goes from €400m to €9bn,” he said. “The whole logic is give the commission the means to support member states more. Because when Italy asked for help, nobody could give help. We also couldn’t help Italy.” The commission wants to buy equipment for the stockpile rather than rely on the generosity of member states. It wants to expand the type of equipment to cover potential chemical, biological or nuclear crises. “I see one very clear lesson,” Lenarčič said. “There is a wish of an overwhelming majority of the European public to have more Europe on issues like this.”Ricciardi agrees. He also believes the ECDC should be a decision-making body not just advisory at times of crisis, and that the commission has to be given its head when coordination is vital. “The member states must learn that we need to prepare for this new normality – this will only be the first of a series of events,” he said. “We will have it in the future. The patterns of behaviour, trade and tourism, are changing around the world. And if we don’t realise this we are going to be seriously disappointed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/829cbc732bb068a55733452e4c4662a2709e55cc/0_0_3000_1997/master/3000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c210181c4ef9a8c73ea6eefc8d1d789 700w","title":"coronavirus live news update covid 19 cases latest updates india lockdown","story":"160,000 Catalans back into lockdown Florida records new daily death toll high India Covid-19 cases top 900,000The World Health Organization said on Wednesday that it was “concerned” about reports of pneumonia in Turkmenistan, a closed Central Asian country that has yet to declare any coronavirus cases.WHO’s Senior Emergency Officer for Europe Catherine Smallwood recommended the government adopt measures including contact tracing “as if Covid-19 were already circulating.”“We are aware of and concerned of reports of acute respiratory disease or pneumonia,” Smallwood said.She credited the government’s “recent activation of stronger measures” as part of efforts to prevent the potential spread of the virus in the country.Turkmenistan on Monday began apprehending citizens for not wearing masks after the health ministry warned of “high concentrations of dust” and “pathogens” in the air.The US has seen 67,000 cases in a single day – the highest number in 24 hours so far.

Lari said the country had recorded 13,410 deaths overall, with 199 in the past 24 hours.She said a further 2,388 people had also tested positive for Covid-19, raising the total cases confirmed to 264,561.Amnesty International has estimated that more than 3,000 health workers have died globally, although it says the figure is likely to be a significant underestimate. It found the US, Russia and the UK (when social care workers are added) to have the highest death tolls among health workers.Levels of childhood immunisations against dangerous diseases such as measles, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped alarmingly during the Covid-19 pandemic, putting millions of children at risk, United Nations agencies said today.In a joint report with Unicef, the World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros, Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned: The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunisations could be far greater than Covid-19 itself.Three-quarters of 82 countries that responded to a survey for the report said they had suffered coronavirus-related disruptions to their immunisation programmes as of May 2020.Most problems were linked to a lack of sufficient personal protection equipment (PPE) for health workers, travel restrictions, and low health worker staffing levels - all of which led to immunisation services being curbed or shut down.At least 30 measles vaccination campaigns have been or are at risk of being cancelled, threatening new outbreaks of the contagious viral disease this year and beyond, the report said.Measles outbreaks were already on the rise, infecting nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killing 140,000 of them - mostly children, according to WHO data.For diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 “points to a substantial drop” in the number of children getting all three doses of the DTP vaccine that protects against them, the report said - the first time in 28 years that the world could see a fall in coverage for this routine childhood immunisation.The report said progress on immunisation was already stalling before the new coronavirus emerged and spread around the world, but the pandemic made a bad situation worse.Austria will lift its travel warning for Lombardy, the region at the centre of Italy’s coronavirus outbreak, because of a fall in infections, Austria’s foreign ministry said today.The relaxation could pave the way for the resumption of flights between Lombardy’s capital Milan and Vienna, since such travel warnings come with a ban on direct connections.Austria lifted controls, thereby allowing land crossings, at the shared border a month ago, three months after they were introduced when Italy’s outbreak worsened.“The epidemiological development of the province, which was hit first and particularly hard by the pandemic, now makes this step possible,” Austria’s foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that the travel warning would be lifted tomorrow.The coronavirus has killed approximately 35,000 people in Italy, the fifth highest number in the world after the United States, Brazil, Britain and Mexico. Austria, by contrast, has reported just 710 deaths so far.The EU’s public health body is assessing risks posed by ventilation systems and other settings at workplaces for the transmission of the novel coronavirus through the air, in addition to through droplets, its head said. From Reuters:The announcement by the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDP) could show a commitment tackling the potential spread through fine airborne mists known as aerosols, which the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged as a possible danger only last week.While the virus is believed to spread mainly through contaminated droplets, Europe’s ECDC has long warned it might also spread through the air in mists. That could pose extra risk in enclosed spaces, especially with poor ventilation, risks that could rise in winter as people spend more time indoors.Andrea Ammon, who chairs the ECDC, told Reuters there was still no evidence to show what proportion of cases were spread by aerosols rather than droplets, but “we know both are a possibility”.Last week, the WHO said the virus could spread through aerosols, although it stopped short of saying this had been confirmed. The global health body had come under pressure from scientists, who wrote a letter calling on it to acknowledge the potential for airborne spread.Ammon said the ECDC was assessing risks in the workplace, which would be heightened by airborne transmission, after several localised outbreaks in plants throughout Europe, with the most serious in a slaughterhouse in Germany in June.“We are working on a technical report on occupational settings and risk factors for such outbreaks,” she said, adding dangers posed by ventilation systems were being assessed.Many of the social distancing and hygiene guidelines that countries have adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic are based on preventing contact with droplets of saliva or mucous expelled by carriers of the virus when they cough, sneeze or speak. Preventing airborne spread could require other strategies.Ammon said the ECDC still assumes droplets are the most common vehicle of transmission. She said there was no need at this stage to update the agency’s guidance, and reiterated that it was crucial that people continue to respect social distancing rules and wear face masks.The European commission said today that European Union states should launch earlier and broader vaccination campaigns against flu this year to reduce the risk of simultaneous influenza and Covid-19 outbreaks in the autumn, Reuters reports.The EU executive wants to prevent the risk of hospitals being again overwhelmed by a surge of patients, as happened at the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Europe in March and April.“Simultaneous outbreaks of seasonal influenza and Covid-19, would place a considerable strain on health systems,” it said in a document which lists actions needed to prepare for a possible large second wave of Covid-19 in the autumn.It called on EU governments to bring forward flu vaccinations to the summer. People in Europe usually get their annual flu shots in the autumn.Brussels also urged states to:The commission wants governments to use contact-tracing apps that are interoperable across EU borders but at this stage only 10 of the 27 EU states have launched such applications.Hello, this is Haroon Siddique taking over the blog. You can contact me via the following channels: I’ll leave you with Reuter’s sobering live tracker, following the spread of the novel coronavirus. Not a cheery sign-off, ‘tis true, but a sign-off nonetheless.Reuters is reporting that the Tokyo Olympics may have to be postponed again if the novel coronavirus mutates into a stronger pathogen.“I think the virus is mutating all the time … it may be a much stronger virus that triggers a second wave,” Kiyoshi Kurokawa, a prominent Japanese government adviser, told Reuters.He also said that a recent increase in cases in Tokyo is due to a failure to stick to guidelines to prevent contagion. A physician who served as a science adviser to the Japanese cabinet from 2006-08, Kurokawa also headed an independent investigation into the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Currently, he is advising the government on the coronavirus pandemic.“I think it’s small incidents happening in Tokyo … new cases are because people are not abiding by recommendations,” Kurokawa said of the increase in infections. “But if there are some mutations, that is a completely different story. That could happen anywhere in the world.”Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike told Reuters on Monday the Olympics, originally scheduled to start this month but put off to 2021 because of the pandemic, must go ahead next year as a symbol of world unity in overcoming coronavirus.Kurokawa was appointed last month to head a panel to examine how to use artificial intelligence to fight the spread of the virus. His appointment to the four-person group including a Nobel prize-winning geneticist came after economics minister Yasutoshi Nishimura abruptly announced he would dissolve a panel of scientific experts and remake it with new members.The move came amid reports of clashes between the health experts and politicians. Kurokawa said that whatever experts recommended based on science, political leaders had to make the final policy call.“The scientific community’s recommendations have to be fact-based, science-based recommendations, but politicians have to make the decisions,” he said. “Scientists give advice, but decision-making is not by scientists.”AP is carrying a story that you really need to read on their site, to see the wonderful photos that illustrate the personal stories, about the artists who perform in the concerts, acrobatic shows, and striptease dance revues that typically entertain thousands of tourists in Las Vegas, as they wait for their venues to reopen. Though casinos have been allowed to reopen with rules about sanitising, social distancing and mandatory face masks, hundreds of performers, including those who’ve come to the city from all over the world, are waiting in Las Vegas for the shows and crowds to return. As they wait, they try to keep their bodies in top form, practise their skills and find a way to perform.Melissa James, a dancer and aerialist in the show “Extravaganza” at Bally’s casino-resort, said it was heartbreaking when, after weeks of grueling rehearsals, Covid-19 closures shut down her show after its debut night in March.Since then, she said, “we’ve kind of just been waiting here, trying to stay in shape and stay fresh and ready, should we get the go-ahead that shows will allowed again”.While largely quarantining at home, James said she does circuit workouts to keep up her stamina and uses equipment at home and a recently reopened circus training space to work on strength and aerial skills. To stay inspired, she practises ballet and works on choreography.“As artists, we’re not sitting here cooling our heels,” she said. “Every day we’re trying to be creative.”Reuters is reporting that 160,000 people in the Spanish region of Catalonia returned to confinement today as authorities scrambled to control a fresh surge of coronavirus infections in the area, weeks after a nationwide lockdown was lifted.A judge finally approved the regional government’s stay-at-home order for residents of the city of Lleida and six nearby towns last night after several days of legal wrangling and political tensions over the issue.Under the new rules, people may only leave their homes for essential activities like working or buying supplies, while hotels, restaurants and bars will close except for food pick-up or delivery.Regional authorities have also encouraged the residents of three neighbourhoods in L’Hospitalet, a Barcelona suburb that is home to around 260,000 people, to stay home, but that’s not a mandatory confinement. Another judge refused to rubber-stamp a proposed restriction on gatherings of more than 10 people there.After more than 28,000 deaths from the pandemic, Spain’s government ended a nationwide lockdown on 21 June, considering it had dealt with the worst of the virus as the number of contagions had ground to a near halt.But since then, more than 170 clusters have sprung up around Spain, prompting regional authorities to impose a patchwork of local restrictions, confusing locals and angering businesses.Our very own Damian Carrington is reporting that a nature-led coronavirus recovery could create $10tn a year.A World Economic Forum report says 400m jobs could be created - and warns there will be ‘no jobs on a dead planet’The report also warns that when the world recovers from the coronavirus pandemic there can be no business-as-usual, with today’s destruction of the natural world threatening over half of global GDP. In 2019, scientists warned that human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems.The report, from the New Nature Economy project, published by the WEF, says a nature-first approach from business and political leaders will be a jobs-first solution.

It is understood concerns were raised at the emergency team by multiple participants regarding the current trends in infection rates in the country, as well as uncertainty over how the virus will behave. There is significant concern among the team over how these trends could interact with an increase in congregated settings reopening. It is thought that some recent clusters of the virus have been linked to congregated settings already permitted to be open under earlier relaxations of restrictions. Travel restrictionsThe Government will now consider these matters at a key Cabinet meeting scheduled for Wednesday evening at which moving to the next phase of reopening the economy will be discussed. There are also ongoing concerns on the emergency team over the incidence of the virus linked to travel, which will play into the Government’s upcoming decisions on travel restrictions. It comes as the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed that more than 300,000 public servants will have to take leave – including unpaid leave – to self-isolate if they go out of the country on non-essential business under new guidelines for the public sector.Public servantsThe guidelines, which will be published on Wednesday by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, state that when there is an intention to undertake non-essential travel overseas, “all employees must make provision by way of an annual leave or unpaid leave application for the additional period of self-isolation”.The rules will effectively rule out any foreign holidays planned by hundreds of thousands of public servants. There is also a requirement that employees advise their employer of travel abroad, which the department guidance states “is necessary for the protection of public health”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Only one fatality from Covid-19 has been reported in the North in the past 10 daysSupreme Court appeal by seriously ill man who worked in Ireland for three years failsThe appointment means the west of Ireland now has a senior Cabinet MinisterFrench authorities seeking his surrender in relation to the death of Sophie Toscan du PlantierVetting of proposed ministers \u0026lsquoalways carried out\u0026rsquo, says former minister of stateLow rate of monitoring will cause serious concern about State\u0026rsquos ability to detect imported cases of diseaseTD \u0026lsquosurprised and disappointed\u0026rsquo move comes amid continuing controversy over drink driving banGreen Party leadership candidates spoke at final hustings of the campaign on TuesdayJournalist was shot dead in Creggan, Derry in April 2019A cloudy and misty start on Wednesday will make way for dry and warm sunny spellsConstituents in tourist areas are worried about perceived lack of control on travel, say DeputiesThree overseas passengers refuse to fill in \u0026lsquolocator forms\u0026rsquo amid call for clampdownTroops allege they suffered post-traumatic stress disorder following 2013 attackDoctors report \u0026lsquodistinct change\u0026rsquo in public mindset and attitude to tests in recent weeksGovernment should lock down local areas with high Covid-19 rates, group saysPublic health team fear virus may accelerate if extra congregated settings are availableOffaly TD also refused to make second public statement about drink-driving banStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305054.1594805910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"catherine martin and eamon ryan clash on experience in final green hustings","story":"The two candidates contesting the Green Party leadership have differed markedly on whether experience is essential for the role.Deputy leader Catherine Martin told the final hustings of the campaign on Tuesday night that while experience was a valuable attribute for a leader, it was not a prerequisite.In contrast, party leader Eamon Ryan focused almost wholly on his extensive experience in government and as party leader in his opening remarks, in areas such as climate change, energy, transport, and land use.Ms Martin made a deliberate pitch questioning the primacy of experience, an issue that had been frequently mentioned in previous hustings. She suggested that the quality had been overemphasised and said that experience sometimes acted against decisions that required risk or radical departures.Ms Martin said the leader should be a risk-taker, and also suggested the Greens would pull out of government if the programme for government was not fulfilled.“It’s the greenway or the highway”, she said.Mr Ryan said directly he wanted to stay on as leader of the party he has led since 2011. “I want to stay on as leader. I want the job,” he said.Both Mr Ryan, now Minister for Transport, and Ms Martin, now Minister for Arts and Culture, responded to questions from members in the north west and from Northern Ireland.In response to a question from Northern Green leader Claire Bailey, Mr Ryan said she had been responsible for the important change in language, that say the “united Ireland” unit in the Department of the Taoiseach changed to the “shared island unit”.Ms Martin said thee were two traditions, one island and one plant and she as a Green did not “want physical borders.”Asked by Saoirse McHugh about bullying in the party, Mr Ryan said it started with each inidual and how they deal with others.“I hope I have never engaged in a way that is antagonistic,” he said.He said that during the last turbulent while, there had been online “heightened emotion, and bullying and abusive behaviour” not just in the Greens but all over the world.He said the party had been “swamped” by this issue.“We have a mechanism that is fit for a party of one or two TDS and not 12. We are not coping to be honest.“One of the first tasks in the convention coming up is that complaints will be dealt with very quickly and dealt with very fairly,” he said.Ms Martin Catherine said bullying was an “extraordinary issue and should not be part of our organisation.”She said she wanted a party where dissenting voices feel comfortable. “It needs to be clear that differences of opinion will never go against you,” she said.“We have to have clear processes in place where people who feel they are bullied feel safe on how to report it.”Both differed in responding to a question from Northern Ireland suggesting Ministers, and Taoiseach’s Seanad nominees, should be appointed by the party membership.Ms Martin said it was an issue that required reform and examination. Mr Ryan said that “as leader you are three to make a call”. He said that many of those decisions, including which portfolios go to which parties, were taken at the last minute and “going back to the executive would be difficult.”Ms Martin, in her closing speech, said she was ready and eager to lead the Green Party. “I am asking you to choose a new energy and a new leader,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305105.1594821900!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mayo td dara calleary appointed minister for agriculture replacing barry cowen","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has appointed Mayo TD Dara Calleary as Minister for Agriculture, after Barry Cowen was sacked last night over the ongoing drink driving revelations. Video: Oireachtas\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMr Calleary’s initial appointment as government chief whip shocked many, including himself. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillHe also intends to appoint Jack Chambers as Government Chief Whip and Laois Fianna Fáil TD Sean Fleming to replace Mr Chambers as Minister of State at the Department of Finance. He will seek Cabinet approval for these appointments on Wednesday evening.Mr Fleming will have responsibility for financial services, credit unions and insurance. Mr Martin later clarified when asked by Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty that Mr Chambers would also have responsibility for the Gaeltacht.The moves follow the sacking of Fianna Fáil TD Barry Cowen as Minister for Agriculture on Tuesday night, amid continued controversy after it emerged he had had a drink-driving ban.On Wednesday, Mr Cowen arrived into the upper gallery of the Dáil session taking place in Dublin’s Convention Centre, just as the debate ended on the new appointments. He spoke to a number of his Fianna Fáil colleagues, observed proceedings for a few minutes, and then left the gallery with party colleague John McGuinness.During the short debate on the appointments the Taoiseach said that Mr Calleary would be a “very effective Minister” and that he will deliver on challenges facing the agriculture sector, including Brexit, climate change and the renegotiations of the EU Common Agricultural Policy.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan told the session there were real issues about how people’s personal private data was put out in public. He also said there was a “high bar” for standards in the political system. He said the current controversy had been a difficult political and personal issue, but he believed the Government would work “cohesively”.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said they could not forget that the new appointments had been made arising from a major controversy.She said people remembered previous Fianna Fáil governments and their failure to answer questions. The party was back in Government and “here we go again”, she added.Labour leader Alan Kelly said that it has not been a good start for the Government. He told the session he hoped today would be a “watermark” and that the Government could get on with its job.Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy said there had previously been a lot of attention on the lack of an appointment of a Minister from the west, but she said that “there is no such thing as a minister for the west”. She said there was “something very wrong in politics when that is how it is perceived. A minister can’t be a minister for a region or a certain constituency.”Rise TD Paul Murphy claimed the Taoiseach “colluded with Barry Cowen to keep vital information from the Dáil”.Independent Denis Naughten said he was shocked and really sorry to hear his “neighbour” Barry Cowen had been sacked. Mr Naughten, who resigned as minister for communications in a controversy over the National Broadband Plan, said he knew it was a lonely place to be.Independent TD Marian Harkin noted that politics could be “brutal”, while fellow Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice said that what was in question was “trial by media”.In profile: Dara CallearyDara Calleary’s promotion to the role of Minister for Agriculture has addressed one controversial issue of the new Government – the omission of a senior member of Cabinet from the west of Ireland. Mr Calleary’s initial appointment as chief whip, rather than to a senior ministerial portfolio, shocked many, including himself.He said publicly that he was “angry and disappointed” after what he described on MidWest Radio as “a private and incredibly painful” conversation at the time with Mr Martin.That combined with significant public backlash resulted in responsibility for the Gaeltacht and sport being added to his portfolio.But the Mayo TD has finally, if at the expense of a colleague, been rewarded for playing a key role in the Government formation talks and contributing to keeping all sides on board.The Mayo TD has been in the Dáil since 2007, and was appointed chairman of Ógra Fianna Fáil by then taoiseach Bertie Ahern at the National Youth Conference in Co Offaly in February 2008.The 47-year-old has Fianna Fáil in his DNA. He is the son of late TD and former minister of state Seán Calleary, who served in the Dáil from 1973 to 1992.His grandfather Phelim was TD for Mayo from 1952 to 1969.Affable and steady, and highly popular with party colleagues, Mr Calleary is viewed as a safe pair of hands.His skill with people and diplomacy was used as justification for his appointment as chief whip, where an ability to cajole colleagues and ensure turnout for votes is crucial.The chief whip has been called the gatekeeper of Cabinet. Mr Calleary said he would be that gatekeeper and also “a gatekeeper for the west”.He pledged to be a voice for the west at the Cabinet table and one that “will not be a quiet voice”. His constituents and others will now have an expectation of benefits for the region.He has had a previous taste of government when he served as minister of state for labour affairs and public service transformation from 2009 to 2011 in the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition.A graduate of Trinity College with a degree in business and politics, his earlier education was at St Oliver Plunkett National School and St Muredach’s College.He previously worked with Chambers Ireland and in an Irish bank.He has served as his party’s spokesman on justice, equality and defence, as well as its spokesman on jobs, enterprise and innovation."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4305124.1594821603!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach was left with no alternative but to sack barry cowen he tells d%C3%A1il","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            An Taoiseach Micheal Martin arriving for the Dáil sitting at the Convention Centre Dublin this morning.

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill Taoiseach Micheál Martin told the Dáil on Wednesday he was left with “no alternative” but to dismiss former minister for agriculture Barry Cowen after he refused to make a statement to the House about the controversy over his drink driving offence.Mr Martin sacked the minister in the Dáil on Tuesday night over his refusal to address further allegations that emerged in the media at the weekend. He said the fundamental difference between him and Mr Cowen was that Mr Cowen chose to go the “legal route” to defend his position.“In my view the only route was the political route.”The Taoiseach also rejected claims by Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald that he knew the full “sorry story” over a week ago.The Taoiseach said that “allegations and assertions and media statements are not facts” in relation to claims that Mr Cowen sought to evade a Garda checkpoint – allegations the former minister adamantly rejected.Mr Martin said it was an issue of “grave public controversy” and that he had asked Mr Cowen to come into the Dáil to share his view and clarify issues.He said Mr Cowen did not have access to the Pulse file and Mr Martin only saw it on Tuesday morning when he got a copy at 7.30am. During Leaders’ Questions Mr Martin told Ms McDonald: “Please don’t be asserting that I knew what I knew yesterday morning because I didn’t.“I was fully satisfied yesterday that he should come in before the Dáil,” he said.Mr Cowen said he would reflect on the issue. “As soon as Leaders’Questions was over” he said he asked Mr Cowen again about making a statement “and he still refused to go that route”.Ms McDonald told Mr Martin: “You knew the whole sorry story from the beginning . . . you knew the full story and you failed to act.“You chose to back somebody challenging a Garda record.” She added: “You allowed him to give an incomplete statement to the Dáil” and it “all unravelled completely on the floor of the Dáil”.“It was only when your lack of judgment was exposed that you acted,” she added. “You went from backing to sacking Barry Cowen.”Ms McDonald said he had stood behind his political colleague contradicting a Garda record.Mr Martin said he was not standing by any assertion. He said he read the file and he spoke to Mr Cowen. He said he had never “ in any shape or form” attempted to undermine any Garda record.“I drew my own conclusions,” Mr Martin said, adding that was why he felt Mr Cowen needed to make a statement to the Dáil.Labour leader Alan Kelly said citizens don’t get Pulse files “so it’s really worrying what information you’ve got here” and the premise by which a Government Minister got this information.“How was that information provided,” he asked, adding if that included any detail outside raw data. “Are gardaí named?”, he asked because gardaí are “deeply worried” information they put into a Pulse file will be available at some time in the future.Mr Martin said the implication was that he could act on information provided – but he could not act. He said Mr Cowen was entitled to information about himself.“There was information coming out about speeding fines, and he rang the gardaí to seek access to his own information given that others had it in the media. He is entitled to his own data if others have it,” Mr Martin said. Mr Kelly asked where was the Minister for Justice on this. She was “out tweeting about greenways” but there was not a peep out of her on this, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Labratory tests say teenager died from infected marmotAlmost 4cm-long nematode roundworm is thought to have come from raw fishThousands displaced after heavy rains trigger flash floodingMove after Japan\u0026rsquos capital records highest daily cases \u0026ndash 224 \u0026ndash since pandemic beganInfluential sister of Kim Jong-un says meeting makes no sense without reward for PyongyangMayor was reportedly subject of criminal investigation into sexual assault allegationsBilateral military deal driven by Tehran fury at bombs and arson blamed on US and IsraelBeijing calls on Australia to stop interfering following response to China imposing new security law in territoryGlory to Hong Kong, deemed to contain \u0026lsquostrong political messages\u0026rsquo, can no longer be sung or playedMost deaths have come from hardest-hit Kunamoto prefecturePM\u0026rsquos image undamaged as Bharatiya Janata party proves adept at deflecting blameFor three decades the armies of the two most populous countries have been patrolling a disputed border in the HimalayasDozen people missing on southwestern island of Kyushu as government pledges to boost rescue effortsArmy deployed to patrol the NSW and Victoria borders, closed for first time in 100 yearsFlooding and mudslides on Kyushu force hundreds of thousands to evacuate homesGlobal wrap: Subcontinent overtakes Russia, as border between Australian states to closeNew law leaves pro-democracy protesters unsure of where Beijing has redrawn the lineFourteen presumed dead while dozens remain missing in southern part of countryMore than 75,000 evacuated in southern region after landslides and torrential rainZheng Yanxiong will work with police to stamp out pro-democracy demonstrationsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Cases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4302587.1594542601!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk government announces 700m for britain eu border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December. Photograph: PA WireMore than £700 million is to be spent on building new infrastructure, hiring staff and developing technology to ensure Britain’s border systems are fully operational when the UK leaves the EU at the end of the year.UK cabinet office minister Michael Gove said the major investment would ensure traders and the border industry are able to “manage the changes and seize the opportunities” when the transition period ends in December.The £705 million package includes £235 million for staffing and IT systems, and £470 million for port and inland infrastructure to ensure compliance with new customs procedures and controls.New border infrastructure will be built inland where there is no space at ports, while ports will get one-off financial support to ensure the right infrastructure is in place.Of the £235 million for staffing and IT systems:The funding relates only to the implementation of the mainland Britain-EU border, and the UK government is expected to publish specific guidance and measures for Northern Ireland in the coming weeks.Mr Gove said: “We are taking back control of our borders, and leaving the single market and the customs union at the end of this year bringing both changes and significant opportunities for which we all need to prepare.“That is why we are announcing this major package of investment today.“With or without further agreement with the EU, this £705 million will ensure that the necessary infrastructure, tech and border personnel are in place so that our traders and the border industry are able to manage the changes and seize the opportunities as we lay the foundations for the world’s most effective and secure border.”The transition period is set to end at the end of December 2020, when the UK will leave the single market and customs union.The funding package comes ahead of a public information campaign in which guidance will be given to traders and hauliers explaining what they may need to do to prepare for the end of the transition period.Meanwhile, the Sunday  reported that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is poised to introduce tax cuts and an overhaul of planning laws in up to 10 new freeports.Mr Sunak is said to be planning to open bidding for towns, cities and regions to become freeports – where UK taxes and tariffs will not apply – in his autumn Budget.The paper said the ports will be “fully operational” within 18 months of the UK leaving the customs union and single market at the end of this year. – PAStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Here, we take a look at the locations back under lockdown and how they have chosen different approaches to keeping their populations safe.Key restrictions: A second, six-week lockdown has been introduced in the Australian state of Victoria, home to the city of Melbourne. Citizens will only be allowed to leave home for essential reasons, such as giving care or where working from home is not possible.Restaurants, bars and cafes will have to close but hairdressers may stay open. The border between Victoria and New South Wales has been closed and police say they are setting up  “ring of steel” around the city to prevent movement in and out.Key restrictions: The entire state of California rolled back the easing of its virus restrictions after a spike in cases through the month of June. Although lockdown 2.0 will not be as restrictive as the first iteration, all bars and indoor dining spots have been closed, as well as zoos and museums.In the 30 counties that are on Governor Gavin Newsom’s watchlist, including most of Southern California, gyms, churches, nail salons and other non-essential businesses will also be shuttered. Schools in Los Angeles and San Diego will begin the new academic year online.Key restrictions: Texas Governor Greg Abbott began encouraging people to stay at home in early July following a surge in cases in late June.Masks were made mandatory in counties where over 20 cases were reported and bars were closed, although all other shops and services remain open for now. Restaurants can still serve indoors but capacity has been reduced to 50 per cent. Outdoor gatherings are now limited to 100 people, a reduction from 500.Key restrictions: 250,000 residents in the city of Navotas, one of the 16 cities that constitutes politan Manila, will return to lockdown after just six weeks of freedom. Shops and businesses may stay open, but outdoor exercise will be banned and restaurants will be limited to takeaway services.The mayor of Navotas has requested soldiers be deployed to enforce the lockdown and arrest violators. Navotas is the prime fishing port of Manila and is one of the poorest districts in the capital.Key restrictions: Despite being widely acknowledged as a global success when it comes to curbing the advance of the novel coronavirus, Hong Kong is reintroducing some lockdown restrictions after a small spike in cases. Hong Kong Disneyland will close, cinemas will shut their doors and gyms will put up the shutters.Schools have closed a week early for the summer holidays and gatherings will be limited to four people, down from 50.  Restaurants will no longer offer dine-in services for the first time since the outbreak, with takeaways available after 6pm.Key restrictions: The Moroccan government has ordered a localised lockdown of the northern city of Tangier, cutting off all public transport both in and out. Cafes and public spaces have been closed and masks are mandatory. Tangier is suffering with 20 per cent of all cases in Morocco.As such, citizens of the city may now only leave home for essential reasons, such as to buy food or medicine, and will need special authorisation to travel within the city. Tangier is the second Moroccan city to be placed under a repeat lockdown, after the southern city of Safi was restricted from July 5.Key restrictions: India’s IT hub will enter an initial seven-day lockdown after joining the ranks of New Delhi and Mumbai as the epicentres of India’s outbreak. All transport will be banned except in emergency situations and all non-essential shops will have to close their doors.Places of worship and government offices will close but firms operating in the IT sector that provide back-office services for global corporations may keep their offices open, although they can only run at 50 per cent staffing capacity.Key restrictions: A weekend lockdown will come in to force in India’s most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. For at least the rest of July, the entire state will lockdown all weekend, from 10pm Friday to 5am Monday.All shops and markets will be forced to close, although banks and construction sites will be allowed to stay open, provided social distancing guidelines are enforced. Key restrictions: The northern state of Bihar will enter into a fresh 15-day lockdown to help flatten the curve and reduce the spread of coronavirus. Mass gatherings will stop and public transport will no longer be running.Restaurants may remain open, but only to provide takeaway services, while schools and places of worship will remain shut. After two weeks, the lockdown will be re-evaluated.Key restrictions: Israel has closed all bars, clubs, gyms  and public swimming pools as cases begin to rise for a second time. Restaurants and places of worship will be permitted to stay open, although their occupancy will be reduced in order to help ensure social distancing.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped the new restrictions would be enough to prevent a full lockdown.Key restrictions: Authorities swiftly reimposed strict lockdown measures in the Chinese capital of Beijing after cases of local transmission were linked to the Xinfadi wholesale food market in June.21 residential communities housing 90,000 people were isolated and over eight million people were tested in just a couple of weeks. Key restrictions: Following an outbreak of Covid-19 cases at the Tonnies meatpacking plant, the town of Guetersloh in Germany was placed under quarantine.Approximately 1,500 workers tested positive, prompting bars, restaurants and schools to close. All employees linked to the plant and their families were ordered to stay home even if they had not tested positive for the virus.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"might china react uks huawei decision","story":"A key factor is how quickly China might be willing to allow relations with the UK to deteriorate.Therefore, China may be more likely to want to build on those pockets of support, rather than erode all relationships with the UK entirely, she added.Still, some level of reprisal is likely to take place as Beijing\u0027s swagger has grown with its new wolf warrior style of diplomacy, taking a much harder line in defiance of what it views as the West trying to diminish its place on the world stage.China claimed there were harmful organisms in the shipments and, to this day, the import licenses for Canada\u0027s two largest canola exporters remain suspended.British citizens studying, living and working in China – or other foreigners employed by UK firms – could find themselves facing trumped-up accusations.In June, they were charged with alleged spying and continue to be held largely incommunicado.

The reason seems to be that it makes classics look “elitist” and does the subject, which she clearly loves and does great work for, no favours at all. But surely the real question is: does it make the Great British public vomit?Pauline and June run a small home cleaning service in Newcastle on Tyne. Some time ago I had ordered some wine for an old friend who could not get out, and they said they would deliver it to him.When they came round to pick it up, we started chatting, and the subject of Boris arose. When I revealed that I knew him slightly, they were thrilled, and Pauline proudly whipped out her mobile phone, to show me children shouting “We love Boris, hoorah for Boris”, and such like.This backed up rather persuasively the same conversations that I had had with Davie the postman and other locals in shops, the barber’s and elsewhere. They had no notion that Boris was out to demonstrate to all and sundry just how superior he was by quoting Latin at them and keeping them in their place.Which raises an important question: exactly how often does Boris quote Latin as he talks de haut en bas to the cowering, forelock-touching masses? He certainly uses classical quotations when addressing the alumni of the École normale Superiéure at EU meetings in Paris. After all, it’s their language – French is just a dialect of Latin – and they lap it up, surprised that an Anglo-Saxon knows anything about it at all.But, Professor Beard, is Boris really quoting Latin to hoi polloi every day of the week? What is the evidence? Or is any Latin too much Latin for the “ignorant”? That, to me, sounds like an elitist speaking.This raises another accusation against Boris: that he is not really a classicist. He’s forgotten it all. Indeed, one academic promised to read all of Boris’s books to demonstrate how wrong he always got the ancient world, which tells you more about the academic than about Boris.The point is that Boris adores the subject, and the subject needs classicists outside academe, like Boris, in the wider world, promulgating (as Professor Beard does) their enthusiasm for different languages and cultures. The charity Classics for All has benefitted hugely from his passionate support and that of hundreds of non-academics like him, which has enabled it to get classics – the languages, history and culture – into nearly 1,000 state schools, primary and secondary (and counting), half of them in very deprived areas, across the UK.Is this elitist?

There have been 114 cases in the last two weeks. The authority is third on the list of highest weekly rates – behind Leicester, which has a rate of 118.2 cases per 100,000 and is subject to a local lockdown – and nearby Pendle, with a rate of 76.6. Professor Dominic Harrison, the area\u0027s public health director, said this had triggered a local response, with the establishment of an outbreak control management board and five extra measures introduced.The measures are: household visits reduced to one household plus two members from another household, face masks worn in all public spaces, inspections of small corner shops, asking people not to hug or shake hands on greeting, and increased testing with mobile testing units and targeted testing units.Prof Harrison said the Blackburn with Darwen borough, with a population of 148,000, has two weeks to get the numbers down before lockdown measures are reversed.Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme, he revealed that of the 114 new cases in the area, which has an Asian population of about 28 per cent, 97 were from the south Asian community.Prof Harrison said it was a rising tide event rather than an outbreak, meaning there were cases within specific areas in a significant community but not a single big outbreak.It can have the same effect because it can drive up the cases, but what we are seeing from looking at the postcode data of those cases is, in the last couple of weeks, is that what we are seeing is a single case being infected, then going back to a household and all that household becoming infected, he added.And when we look at the data, what we can see is clusters in a part of the town – but the clusters are household clusters.If numbers are not turning round and going down again by July 27, so two weeks, we are going to then have our next stage, we will go through the lockdown lifting measures and reverse them one by one until the numbers go down.But we\u0027re not going to go from no lockdown and everything open to everything shut, as Leicester has.Council leader Mohammed Khan said: I can reassure all local residents that the council is working with different agencies and organisations across the borough to help get the message out to everyone that life cannot go back to normal just yet, and we must all make sacrifices to avoid a local lockdown.Please continue to do your bit to stick to the rules to protect yourself and your family.In Pendle, people were also warned to stay alert after the authority reported an increase in cases, particularly in Nelson and Brierfield.More

Spain’s newly reopened beaches by placing their towels in advantageous spots.With space at a premium as many resorts impose strict capacity limits on beaches for Covid-19 social distancing, several seaside authorities in Spain have launched a crackdown on the owners of unattended parasols, sunbeds and other holiday paraphernalia.Since beaches reopened in Spain after the country’s three-month state of emergency ended on June 21, authorities have dolled off spaces for users and installed cameras or launched flying drones to help ensure that beaches do not become too crowded.In some resorts, early birds who try to reserve their place in the sun by laying out their towels before they are ready to lie on them are seeing their sunbeds carted away by police and also face fines if caught, or when they reclaim their possessions.Police in the Costa del Sol town of Torrox have already handed out a hundred fines this summer during a crackdown at the resort’s Ferrara beach.“This year we add the Covid-19 issue as an additional reason to be responsible and not leave those items that occupy a space that for reasons of capacity and distance can be used by others,” Torrox council said in a statement.Authorities in Peñíscola, north of Valencia, last week started dishing out fines of up to 750 euros to beach-goers caught leaving hammocks, parasols or other sunbathing gear on the sand, while Malaga’s city council also announced a ban on reserving spaces as well as fines of up to 1,500 euros for the unauthorised erection of canopy structures.But some beachgoers want to see more action against those who hog the best shoreline spots.“Many people just close their parasols and leave their things to go off to eat, so no one will take their place,” users of Sagunto beach complained to the newspaper Levante.Despite Sagunto council having introduced a fine of 150 euros for leaving beach equipment unattended, beachgoers claimed “the police are simply looking the other way” as it was revealed that no fines had been imposed by the start of this week.Increased demand for space with the return of foreign tourists this month after quarantine requirements were dropped for visitors from EU countries and Britain, among others, has seen many beaches forced to close at peak times. Fifteen beaches in Malaga province had to shut temporarily on Sunday to allow for crowds to be eased.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 organisation centre storm","story":"On the 7th of April, Donald Trump tweeted “The W.H.O. really blew it.

Flights can resume from today. Among the first airlines to return will be BA, which has availability on its 1150 departure to Athens tomorrow, and Wizz, which is offering flights to Athens and Crete from Thursday. Tui, Europe\u0027s biggest tour operator, also plans to restart Greek holidays in the coming days. Arrivals in Greece must complete an online form. They may also be asked to undergo testing for coronavirus, but this is unlikely.Malta reopened to tourists on July 1, but only those from selected countries including Germany and Ireland. Britons can head there from today, however. Arrivals do not need to self-isolate, but there are temperature checks at the airport.Travel restrictions have also been eased in Norway, with arrivals from the EU (which, until the end of the Brexit transition period, includes Britain) no longer required to self-isolate. Our reporter Heidi Fuller-Love is in Crete, where business owners are itching to welcome Britons again.Still can\u0027t decide whether to take the plunge and book a foreign holiday?

With quarantine rules waived for a tranche of destinations, summer holidays are here again. Many of the perennial favourites – France, Spain, Italy and Croatia – made the Foreign Office’s restriction-free ‘safe list’ while others – mainland Portugal, for one – remain on the naughty step. But examine that safe list more closely and you’ll notice some exotic names plus several destinations that, while familiar, appear offbeat as holiday choices. You’ve almost certainly heard of places like the Faroe Islands or Liechtenstein. You may have hazy impressions of both. But have you actually visited? Now is the time to go, which is why we’ve compiled this guide to ten unusual destinations you ought to consider this summer. Lucy Aspden reports that tourism businesses in Scotland have reopened for the first time since March, with typically wet weather greeting visitors alongside strict new Covid safety measures.At the Nevis Range, one of the country’s leading outdoor and mountain biking destinations, thermal temperature-checking cameras are in operation in the gondola stations and face coverings are compulsory for all visitors. Those riding on the gondola, which provides access to the summit of Aonach Mor for walkers and bikers, passengers must also wear disposable gloves and only travel with members of their own household.  “Considering it’s a wet day we’re really happy with the number of people who have turned up for the reopening,” said Chris O’Brien, CEO of the Nevis Range. “It’s been a big effort to get everything ready.”Lockdowns are being reimposed in parts of India as local governments try to shield its health system from being overwhelmed.A two-week lockdown that starts on Thursday has been imposed in Bihar, an eastern state with a population of 128 million and a fragile health system. In Bangalore, a key technology hub where offices for major tech companies like Amazon and Apple are located, the government ordered a week-long lockdown that began on Tuesday evening.Read more:  I\u0027ve experienced the world\u0027s strictest lockdown, but I\u0027d rather be here than AmericaIf Florida were a country, it would rank fourth in the world for the most new cases behind the United States, Brazil and India.

Now more than ever, it\u0027s important to reach out and support one another - even in small ways.Airbnb said it was rolling out a personalised kindness cards feature by which people could send messages of appreciation to hosts and attach donations. The move, however, prompted criticism among social media users who argued that those renting out their homes for short-term stays had damaged property markets.The Males reopened to tourists on Wednesday, welcoming its first scheduled international flight for more than three months: a Qatar Airways service from Doha carrying 104 passengers.The stronger our safety measures, the better chance we have of being hailed as a (coronavirus) safe destination, Economic Minister Fayyaz Ismail said as he welcomed the arrivals. I don\u0027t believe that we would need to reimpose a border lockdown.Visitors are not required to be tested or carry virus-free certificates to enter the archipelago. Free tests will be offered to travellers who show symptoms of fever or coughing, the tourism ministry said. They will also be offered a free test when they leave the Males.Thirty-three out of 159 resorts in the archipelago said they would open from Wednesday, but some of them have yet to take bookings. So far, Qatar Airways, Sri Lankan Airlines, Emirates and Etihad have scheduled flights to the Males in July, the airport\u0027s operator said in a statement.Britons who choose to take advantage will be required to self-isolate on their return to Britain unless the Males is added to the FCO exemption list.Passengers disembark from a Qatar Airways plane in MaleLow-cost behemoth Ryanair has criticised ongoing quarantine restrictions in Ireland and says it plans to cut up to 1,000 flights between Ireland and the UK during August and September. Despite the UK and Northern Ireland announcing travel corridors to most EU countries, and the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remaining open, Ireland is still forcing arrivals to self-isolate for two weeks. A spokesperson said: It makes no sense, when governments all over Europe have opened up EU flights since June 1 and removed travel restrictions on intra-EU travel, that the Irish Government continues to treat countries like Germany, Denmark and Greece as if they were suffering similar levels of Covid as the USA, Brazil and India.We call on the Irish Government to remove all travel restrictions between Ireland and the EU … as a matter of urgency, so that Ireland\u0027s hotels, guest houses, restaurants and other tourism providers can recover their business and minimise job losses before we reach the downturn winter period.In addition to enforcing face masks on the beach, Spain has some other curious Covid rules. Its regulations for hotels include:Disinfectant mats at entrances to clean the shoes of guestsGuests can only share lifts with members of their own familyUsed towels must be left in a sealed plastic bag for maids to collectMini-bars are banned unless the hotel can prove they are fully disinfected after every guests departsYou cannot take your key out with you.

Furthermore, another 518,000 workers are believed to be at risk as government support for firms is phased out. Jun Du, Professor of Economics at Aston Business School, said:It will come as no surprise that tourism and hospitality businesses have already suffered a huge blow from Covid-19 and the lockdown restrictions. What our research shows is that the scale of job losses in these sectors, so far hidden by the time lag in official statistics, may already be enormous.The big worry is that the phasing out of the furlough scheme could lead to a further rush of firm closures as reality bites. As such, it can be seen as a ticking time-bomb underneath many thousands of jobs.   While the further measures announced by the Chancellor last week may provide some help to firms, the real issue here is demand. With continued public health fears making many people wary of normal leisure activities, the government must do everything possible to give consumers confidence. This might mean more targeted support for firms, as well as strengthening healthcare infrastructure in tourism-dependent areas.Tom Mulvihill reports that tourists on the Costa del Sol, from today, must wear face masks while on the beach and at swimming pools, with heavy fines for anyone who fails to comply.The strict new rules came into effect at midnight last night, and were part of a wider tightening of restrictions across several regions in Spain in response to isolated spikes of coronavirus infections.Andalucia, home to the popular resorts of the Costa del Sol, has enacted some of the strictest laws in the country, requiring everyone, including beachgoers, to cover their mouths and noses at all times while in public, and with harsh €100 (£91) penalties for anyone caught flouting the rules.However, sunbathers and swimmers will be allowed to remove their masks, provided they stay within their own household or ‘bubble’ or maintain a 1.5 metre social distancing gap with other members of the public.Read the full report.People feeling stressed by lockdown are being invited to let off steam by having their screams played over a loudspeaker in a remote part of Iceland.The offer comes from the Scandinavian nation\u0027s tourist board, which has set up a website allowing people to record themselves venting their frustration.The results will then be played from one of seven speakers set up around the sparsely populated country.Visit Iceland\u0027s campaign is inspired by scream therapy, or primal therapy, which was popular in the 1970s in an attempt to tap into repressed issues and relieve stress and anxiety.Better yet, you could go there and do it for real.

Users will be able to observe changes or detect problems remotely through the representation offered by digital twins.Such advancements could contribute to the trend of people increasingly working and socialising remotely, with video calls replaced with immersive reality communication enabled by next-generation virtual reality (VR) devices and holographic displays.Samsung states that people will not only be able to observe, but also interact with the digital twins. For example, a user could work in an environment on the other side of the world through their digital twin, which could be a representation of a remotely controlled set of sensors and actuators.In order to achieve this, 6G will need to have exceptionally fast data transfer rates and ultra low latency when controlling devices remotely. 6G performance will support a  data rate of 1,000 Gbps, which is 50-times the peak data rate of 5G.But the main user of 6G technology, according to Samsung, will actually be machines. The firm cites estimations that there will be 500 billion connected devices in the world by 2030 – 59-times larger than the expected world population by that time.“As the number of connected machines grows exponentially, those machines will become dominant users of 6G communications,” the paper states.“Looking back at the history of wireless communications, technologies have been developed assuming services for humans as the major driving applications... We expect new 6G technologies have to be developed specifically to connect hundreds of billions of machines taking into account what is required for machines.”Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.ITV commentator Clive Tyldesley says he is “upset, annoyed and baffled” by the decision to replace him as the broadcaster’s senior football commentator.The channel announced on Tuesday that Sam Matterface will step up to replace Tyldesley as their chief commentator, and that although the veteran broadcaster would remain a part of their football plans, he would no longer be the first choice for their England games and coverage of World Cup and European Championship fixtures.The 65-year-old first worked with ITV early in his broadcast career before switching to the BBC in the early 1990s, but retired in 1996 before going on to become their main voice on football, having covered some of the defining European and international moments in the sport’s recent history.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut having first been told of the decision three weeks ago, Tydlesley addressed the decision for the first time in an emotional video on social media, in which he said that he has struggled to understand the reasons for the decision given that he has not been told any.“If you haven’t seen the announcement I am being replaced as ITV’s senior football commentator,” Tyldesley said in a video posted to his Twitter page.Clive Tyldesley replaced as ITV’s chief commentator after 22 yearsTyldesley calls for commentary training after study finds racial biasClive Tyldesley on racism, Twitter vultures and finding the right word“Quite a few people have been in touch with me asking me to react, to comment. I’m not sure that would be a very good idea at the moment.“I was told about three weeks ago so I have had some time to get my head around the decision, but I haven’t got my head around it. To be clear, this is ITV’s decision, not mine, and I’m upset, annoyed, baffled.”The announcement came three days after what should have been the Euro 2020 final, which Tyldesley would almost certainly have commentated on, and he confirmed that there are no plans for retirement or complications with ill health on his side that have have played a factor in the move.“I would have been interested with commentating the Euro 2020 final for them less than 48 horus ago but now I won’t be commentating on any of the big England games in the coming year and I’m going to miss them. I love this job, and it’s gone,” he added.“Why? I don’t know. I do not know exactly why this decision has been taken. Already I’ve had the producer of a broadcaster that I am working on asking me if I have got any health issues. No, I have got no health issues. Asking me if it is something that I have done. No, there’s nothing.“I gather that one or two sites are reporting that I’ve been sacked, well I guess I have from one job but I’ve done nothing wrong. I’m the same broadcaster, the same person that I’ve always been. Like me or hate me and you’re entitled to do either. Like everybody else in football I am a matter of opinion and I totally get that, and I totally respect ITV’s right to change their opinion of me. ITV have been really good for me and yes I’ll carry on as their No 2 commentator.“But let me make it quite clear: I have not stepped down. I have been moved, moved aside. I’ve not even thought about winding down towards retirement or anything like that.”ITV have not given their reasons for demoting Tyldesley for Matterface, with director of ITV Sport Niall Sloane only saying “on behalf of ITV Sport, I would like to thank Clive for his superb work leading our commentary on some of the biggest occasions in world football throughout his outstanding career with us.”Sloane added that ITV are “very glad he will continue with is and look forward to working with him on many more occasions in the future”, but while Tyldesley was keen to stress that he remains in a privileged position given the number of people currently without employment, the pain of losing his his role hurts nonetheless.“Now listen, there are thousands of people in this country facing up to job losses and disappointment that is far more serious than this,” he said. “I am a lucky boy, I love my work and I’ve got plenty on, so I’m not making a statement or anything like that. This is not a grave matter of state, I’m just trying to explain and tell you that I’m really, really disappointed about this. I don’t know why I’m being replaced, I’m well, I’m able, I’m available and I’m just going to miss the England games so much, even more than I miss the Champions League games, and that’s all.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The anomalous figures from South America may be due to the pandemic\u0027s effect on already volatile economies, according to Invezz’s David Merry.“The impact that Covid-19 has had on the industry is huge, the numbers speak for themselves,” he said.Many countries such as Russia and China are down as much as half when compared to last year. However, Covid-19 has also further exacerbated existing geopolitical issues within South America, and this may well have caused an interesting spike in bitcoin trading activity.This trend is only further likely to continue, with many Latin American countries such as Venezuela, now adopting cryptocurrency to help alleviate the issues of hyperinflation.Venezuela actually saw a slight drop in bitcoin trading, however its already high volumes means it is now second only to Russia in terms of trading volume.The country\u0027s economy has been in free-fall for several years, made worse by crippling economic sanctions imposed by the UK and US.Bitcoin overtakes gold to become the best performing asset of 2020Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate hit 10 million per cent in 2019, prompting many people to turn to cryptocurrencies as a more stable medium of exchange.Since 1 June, 2020, an estimated 20,000 shops and businesses in the country now accept payments via bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Marcus Rashford will become the youngest-ever recipient of an honorary degree from the University of Manchester this summer as a reward for his relentless fight against child poverty.The Manchester United forward, whose partnership with Fareshare is providing four million food packages to the most vulnerable in society, successfully forced the government to reverse their decision not to extend the free school meals voucher system last month. The award, which is the highest honour the university can bestow, will be presented later this summer and is also a nod to the 22-year-old’s brilliance on the pitch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“It’s a proud day for myself and my family,” said Rashford, who joins the esteemed company of Sir Alex Ferguson and Sir Bobby Charlton as a recipient. “When you look at the great names that have been awarded this doctorate in the past, it’s humbling. Rashford thrilled after helping raise 4 million meals for vulnerableRashford ends draining week as it started by scrapping it out on left“We still have a long way to go in the fight to combat child poverty in this country but receiving recognition from your city means we are heading in the right direction and that means a lot. Thank you to The University of Manchester.”Rashford, who has 26 goal contributions across all competitions this season, has vowed to continue trying to ensure that no kid in the United Kingdom “has to worry about where their next meal is coming from.” He has already raised £20m through his collaboration with FareShare. University of Manchester President and Vice-Chancellor, Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell, said: “Marcus is an extraordinary young man with an extraordinary talent and drive that stretches well beyond the football field.“His work for charity and his high-profile campaign will not only help countless young people across our own city, but across the entire country.“Our university has social responsibility at its core and this sense of civic pride and duty is something we are proud to share with Marcus. That is why the University is delighted to make Marcus our youngest ever recipient of an honorary degree.”Rashford used his personal experience of relying on free meals as the fuel behind tackling a problem that hits home. “I would be doing myself, my family and my community an injustice if I didn’t stand here today with my voice and my platform and ask you for help,” he wrote in his decisive open letter to MPs last month.“Marcus is an exceptional player and an exceptional person,” said a club representative. “His work with FareShare and his focus on child poverty make him richly deserving of this tremendous honour and everyone at Manchester United is incredibly proud of him.”The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.A teenager has donated more than 3,000 face coverings to The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign to protect volunteers delivering food to the most vulnerable people.Business student James Eid, 19, has given thousands of protective coverings to our appeal partner The Felix Project, which is delivering up to 30 tonnes of food every day to those hit hardest by the pandemic.Mr Eid, who lives in Radlett, was inspired to make face coverings because his grandmother, Anna Ross, 68, has Behcet’s disease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe condition, which causes blood vessel inflammation and has various side effects, also lowers the immune system meaning she is more vulnerable to Covid-19.Mr Eid struggled to obtain low-cost face coverings to protect his grandmother and so, spotting a gap in the market, decided to import specialist production machines and make them himself.How to support our campaignFamilies face ‘summer of hardship’, food charities warnWhat it’s like to volunteer on the frontline during a pandemicUsing money donated by his father, who is joint CEO of food company Signature Flatbreads, the Lancaster University student imported a production line of four machines, naming his new company Signature Masks.The entrepreneur has since opened a factory in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, with production beginning in earnest at the end of the month. To start with, he will make 36,000 face coverings a week, but the size and scope of the factory means he will be able to scale up production and make up to 500 million coverings annually.The coverings are disposable and made up of three-ply non-woven plastic material – meaning they are water resistant and can be worn for up to 24 hours. He will sell the coverings from his website – they will cost £3.79 for 10, or £2.99 if consumers subscribe for weekly deliveries.On donating thousands to The Felix Project, the teenager said: “I want to support those who are helping others in this crisis.” Mark Curtin, of The Felix Project, said: “These Signature Masks will help protect volunteers and staff in our food redistribution warehouses.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I trust people’s good sense.”The cabinet office minister also revealed the government was significantly boosting the manufacture of face coverings, with factories “in Wales and Burnley”.Vaccine doses for all ‘in first half of next year’ if trials succeedThe government has been accused of spreading confusion on the issue, with only 36 per cent of Britons wearing coverings in public places – far short of the numbers in France (78 per cent) and Italy (83 per cent).Some scientists had welcomed the prime minister’s hints at being ‘stricter”, when he said: “We are looking at ways of making sure that people really do have face coverings in shops, for instance, where there is a risk of transmission.”Professor Venki Ramakrishnan, president of The Royal Society, said everyone’s mouth and nose should be covered in public, to reduce the risk of a second wave of coronavirus.The World Health Organisation said last week that there is “emerging evidence” that infections could be spread through particles travelling through the air.Speaking on the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show, Mr Gove said “If tough measures are required, as we have seen in Leicester ... then tough measures will be taken.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We already have it on public transport,” she said.Mr Gove also confirmed the government wanted people to return to work, rather than stay at home, to ensure the “economic engines of this country are fired up again”.“We want to see more people back at work, on the shop floor, in the office, wherever they can be,” he told Sky News.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.The team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers.

But when coronavirus hit in March, Ireland’s biggest sportswear brand had to break the habit of a lifetime and sack its entire 750-strong workforce at its Strabane factory due to the lockdown.With sports events cancelled or postponed, orders from teams and retailers vanished.However, the company was thrown a surprise lifeline when, a day after announcing the layoffs, the Western Health and Social Care Trust approached O’Neills on a Friday about fulfilling a shortage of scrubs to safeguard frontline NHS workers.Factory staff spent that weekend making sample scrubs. By the Monday, O’Neills had secured an order for 10,000 sets of maroon tops and trousers for GPs at a coronavirus testing centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry.As a result, the company rehired 150 workers immediately. It has since brought back more than 400 staff overall as orders from other health trusts across Northern Ireland grew, with the remaining 350 employees being furloughed.The company now produces some 10,000 sets of scrubs a week. Managing director Kieran Kennedy, a veteran of 41 years at the business, says employees have been supportive of the switch from making sporting goods.“We are a close-knit community in Strabane. Many employees know people who work in the NHS and they want to give back,” he explains. “We could either feel sorry for ourselves or be productive and take a bite at the cherry. Without the NHS orders, we would have had no sales and no cash flow. The scrubs kept the show on the road.”Kennedy says the move outside the company’s traditional business area has been relatively easy. For instance, O’Neills had stockpiled a six-month supply of yarn – the raw material for the scrubs and other clothing – from China to hedge against Brexit uncertainty. The company knits the scrubs at its Strabane factory, then dyes and coats them with anti-viral substances at its production plant in Dublin.Workers on the factory floors are social distancing, as well as wearing face masks, sanitising their hands and having their temperature checked.Kennedy is upbeat on the company’s future prospects, noting that big sporting fixtures are returning, which should boost sales and enable him to rehire more workers. But for the foreseeable future, Kennedy plans to continue producing protective gear – an unexpected new revenue stream.   The gift shop owner donating Happy Bags to localsWhen Sarah Lloyd Williams, pictured above, had to temporarily close her quirky little gift shop in Frome on 22 March, she had no idea what she was going to do with the time ahead.At first, Lloyd Williams relished the opportunity to spend every day with her dog, Chester, taking him with other dogs out for walks. However, by nature, she is a hands-on person and soon realised she needed to find something to fill her time other than dog walking and cleaning.She had found out that someone local to her had been having a hard time. “I knew this lady slightly and wondered if there was anything I could do to help, Lloyd Williams explains. I didn’t feel that I knew her enough to contact her offering assistance, so instead I decided to leave a little gift on her doorstep.” She called it a Happy Bag, containing a copy of The Happy Newspaper (a quarterly newspaper by Emily Coxhead containing nothing but good news), a chocolate bar, bath bomb and a little note.This good deed went down very well: the recipient messaged Lloyd Williams to ask if she could buy a Happy Bag for her friend. “I didn’t want any money, Lloyd Williams explains. This was something small that I could do with items that I already sell in Figgins, so I delivered a Happy Bag to her friend and it went from there.”She ended up delivering a number of bags in the local area and it led to doing a few other little things for people, such as picking up medicines, shopping and more dog walking.For Lloyd Williams, this became a lovely way to connect with people that she barely knew, or had never met before, and it made lockdown much easier to navigate: “Giving away some Happy Bags certainly made me feel much happier. It’s a tiny thing, but sometimes that’s all it takes to make someone’s day,” she says.Figgins has now reopened, with Lloyd Williams taking steps to make sure her shop is safer with a screen, hand sanitising stations, floor stickers and limiting the number of people in the shop at any one time. Lloyd Williams is also donating a Happy Bag every week to someone in the local community.At the start of lockdown, Andy Hibbert, above, transformed his car-sharing business.Launched in 2017, Car \u0026amp Away had enabled holidaymakers to rent out their cars from Gatwick and Bristol Airports while they were away, but when the coronavirus forced airports to close, business plummeted.The CEO from south west London quickly decided to use the business\u0027 existing assets to help key workers and launched a new service: Karshare.“We had this burgeoning desire for people to rent their car from home because it was sat there doing nothing,” Hibbert explains. “But then Covid came along. As a business we were stranded. We thought: this is ridiculous. We have all the systems in place to enable us to share cars. Why don\u0027t we launch the car-sharing concept where owners donate their cars to critical-care workers and people who are supporting the most vulnerable in our community?”At the peak of the pandemic, travelling by car minimised viral spread on public transport and limited key workers’ exposure, while making their journeys easier at a stressful time. Karshare encouraged members of the public in Bristol, Brighton, London, Manchester and Leeds to donate their cars for a week to NHS staff and volunteer organisations. The cars were then deep cleaned and matched to local key workers in need of transport.Insurance and road coverage were provided for free, and the owner received a full tank of petrol as a thank you.Impressively, 700 cars have since been donated – including to 31 London NHS trusts – with a total 19,000 days of use. Leasing company ALD donated 30 new cars in Bristol. “We were overwhelmed initially about the donations,” says Hibbert.One key worker who benefited was Michaela Morris, deputy chief operating officer at the NHS Nightingale Hospital London in Docklands. “She was put into a hotel and told she needs to be on call 247, so we quickly found her a car,” says Hibbert. “It’s remarkable that she has been able to continue that work because of the generosity of the public.”Karshare also helped a care worker who had only been able to reach a couple of vulnerable patients a day on his bicycle. When he was loaned a car he could reach up to 11 – and save more lives.While Karshare is now focusing efforts on making the business profitable again, it is also inviting donations to critical workers and will ask for contributions to cover the insurance. Karshare is also being extended to the wider community, allowing people to rent their cars from home.“There are financial pressures for people,” adds Hibbert, “yet they\u0027ve got an asset on their driveway that could really help.”The distillery that swapped gin for hand sanitiserIn the midst of a global pandemic, constrained by lockdown, a fledging gin brand was surrounded by alcohol with no bars open to supply. But reports of hand sanitiser shortages hit the headlines and gave the team an idea.Sean Roche launched Aintree Gin in December 2019. An organic, craft spirit, it takes its name from its home in Merseyside – a village renowned for its famous racecourse which hosts the historic Grand National.By spring, Roche and the team had introduced the gin to over 30 establishments around Liverpool. They were gearing up for the steeplechase, but lockdown put paid to their plans. “As soon as everything started to shut … all of our income went down to zero,” Roche says.Realising online sales would be key, the team started building a website – then they had a brainwave. “News reports started to regularly mention how shortages of… alcohol-based sanitiser were putting NHS and care workers at risk,” says Roche. “We knew that because we were already using pure alcohol to make our gin, we could change our production line to make sanitiser.”Their first batch was ready within weeks. Word got out and, soon after, they were inundated with requests from care homes, hospitals and more, Roche recalls.Volunteers were recruited and more than 600 litres were donated in six weeks. But as supplies ran low, and with no money coming in, the enterprise became financially unviable. “We had two choices,” says Roche. “Stop – or start selling something.”Opting for the latter, new containers were ordered and labels designed so the sanitiser could be sold online. They started offering a range of PPE products too, from face shields to masks. “This created a revenue stream that allowed us to continue,” adds Roche.A PPE pop-up and free hand sanitiser stations at an Asda store followed. “We donated more than we made in profit over the period,” Roche admits.Today, sales are going strong. As businesses look to reopen, many are turning to Aintree Gin for their sanitisation requirements – and also the brand’s primary product. They now aim to supply as many bars and restaurants as possible, and get into supermarkets as well.To read about more inspiring GREAT stories, visit greatbritaincampaigninspirationsWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The results have been hailed as “good news” by Dr Anthony Fauci, America’s leading infectious diseases expert.On Tuesday, researchers reported the findings from the first 45 healthy adults who received Moderna Inc’s experimental vaccine in March, which showed it provided a hoped-for immune boost. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThose early volunteers developed neutralising antibodies in their bloodstream – which are key to blocking infection – at levels comparable to those found in people who survived Covid-19, the research team reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.“This is an essential building block that is needed to move forward with the trials that could actually determine whether the vaccine does protect against infection, said Dr Lisa Jackson, who led the study.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyDr Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose researchers developed Moderna’s vaccine candidate, said: “If your vaccine can induce a response comparable with natural infection, that’s a winner.“That’s why we’re very pleased by the results.”No study volunteers experienced a serious side effect, but more than half reported mild or moderate reactions such as fatigue, headache, chills, muscle aches or pain at the injection site. These were more likely to occur after the second dose and in people who got the highest dose.Moderna was the first to start human testing of a vaccine for the virus on 16 March. In April, the phase 1 trial - which aims to ensure treatment is safe and helps determine an effective dose - was expanded to include adults over 55, who are more at risk of serious disease. Moderna said it would follow volunteers for a year to look for side effects and check how long immunity lasts.The experimental vaccine will start its most important step around late July: a 30,000-person study to find out if the shots really are strong enough to protect against coronavirus.

Mallet was the vice-president of the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents’ Club, which angered Beijing by chairing a talk involving a figure advocating for Hong Kong’s independence. Later, Mallet was also refused entry into Hong Kong as a tourist.The New York Times said its decision came as several journalists were already experiencing work permit issues in Hong Kong, a city that has been seen as a bastion of freedom of the press and a global financial powerhouse. With Donald Trump’s announcement on Tuesday that the US will no longer give preferential trading status to the city, both those statuses now appear under threat.“Hong Kong has been a leader in supporting the rights of a free press in Asia for decades,” said Times spokesperson Ari Isaacman Bevacqua. “It is essential that it continues to do so.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They need our help.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWe can all play a part in saving our towns and cities.If we head out to eat, drink and shop, we can throw a leline to businesses on the edge.It’s our patriotic duty to get back to the pub.For years, town centres have struggled because it is hard for shops to compete with the online retail giants.The switch from old-style shopping to ordering online has sped up in lockdown.The Government’s massive programme of economic support has helped many businesses survive.A total of £.billion in grants has been paid to more than , firms, mainly in hospitality and retail.The Government is also paying the wages of .million people through the furlough scheme.I have heard from small businesses in my Chipping Barnet constituency in Greater London how vital this help has been in getting them through lockdown.But the only long-term way to save these businesses is for customers to start heading through their doors again.That is why I was one of the first MPs to call for the lockdown to be lted.Now that Prime Minister Boris Johnson has given us the freedom to go back to work and back into town, we need to use it.With so many still working from home, our city centres feel like ghost towns.Jobs are already going or under threat at many familiar big names, from Boots and Burger King to Pret and John Lewis.Taxi drivers, caterers, news vendors, cleaners, millions of livelihoods depend on bustl-ing offices and workplaces filled with people.The situation is very grave. Economists are predicting one of the worst global recessions since records began, with up to .million Brits potentially losing jobs.All the evidence indicates that prosperity is driven by successful cities.If tumbleweed continues to roll through London’s world-class tourist attractions,Manchester’s bars and clubs are half empty,Newcastle’s nightle remains muted, then pulling ourselves out of recession will be far harder.For the sake of all our great cities, we need office workers back at their desks.Of course, it is vital that we behave responsibly and respect social-distancing rules.Huge care has been taken to ensure the process of lting the lockdown is a cautious and gradual one, with some £million being spent to make the high street safe and ready to welcome people back.And I pay tribute to the massive efforts being made by businesses doing everything possible to make their premises Covid-secure to keep their workers and customers safe.I know their reluctance toto public transport. I see that every day as I commute to Westminster on near-empty Tube carriages.But the simple precautions of wearing a face covering and washing your hands thoroughly when you reach your destination can help keep you and others safe.Nothing in le comes without some risk, but the steady fall in Covid cases means that, for the vast majority of us, the risk of catching the virus is getting lower every day.So people should feel confident to go out to their workplace again, and they should also feel happy and secure about grabbing a bite to eat with friends in a cafe.This could be make or break for your city centre.Unless you come to the rescue by spending some money to support these local businesses, they could go under for ever.Saving our city and town centres isn’t just about jobs and the economy.They are the heart of community le.As an example, for many elderly people, popping out to the shops is a hugely important social contact, especiallythey do not have family living nearby.If our town centres become a row of empty shops and boarded-up pubs, that is a heartbreaking loss for our whole community.It would leave all of us more isolated from our neighbours.When the pandemic hit, this country came together in an incredible united effort to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.Now we need to show that same determination when it comes to reviving the economy, saving jobs and supporting businesses in our villages, towns and cities.That means starting up the commute again and getting back to the office.It’s not every day that the Chancellor of the Exchequer says he will knock £ off our lunch bills.But that is what will happen during August.Soyou value your local High Street and want to see it thrive in the future, then head there and eat out to help out.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You are a clever girl, Sue.”It’s a little bit patronising, admittedly and he’d be hauled through every kangaroo court in the country for saying that out loud now.But I’ll take Jim’s innocent version of television before I take ’s joyless, humourless woke wasteland all day long, thanks very much. It’s a happier place.INCIDENTALLY, Loose Women, Janet Street- Porter: “If I was an animal I’d be a terrapin.”What’s technically known as horse-s***.MEANWHILE, on episode three of Celebrity Snoop Dogs, a pug called Colin is snfing around a weight-training room as Channel ’s Kevin McCloud builds to the big reveal.“More eye-catching, though, is that plaque behind the microphone. Could it belong to ­someone who’s good at making people laugh “It’s Russell Kane!” No, it couldn’t.HOW television works .Someone a BBC continuity announcer described as “the wonderful Maxine Peake” starred in last week’s Talking Heads, a fortnight after sharing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory about George Floyd’s death, with The Independent.Miriam Margolyes s to the Beeb shortly, with her Almost Australian travelogue, despite telling Channel ’s Last Leg she wanted the Prime Minister to die of coronavirus.But actor Laurence Fox is unemployable and considered a public pariah, by the industry, because he told Question Time that Britain was “the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe”.One rule for one, quite another for Corbynistas.The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “Asteroid  Audrey is named after which actress ”Marina: “Kim Basinger.”Tenable, Warwick Davis: “Name the ten largest countries in South America.” Devon: “Hungary.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  -year-old Judit Polgar became the youngest ­international grandmaster of which board game ”Helena: “Monopoly.”Ben Shephard: “Mayo is the Spanish word for which month of the year ”Rick: “March.”GOOD Morning Britain, Monday, Piers: “What about this  At my local Italian ­restaurant, on Saturday, after all this showing-each- other-more-kindness talk, there were  no-shows.”Then Piers turned up. Problem solved. So what about it HAVING failed to conquer Hollywood or overthrow international capitalism Russell Brand took on a slightly more manageable project, last week.A cameo in Neighbours where he literally bumped into Toadie, eating a muffin, at the Harold Bishop cafe.“You’re Russell Brand! What are you doing here in Erinsborough ”“Well, you know,” said Brand, “Get Him To The Greek, The Trews, socialism, Ed Miliband. It all went horribly wrong.“So it was either this or a Postcode Lottery advert, with Jeff Brazier.”Actually, he said no such thing.He made a funny, self-mocking speech about the irony of mobile phones being “emblems of interconnectivity, yet we’re more atomised, adrt and lost than ever before”, then went to order a coffee.And I’ve got no hesitation in saying, I think it’s his finest ever work.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has no place anywhere. It is often a breach of human rights. It is often illegal.So it is understandable that many of us are questioning why this is happening – and, by extension, what our role is in this.Has our desire for cheap and cheerful fashion created this sickening practice  Are we somehow to blame for insisting we will only pay as little as possible for everything Should we — as some smarmy “influencers” suggest — be boycotting anyone who sells cheap clothes The simple answer is: NoOf course, in an ideal world, we’d all be buying top quality, ethically sourced garments that last a letime.But that’s just not going to happen. Most people just can’t afford to. And we like to keep up with trends while at the same time paying the bills. There is nothing wrong with that.Our love of fashion keeps the economy going.Fashion is the UK’s largest creative industry. It provides jobs for almost as many people as the financial sector and is one of the most female-dominated industries in the world.Around , people work in the UK fashion industry and approximately  per cent of garment workers are women.Livelihoods are at stakewe decide to boycott fashion brands because of their bad practices.The answer is for fast fashion firms like Boohoo and Quiz to do the work and get their houses in order. This is on them.And big firms like Boohoo — a business worth £.billion — are not without means. They have the resources to make changes.They need to perform due diligence on who is making their clothes — they must forensically examine the whole supply chain, from contractors to sub-contractors and anyone  who has a hand in how this stuff comes to market.Decent wages must be the norm. They must be transparent and tell us, the consumer, what they know.This is not rocket science. It is already happening.The Fashion Transparency Index  ranks  of the biggest global fashion brands according to how much information they provide about their suppliers, supply chain policies and practices and social and environmental impact.Retailers are scored on their transparency across five key areas: Policy and commitments, governance, traceability, supplier assessment and remediation and spotlight issues.HM, one of the largest fashion retailers in the world, is currently top of The Fashion Transparency Index.Stung by allegations that its clothes had been made by child labour in Myanmar — with some paid as little as p an hour — it last year built a new tracking system so consumers can find out where each garment is made.Marks  Spencer also scored highly. It introduced an ethical trading programme including audits of its supply chain in the Nineties.Eleven more brands in the Fashion Index revealed details of their processing facilities — where finishing, dyeing and laundering take place — in  compared to .And ten brands disclosed their raw material suppliers in , compared with just one in .Of course this isn’t just a fast fashion problem. It is industry-wide.What customers need from all brands is transparency, as this leads to accountability and ultimately change.Soyou do want to spend your hard-earned cash on fast fashion, only shop at places where you know they are doing their bit to ensure things are more ethically sourced.AS much as I love new clothes, fast fashion has had its day.Two brands have recently been at the centre of allegations that garments are being made or packed in dire working conditions in Leicester.Boohoo has paid a heavy price for these claims, with more than a billion pounds wiped off the value of its shares.Today, it suffered another big fall after a leading investor sold out on ethical grounds.And rival Quiz was sucked into the growing storm. It has suspended a supplier after claims that a factory in Leicester offered a worker just £ an hour to make its clothes.Quiz admitted that the situation, which it is investigating, is “unacceptable”.As online retailers specialising in casualwear, these companies were riding high after lockdown boosted sales. Following these allegations, the tide is turning against them.It comes after lockdown prompted many of us to reassess our lives, with the desire to be greener high on the agenda.A recent survey showed that more women were willing to make do and mend. That can’t be a bad thing.A common reason that clothes are sent to landfill is a missing button, which is simply appalling.Before buying a new dress or jacket, I now ask myself, ‘Am I going to wear this item for years ’Fashion is a global industry worth more than £trillion a year. It will clean itself up where necessary and adapt.Boohoo and Quiz have been swt to terminate relationships with rogue suppliers. Elsewhere, there is much talk of “respons-ible” and “sustainable” fashion.Don’t be surprisedthe fast fashion pack gives itself a long overdue makeover. Hopefully it will be more than the latest fad.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Scotland’s government has had to be propped up every step of the way by Westminster.Sturgeon is a good TV performer, I’ll give her that.She’s adored by the international media in the same way New Zealand’s Jacinda Ardern is.

Of course, whatever the cost becomes, it is less than the cost of the threat to our national security and is a price we must pay. We were warned repeatedly by all of our allies about involving Huawei in our communications network.In recent years, I have heard first-hand from each of our intelligence-sharing partners in the so-called “Five Eyes” network . All of these countries, our closest allies, have been deeply worried by Britain’s decision. All have warned that this country — and our relationships with our allies — would be compromisedwe allowed Huawei such access. We would have been vulnerable, they warned.Bizarrely, Theresa May ignored this advice, then Boris Johnson’s government originally went further down this terrible road.This, despite the fact that other companies — including US firms — could have provided just the same technology, without the same security risks.And, key sources tell me, all for the same price. Still the Government snubbed our allies, alarmed our friends, and stuck to their decision.Privately it was briefed out that our own security services were confident of their ability to get backdoor access to see what Huawei would be doing and to control any covert activity. But all of this seemed a ridiculously high-risk venture. And for what exactly  Fortunately, that bizarre decision got reversed yesterday.Several factors have contributed to it. The first is an obvious change in relations towards China that is going on around the world. Covid- has played a part. China — unwittingly or carelessly — gave the world a virus which has all but halted our economies.The CCP’s lies and cover-ups during this devastating period have meant that all of us have been confined to our houses for months — and not just those who have contracted the coronavirus that came from Wuhan.In the months and years ahead, all of us will be poorer because of the CCP’s lies. The state has disappeared its own scientists. It allowed travel even after it knew what it was dealing with. It lied about the nature of the virus.And other members of the Five Eyes network have suggested that the evidence points clearly to the virus having been created in a Chinese laboratory.President Trump and his Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, have rightly made an issue of this. Both have been warning for years about the instability of China as a partner. As recent events in Hong Kong should remind us, China is a one-party, totalitarian state. It rules by dictatorship and terror. Of course, it is also highly technologically skilled and financially ever more dominant.The CCP seeks to make China the world’s leading power. Washington is — rightly — determined to stop that. And this country —we value freedom and the rule of law, as we always have — should seek to stop that too.This means, among much , denying China and Chinese state companies from extending their grip in countries like ours.For years, Chinese companies have stolen information, ripped off s, and otherwise acted completely unlawfully. They have engaged in espionage and information theft on an industrial scale.Some people might look at yesterday’s decision and think it a small, technical matter. It isn’t.Not only is it a decision with far-reaching consequences for this country’s security. It is also a signal of which side this country will be on in one of the most important tussles of our day.Everywhere China seeks to extend its power is an area where freedom recedes.Yesterday was a bad day for Huawei, a good day for Britain and a great day for freedom.Q: WHAT is the new ruling on Huawei A: From the end of this year, telecoms firms will not be able to buy any new Huawei hardware, such as antennas, to put into their G networks. By the end of , all Huawei equipment must be stripped out of the UK’s G networks.Q: Why is G important A: It will be ten times faster than G and allow more complicated technology, such as driverless cars, to operate.Q: What is Huawei currently used for A: The firm is the leading provider of technology needed to operate wireless networks that provide the G signal on our mobile phones. They were going to be used for “non-core” equipment in the G network. Instead European firms Nokia or Erion are likely to provide the hardware.Q: Can I still use my Huawei mobile phone A: Yes. There is no plan to ban its handsets.Q: Will the ban affect my phone signal A: Some telecom firms have warned that stripping out all Huawei hardware too quickly could result in a temporary loss of signal in some places, but other experts say this concern has been exaggerated.Q: Does this affect full fibre broadband connections A: Not at the moment. The Government’s security advisers have only recommended “transitioning away” from Huawei when it comes to fibre networks.Q: Will I have to replace a Huawei router in my home A: The router is not part of the G infrastructure and won’t be affected.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was previously thought that the value had only just reached  at the end of May.This allowed for some restrictions to be eased on June  when some school years ed, outdoor markets reopened and people were allowed to meet up outdoors in groups of six - with social distancing rules in place.R, or R nought, refers to the average number of people that one infected person can expect to pass the coronavirus on to.Scientists use it to predict how far and how fast a disease will spread - and the number can also inform policy decisions about how to contain an outbreak.For example,a virus has an R of three, it means that every sick person will pass the disease on to three other peopleno containment measures are introduced.Its also worth pointing out that the R is a measure of how infectious a disease is, but not how deadly.The latest Government statistics published last week show that the R value is currently between . and  for England, with some regional iations.It is above  in the South West at between . to ., while the South East is in the range of . to ..East Anglia and the North West have also seen similar increases in their R value ranges - from . to . in the previous week to . to .However, the value is down slightly in the Midlands - despite a local outbreak and subsequent lockdown in Leicester - to between . and ..  The figures were published a week after pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers were allowed to reopen.The modelling, by a sub-group of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies , use data such as contacts, hospital admissions, ICU admissions and deaths.It generally takes - weeks for changes in R to be reflected due to the time between infection and needing hospital care.For the new study, published today, researchers tested more than , volunteers aged over five across the country for Covid-.About  per cent of those who tested positive reported no symptoms on the day of the test or the previous week, though they may have developed symptoms later.The report provides an insight into who was infected with the virus between May  and June , comparing geography, age, sex, ethnicity, key worker status and symptoms.Beyond the diminished rate of infection, the research found young adults aged  to  were more likely to test positive than other age groups.People of Asian ethnicity were also more likely to test positive than those of white ethnicity, while people working in care homes were at greater risk of being infected during lockdown than the general population.The report also showed anyone who had recent contact with a known Covid- case was  times more likely to test positive than those with no such contact, emphasising the importance of contact tracing in keeping the spread of the virus under control.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the study is crucial to the countrys ongoing battle with coronavirus.This ambitious testing programme will help us better understand the spread of the virus to date, predict how it may spread in the future and inform our response to the pandemic, he said.It shows the impact our national lockdown efforts have had and demonstrates that we have taken the right actions at the right time.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.As a country we have made great strides towards beating this virus but we mustnt take our foot off the pedal, and such studies will be vital as we continue to fight this virus.The study, which has been upscaled and repeated for June, will now undergo peer review before a final report is published.Plans are currently underway for a second large-scale study, which will use antibody tests to determine how much of the general public has been infected with Covid- in the past.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Joey Syer, Co-founder of MyArtBroker - which has more than  years of experience of art dealing and specialises in Banksys work - believes it could have been worth millions.He told the Sun Online: Its a huge shame and opportunity lost for Londoners that the latest Banksy work has already been removed by the anti-graffiti teams at TFL. Of course, we understand why, and we understand its highly likely whoever removed it was following procedure and had no idea they were destroying a Banksy. Had TFL management known, and had the opportunity to remove and protect the installation we estimate its value as a complete package to be in the region of £.million.Sadiq Khan must be kicking himself, but Banksy has yet again proved his ability to entertain and make a statement with such daring and style.A Transport for London source told the Evening Standard the cleaners had no idea of the signicance of the work, saying: “When we saw the video, we started to look into it and spoke to the cleaners. It started to emerge that they had noticed some sort of ‘rat thing’ a few days ago and cleaned it off, as they should.It comes after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan handed over control of the capitals transport system in a row over cash.The Government gave him a £.bn bailout last month to keep the network afloat after the mayor insisted it was cash-strapped.A TfL spokesperson said: “We appreciate the sentiment of encouraging people to wear face coverings, which the vast majority of customers on our transport network are doing. In this particular case, the work was removed some days ago due to our strict anti-graffiti policy. We’d like to offer Banksy the chance to do a new version of his message for our customers in a suitable location.”They added when graffiti is spotted, the train is pulled out of service and into a depot where cleaners will go on and wipe it off before the train goes back into use, usually on the same day.In a video shared to the artists Instagram, the anonymous graffiti genius is seen entering a carriage in a hazmat suit, face mask and goggles. Its suggested Banksy had disguised himself as one of TFLs deep-cleaners.As commuters look on he paints stencils on train walls and windows and is also filmed getting on and off at ious stops.The message of the masterpieces - a rat spraying gunk and snot across a carriage, another rat frolicking inside a discarded surgical mask and another using PPE as a parachute - is to wear a mask.The artist captioned the post: If you dont mask you dont get.Brits were told by the Government they would need to wear face coverings on public transport back in June, and new measures have since been introduced to enforce the wearing of face coverings in shops in a few weeks time.In the footage, commuters try not to stare as he sprays a tag on the back wall of a Tube carriage, dripping in what looks like infectious-looking slime.Other commuters rush past the street art legend as he heads up the stairs to the next  - his paints cleverly disguised as disinfectant spray gear at his side.The video ends with a shot of the slogan I get lockdown sprayed on a wall at - from the sound of the announcements - Euston Square Station.

The Duchess of Sussex is also thought to have held her bridal bash there ahead of her wedding to Harry, , at Windsor Castle in May . The Oxfordshire lodge currently has a temporary campsite but has now got the go-ahead to allow guests to sleep under the stars in fancy bell tents on a permanent basis. Over the years, residents in the quaint village of Great Tew have become increasingly fed up with Soho Farmhouse’s expansion - especially about the increase in traffic and spike in road accidents. In the planning application for the luxury campsite, local Claire Berry expressed her outrage at all the ‘vegans’ visiting the club.She said they are ruining farmland by turning it into a ‘Disneyland’, which is inappropriate during the coronavirus pandemic. Claire wrote: “At a time when we need all our farmland, why is this land being changed  “I surmise that the customers of this campsite identy themselves as vegan vegetarian andwe are to feed the population that identies in this way we will need more farmland. “Therefore it would be something that these very customers will be against. “There is also the increase in traffic which is becoming a serious problem especially on Friday and Monday. “Looking at the figures in the PFA Consulting document of March , the numbers of cars on Friday th Oct  in Tracey Lane was , so will this change of use mean more customers and more cars ”Claire added: “Here we are in the middle of the Covid- pandemic which is nature biting back. It is a time when we should consider seriously how we go forward. “A campsite where customers are encouraged to drive  miles for a meal and an overnight is beginning to seem out of step with a world where the climate is falling apart due to pollution and now with a virus that is so dangerous. “Maybe now is the time for all of us to rethink and allowing much needed farmland to be converted to the equivalent of Disneyland is something that should be reconsidered.”The football pitch, which Soho Farmhouse wants to move, may appeal to former footie ace David Beckham, whose converted barn is just down the road. The application states it needs to be relocated due to complaints from guests, saying: “An operational review of feedback from members and hotel guests revealed that the five-a-side football pitch was the subject of numerous complaints from people relaxing by the swimming pool and sun lawns who felt the two activities were not compatible.“As a consequence of this review, a decision was made to explore other potential locations for the five-a-side football pitch. “The unused piece of land adjacent to Farm Camp lent itself perfectly to the proposed use, both in terms of its size and its location close to the changing and shower facilities in the gym.”The campsite will appeal to the rich and famous looking for a coronavirus-friendly getaway.Tents will be spaced so guests can socially distance and enjoy the fresh air - where experts say the virus is less likely to spread. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A fth of the nations most vulnerable people in care home have been infected by the deadly virus. There are also questions surrounding the Government decision to go into lockdown weeks later than many other European countries.

MPs have launched their own inquiry earlier this week with an All-Party Parliamentary Group, led by Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran. Ms Moran said earlier this week: From the neglect of care homes to the lack of an effective testing regime, each day brings more evidence of mistakes in the handling of this pandemic – and there is every indication that we will see a potential second spike this winter.“The country and the NHS cannot afford for these errors to be repeated.

But the Department for Work of Pensionsis now doubling its work coaches from , to , to deal with the pandemic in an £m boost. While , due by October can fit into existing centres, the other , - due by March  - will need “new estate”, chief Neil Couling confirmed. Askedthe new work coaches would work in an office, or from home, the Universal Credit Director-General put the emphasis on offices.  He told MPs on the Work and Pensions Committee: “The first , [work coaches] we can fit into our existing estate and properties. We’ve been carefully checking that’s all Covid-compliant, working with our local trade unions on all of that. But after that, we’re going to need new estate. So we’re currently in discussions about acquiring that to a rapid timetable. He said reopening shuttered job centres was “a possibility” and at least one is being examined now, “but in general I think these will be newer properties.” Mr Couling made the admission to SNP MP Chris Stephens - who fought the closure of half of Glasgow’s Jobcentres two years ago. He said: “This decision was always going to impact on services especially during an economic downturn, when unemployment rises. Today’s extraordinary admission demonstrates that the decision to close job centres was wrong then and wrong now.PCS union general secretary Mark Serwotka said: “This is a startling admission that clearly shows closing job centres in  was a mistake. “Calamitous ministers are on one hand saying we rightly need more staff but don’t have the space to accommodate them in the current jobcentre estate.” He called for an end to benefit sanctions saying “there clearly will be a major jobs shortage.” It came as MPs and a minister rowed over the five-week wait for the first payment of Universal Credit. Campaigners say despite people being able to get an advance payment, many are turning to food banks and struggling to get by. The National Audit Office last week said the standard wait for first payment “can exacerbate claimants’ debt and financial dficulties”, with many organisations saying it causes “hardship”.

Appearing at Parliamentaposs Work and Pensions Committee today, Will Quince was told research showed people on the combined benefit were % more likely to be in rent arrears than people on old-style Housing Benefit. The research was from Citizens Advice, which helps run the Help to Claim service, chair Stephen Timms said. Mr Quince said he would need to see evidence for that, not just anecdotally but some actual data.He added: The evidence we have is that itaposs people coming on to Universal Credit with historic rent arrears which actually get paid off faster over time on Universal Credit, he said.There is not evidence to suggest, as far as Iaposve seen ... that suggests that people are building up rent arrears while on Universal Credit. Labour MP Stephen Timms, who chairs the committee, noted a National Audit Office report which suggested, in fact, that arrears tend to increase when people are moved on to Universal Credit - and this was exacerbated by the five-week wait for the first payment.The NAO report last week declared the standard wait for first payment “can exacerbate claimants’ debt and financial dficulties” - despite people being able to take out an advance.Yet Mr Quince replied people donapost have to wait for a first payment because they can get an advance, which is paid back out of peopleaposs benefits over  months. He added the standard allowance in Universal Credit has been increased by £ a week in   due to the pandemic. Mr Quince insisted the five-week wait was fundamental to the Universal Credit system. Anyone axing it would have to “start again” with a new benefit regime, he claimed, suggesting it could be reduced by a few daysBACS bank payments are reformed - but no further. And UC director-general Neil Couling warned replacing advance payments with a grant could become a “honeypot for foreign criminals”. But Mr Quince became embroiled in a furious row after he blamed “scaremongering” for people not getting their money quick enough. He said: “Some of the scaremongering around Universal Credit does put people off. “Some of the scaremongering doesn’t help and it puts people off checking their eligibility and applying for Universal Credit at the point they become eligible.“If they leave it far too late until the point at which they’re in crisis, even an advance payment or a grant… wouldn’t actually cut it.” Labour MP Neil Coyle hit back: “He suggests some people are ‘scaremongering’ for presenting the facts about Universal Credit. “When people present facts of real people’s lives, people forced into prostitution and made homeless as a result of Universal Credit, it makes him look beyond pompous.” The minister snapped: “I’ve been called many things - pompous isn’t one of them, so there’s a first. “In sharing facts comes responsibility to share context. “Context is important, and the reality as we know… is people are delaying their claims.

Shyieme Lynvest was kned and Raseante Spencer-Hamilton was left with a slash wound which cut down to the bone as the violence erupted between two rival gangs in Solihull. CCTV caught the moment violence erupted when the groups bumped into each other at at Resort World, on September  last year. Samba Faal and Christ Lidiu were in the sports store when Lynvest, Spencer-Hamilton and Damel Lebert walked in to the Nike shop. The three backed off as Faal and Lidiu confronted them in the doorway, where Lynvest hints he is hiding a kne beneath his clothing. The confrontation then spills outside, with Faal falling to the floor as heaposs punched unconscious before Hamilton and Lebert jump on him. CCTV shows Lidiu lash out with a kne at Hamilton, leaving him with a cm slash wound to his arm which cut down to the bone. Lynvest is then stabbed in the back during the violence by Lidiu.  The men flee, with Lynvest caught on camera dropping his kne in an outside drain. After a major investigation by the Birmingham Organised Crime  Gangs Team, the five were identied from CCTV and were charged with violent disorder following the trouble. West Midlands Police released the shocking CCTV as all five were jailed at Birmingham Crown Court.Chief Inspector Phil Cape said: “This was a really violent incident in a shopping centre, while families are seen on CCTV clearly trying to enjoy a day out. I’d like to thank the members of the public who came forward to help with the investigation, and the officers who quickly recovered this footage. “Yet again, we have young men who are now spending time behind bars because they thought it was acceptable to carry a kne. It never is. “We’ll continue to arrest people and disrupt gang activity in Birmingham, while working with other organisations to help young people at risk of falling into that lestyle.

Libby now lives with her new owner in Somerset after escaping from the infamous Macau Canidrome where dogs were killed every day while being kept in appalling conditions. The now happy and well-fed dog was one of the many thousands of greyhounds forced to run at Asiaaposs last remaining racetrack that became infamous for its dire mistreatment of animals. The unfortunate greyhounds and lurchers that ended up there endured a le of abuse, neglect, exploitation and injury before being put down, often at a young age. Libby is one of the few dogs to have left the stadium - where gamblers staked their money on the misery of animals - alive. During the time it was in operation, it is estimated that , dogs died at the canidrome and records show that an animal was put down every day. Like the other dogs living there, Libby slept on the hard floor of its cramped kennel with no bedding and rarely -ever - ventured outside of its concrete confines. Libby never experienced walks or grass under her feet and was given minimal medical care by her callous owners. Without a pet adoption programme, many of the dogs there would simply be euthanisedthey ever became sick or unable to race.  Records show Libby ended up in the canidrome as a puppy after being sold by cruel dog breeders in Australia, following the fate of many before her. Betting is big business in Macau, a Special Administrative Region within China, known for its giant casinos and reputation as the worldaposs biggest gambling hub. First opened in , the cityaposs canidrome was supplied with hundreds of greyhounds every year, many of which would come from Australia and beyond.  As its profile grew, demands for its closure by animal rights activists grew louder as they pressured Australiaaposs government and racing bodies to block the exports of greyhounds to the territory. As the supply eventually dwindled unscrupulous owners in Ireland and in the UK stepped in to fill the void, readily selling young greyhounds to agents in Hong Kong. After years of dwindling interest from locals and pressure from authorities the stadium shut its doors for good in . But the closure left  canines without a home and an international effort was launched to house them.Libby was one of five dogs that the Forever Hounds Trust rescued from the Macau racetrack where  dogs have now been successfully adopted.Their condition was described as being in a very poor state and it took at least three months for them to learn to become pets and not just a racing commodity. Her new owner Saz, says that when Libby first arrived in her new home in Wellington, near Taunton, she was slow to adapt to her new le of comforts.Libby didn’t know how to go up and down stairs or get on the sofa at first, but soon learned how comfortable it was to sleep on her own bed in a video that since went viral on Facebook. She said: “It breaks my heart to think of Libby in the Canidrome, and what could have happened to heranimal welfare group ANIMA and Forever Hounds Trust hadn’t been there to help her. “But when you see her now you cannot believe she has spent all her le in the Canidrome. She loves to play and chases tennis balls and she has learnt how much fun it can be to go out for a walk.

Brits who were part of the data set either tested positive for Covid- or were heavily suspected of having the virus. Nine per cent of those infected also suffered from skin rashes and eight per cent of people with other tell-tale symptoms also had the skin problem.  Fever, continuous cough and loss of smell or taste are the only three symptoms officially recognised by the NHS. Anyone with any one of the three are told to get tested and self isolate. Data was taken from the Kings College Covid Symptom Tracker app, which has more than , users. Lead researcher Dr Mario Falchi said Covid- patients reported suffering from the rashes for weeks - which is much longer than the three NHS symptoms. Writing in the study, Dr Falchi said: aposCovid- rashes may present in many forms and at dferent stages of the disease. Although, it is less prevalent than fever, it is more specic of Covid- and last longer. An increased awareness from the public and healthcare professionals regarding Covid- skin changes will allow more efficient identication of new and earlier clusters of the disease. Professor Tim Spector, an epidemiologist at Kings College, told MailOnline last month that Britain was missing aposthe majority of casesapos because it was aposout of line with the rest of the worldapos.

Jordana Davidson - then just  - was locked up for two-and-a-half years in  and was described as controlling and obsessive. The woman was  or  when she began a sexual relationship with her first victim, reports the Liverpool Echo. When she was , the conniving predator then had sex with a -year-old girl, having also misled this child about her gender. Davidson was released from prison on May  last year and moved to Liverpool, where she was befriended by an adult woman. But the woman - who didnapost know about Davidsonaposs sinister past - introduced the pervert, then , to her -year-old daughter. Liverpool Crown Court heard Davidson is subject to an indefinite Sexual Harm Prevention Order , which bans her from any contact with children under the age of , except for contact that is inadvertent or with the informed consent of the childaposs parent or . Michael Stephenson, prosecuting, said the mum - an ex-con - took the defendant under her wing after a fashion because she was being bullied. He said: She said she had no awareness of the nature of the defendantaposs convictions. She thought that she had been sentenced for either drugs or some sort of violence and thought she was a fairly harmless kid, because of her youthful appearance. The mum said Davidson met with her daughter about  times between May  and June , but suspected they also met in private. Davidson later confessed to police that she and the child twice met alone, but insisted there was no physical activity between them. On June , the woman was walking down the street, ahead of Davidson and her daughter, when she heard them arguing. Mr Stephenson said: She heard her daughter saying to the defendant aposI could get you killedapos and she then told her mother aposthis soft c*** said she is in love with meapos. The defendant was crying and said she was sorry. The police were contacted and Davidson was recalled on licence to prison. Officers examined her mobile phone and found she and the girl exchanged  text messages and  phone calls in little over a week. Mr Stephenson said the girl refused to give an interview to police and expressed the view Davidson had done nothing wrong at one stage. When interviewed in November, Davidson admitted having a romantic attachment to the child, and said she considered her a girlfriend. She claimed the girlaposs mum was aware of their developing relationship, but the woman denied this. Davidson, now , of no fixed address but formerly of Rhyl, North Wales, admitted breaching her SHPO. Her previous convictions are for five counts of sexual activity with a child in February . Thomas Sherrington, defending, conceded there had been a risk of his client forming a physical relationship with the girl. He said: What this appears to be is a rather warped sense of the reality of the seriousness of the situation the defendant found herself in, an inappropriate in fact relationship, with a child. The lawyer said Davidson was remorseful and wanted to express her sorrow and guilt. He said: She says how foolish she acted considering she had been released from prison some  days prior and was well aware of the terms of the order, but her feelings got the better of her. She has said to me today she feels like she will be able to get the help and assistance she needs in order to combat this behaviour now she has ed to custody. Mr Sherrington added: She tells me she has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and emotional distress disorder. She is currently on medication in prison for these mental health disorders and suspects there may be some correlation between that and her offending.

His distressed friends desperately alerted Facebook to what was happening, but the live-stream continued as personal trainer Mr Bailey died by suicide in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.Mental health campaigner Craig Spillane, who found Mr Baileyaposs body after breaking down the door of his flat, told StokeonTrentLive he called  five times over the course of a week in a bid to get his friend help.Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror.  He said it was the third time dad-of-four Mr Bailey, a former boxer and community worker, had made an attempt on his own le in the space of a few days. Mr Spillane, a -year-old electrician who now helps others after struggling with suicidal thoughts, decided to speak out to raise awareness of how mental health services allegedly let Mr Bailey down. Friends pleaded with Mr Bailey to not give up and stay strong after he said he would take his own le. One wrote we are all here for you. It is thought up to  people were watching some of his last moments.  Mr Spillane, who runs the Men Unite group, said: I was at home when my girlfriendaposs daughter shouted to me to say that Baz was on Facebook threatening to kill himself. I called  and got in my car straight away. When I arrived I saw the police van had parked up. I shouted to the officers to askthey were looking for Bazaposs flat as they were in the wrong place. I then sprinted up the stairs. I tried his door but the chain was still on. I smashed my way in and thataposs when I saw him. I was screaming for help. We started CPR and at one point we had a faint pulse but it was too late. I just held him in my arms. There were eight police officers in the flat and then the paramedics arrived. Mr Bailey was pronounced dead at the scene. Mr Spillane added: Baz called me on the Monday on his th birthday and thanked me for setting up Men Unite and told me then that he was done.  As soon as I was off the phone I called  and got the police and ambulance out because he had taken an overdose. He was out in his van at the time. Then on the Wednesday he made another attempt on his le. Then on the Friday our friend Stefan Hanks rang to say he had Baz in the car. I rang  saying he needed to be sectioned. They just fobbed me off.  I told Stefan to take him to Harplands car park. He was then taken to AE but he left. It was actually the security guard who rang Stefan. Stefan and another friend then found Baz wandering around the car park. They got him in the car and bought him a KFC and as far as we were aware we thought heaposd be OK. They got him home and left him to sleep. The next day I tried to call Baz but I didnapost get any response and a short time later the live stream started. He had battled his demons for a long time. He just couldnapost beat them on his own. A week before he died, Mr Bailey put up a Facebook post with a broken heart emoji, writing: Moral of the story. Donapost give your heart to anyone. They will break it it. Hours earlier, he wrote: Liars and cheats always try and turn things round and worm their way out of it. Definitely staying on my own from now on.  The next day, his birthday, he wrote: Iaposm done. It came just days after he mourned the loss of a friend, writing still canapost believe youaposre gone brother. Mr Spillane described his close friend as one-of-a-kind. Mr Bailey had founded the Ultimate Fitness Centre in Chesterton and in recent years campaigned to rid the streets of the psychoactive drug monkey dust, which his son had struggled with.  Mr Spillane said: He would go out of his way and bend over backwards to help others. We knew how much he was struggling. Itaposs such a tragic loss of a brilliant man. North Staffordshire Combined Healthcare NHS Trust - which runs Harplands - said it has launched an investigation. A spokesman said: As one of a number of providers of mental health and substance misuse services and support across Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire, we are acutely aware of the risks and issues facing us all at this unique time.  In line with our normal legal responsibilities, we are sure people will understand that we cannot comment on inidual cases or specic events until a full investigation has taken place and the full facts established. We can confirm that all the necessary processes are now underway and our thoughts and condolences are with the family.

We all have an ethical and moral responsibility to do everything we can to approach this dficult issue responsibly and without causing unnecessary further distress or potential harm to our local communities and vulnerable people.” Facebook has said it had provided fitness fan Baz with support resources following his initial post on Saturday afternoon. The live-stream was later deleted. A Facebook spokesman said: “Our thoughts go out to Mr Bailey’s family at this dficult time. We can confirm that the live-stream was deleted very soon after being posted and a further post has also now been removed at the family’s request.

The popular online brand has confirmed  workers at the site have tested positive for the virus.The warehouse previously described as a breeding ground for Covid-  has been investigated after employees caught the illness, reports Examiner Live. Clipper logistics operates the depot at the site in South Yorkshire. It comes after a wave of outbreaks were linked to meat processing plants, and concerns have been raised over conditions at the UKaposs garment factories too.

Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates Sheffield MP Clive Betts said a public health investigation into the Pretty Little Thing warehouse began about a month ago after it was found the virus had been transmitted into the community rather than in the workplace. He added it emerged most of those who contracted the illness lived together and shared lts to work. The MP claimed he had been contacted by around  workers during the pandemic who are concerned about coronavirus precautions in place at the warehouse.It had also been reported that workers were finding it impossible to maintain safe social distancing principles as they worked alongside their colleagues. One worker told the BBC that the aisles in the warehouse are ft foot wide, with up to  people working in them at any one time.  Workers have also complained of a shortage of hand sanitiser.One of them told the  BBC : Going to work has the chance of killing me and infecting my grandson. To save lives, shut the place.A spokesman for Pretty Little Thing said: Since the onset of the pandemic Clipper logistics, who operate the warehouse in Sheffield have been closely following and adhering to all the guidance provided by the Government. To operate safely, they have fundamentally changed how they operate the warehouse to accommodate all the necessary social distancing, hygiene and self-isolation rules to eliminate risk and to keep everyone safe. They have ensured that they have kept local officials and the Environmental Health updated and offered an open invitation for them to visit  whenever they wanted to inspect, to speak to employees and to offer any advice on any additional measures that they could be taking, because the absolute priority is to protect the wellbeing of everyone in the Clipper team.

The statement mask provides absolutely no coverage over the mouth or nose, leading many to criticise the design. Among those to question the product was Twitter user Imogen Jayde from Shrewsbury, Shropshire. She posted a photo of the face mask saying: Think PLT missed the point. Her tweet, which has been liked more than , times, prompted many others to slam the item. Maddy Heritage from Tamworth, Staffordshire wrote: Face mask but make it useless. Emma Pharoah from Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, retweeted the image saying: PLT are really f* up atm arenapost they  One user named Eden Loise fumed: Companies who see masks as a trend rather than a necessity in helping prevent thousands of people dying. What is this @OfficialPLT, wise up. And another user from Glasgow named Rebekah dubbed it: The most useless thing Iaposve ever seen.Pretty Little Thing advertised the glam mask as a statement item, and does not appear to state anywhere on their website that it is to be used for personal protective purposes. The face mask seems to have now been removed from the website but a similar, multicolour version remains listed, but is out of stock.

The couple were  miles apart on July , , when they received the paperwork, and they spent the day very dferently. Diana was in London, where she had lunch with members of the English National Ballet before being photographed by the press. Meanwhile her soon-to-be ex-husband was with their sons Princes William and Harry at the Royal Familyaposs Scottish estate Balmoral. Diana, who wasnapost exactly short of cash as she was from a wealthy family, walked away from the orce a very, very rich woman with Charlesaposs former personal financial adviser saying she took him to the cleaners. She is believed to have received a lump sum of £.million as well as an allowance to run her private office, which looked after her charity work and royal duties. She was also allowed to keep living in her apartment in Kensington Palace. Geoffrey Bignell, who looked after the heir to the throneaposs finances for  years, told theat the time: Princess Diana took every penny he had.  I was told to liquidate everything, all his investments, so that he could give her the cash. He was very unhappy about that. Thataposs when I stopped being his personal financial adviser because he had no personal wealth left. She took him to the cleaners. Anthony Julius, the solicitor who represented Diana, urged the princess to give up her HRH title in a bid to get more money. She did this, but later regretted the decision.  According to Mr Bignell, many of Charlesaposs friends thought the figure was excessive. However there was one thing Charles drew the line at and said he refused to keep paying - her bills From September ,  of Dianaaposs favourite stores were instructed to start sending their invoices and tabs straight to the Princessapos home rather than Charles. The legal letter read: With effect from  September , any expenditure incurred by or on behalf of Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales on or after that date should be invoiced directly to the Princess of Walesaposs Office, Apartment , Kensington Palace, London.  The couple have been separated for three years before the finally made their split official.The final decision came in the form of a handwritten letter from the Queen, which was delivered Diana via royal messenger just weeks after she gave her tell-all interview about the breakdown of her marriage. The one-to-one with Martin Bashir, broadcast in November , saw Diana sensationally reveal there were “three of us” in her marriage to Charles, in reference to his long-term love Camilla.Watched by .million viewers, she also described the prince’s camp as the “enemy” and said the monarchy was in desperate need of modernisation - causing huge embarrassment for the Royal Family.  And the tone of the Queenaposs letter left Diana in no doubt about her profound annoyance with the interview, which suddenly plunged the monarchy into crisis as the public sided with her. The Queen wrote: “I have consulted with the Archbishop of Canterbury and with the prime minister and, of course, with Charles, and we have decided that the best course for you is orce. Even though the couple had already been apart for three years, they hadnapost technically orced. Diana had already insisted she didnapost want a orce, and told Bashir of her “deep, profound sadness” about their separation and that she only needed “clarity on a situation that has been of enormous discussion.

It is the first time that the monarch - who has been isolating since the start of the lockdown - has made a public engagement since March . She was seen in public for the first time since lockdown on June  when she attended a stripped back Trooping the Colour. Captain Tom, who turned  in April, raised nearly £million for health service charities by walking laps of his Bedfordshire garden. He will travel with members of his family for the rare, special investiture with the monarch. Royal investitures were put on hold during the pandemic, and those scheduled to take place at Buckingham Palace and the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh in June and July were postponed. But the -year-old Queen, who has been staying at Windsor since before lockdown for her safety, will carry out the official engagement in person - rare for the monarch during the pandemic - to honour Captain Tom. It is her first public appearance since Commonwealth Day, when she stood alongside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in one of the coupleaposs last frontline royal engagements. The monarch will use the sword that belonged to her father, George VI, and will present him with the insignia of Knight Bachelor.  The ceremony will take place entirely within the confines of Windsor Castle, with no viewing positions for the public. Members of the public are being asked not to attend Windsor town centre or gather in the hope of seeing any of the ceremony, which will not be visible from any external viewpoint. Captain Tom had set out to raise £,, but his incredible gesture won him fans around the world and saw his fundraising efforts soar. In honour of his incredible achievement, he was given a flypast on his th birthday.  Captain Tom also became the oldest person to ever score a UK Number One single with his rendition of Youaposll Never Walk Alone, recorded with Michael Ball and the NHS Voices Of Care Choir. And his incredible efforts saw him awarded a special Pride Of Britain award. Captain Tom said the response to his charitable efforts had been outstanding. He said: Itaposs hard to describe thereaposs been so much kindness shown and so many people making kind remarks.

Today a health boss warned that a rising tide has been found in areas with a high number of terraced houses where multiple people live. The outbreak in Blackburn with Darwen is centred on the areaaposs Asian community, Professor Dominic Harrison, the local authorityaposs director of public health, said. He warned that the area could follow Leicester back into lockdown in just two weeksthis trend is not reversed.It is one of  areas named as being at risk of a fresh outbreak.The Lancashire town brought in extra restrictions yesterday, banning large groups from visiting each other and instructing people not to shake hands. Prof Harrison, speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, said: We have what we call a rising tide event rather than an outbreak, and by that we mean that weaposve got a number of cases rising in specic areas across a signicant community, but not a single big outbreak like Kirklees or other areas that had a workplace outbreak.  It can have the same effect because it can drive up the cases, but what we are seeing from looking at the postcode data of those cases is, in the last couple of weeks, is that what we are seeing is a single case being infected, then going back to a household and all that household becoming infected. And when we look at the data what we can see is clusters in a part of the town, but the clusters are household clusters, so a number of those are causing the rising tide event and we know that they are in mainly south-Asian areas, and they are in areas with high number of terraced houses with high numbers of occupants in the house, so four or more, five or more people in the household. He said the Blackburn with Darwen borough, which has an Asian population of about %, had  cases in the last two weeks and  of those cases are south Asian.  The rate of confirmed cases per , has gone up to  per ,, up from . cases in the seven days to July . The authority is third on the list of highest weekly rates, behind Leicester, which has a rate of . cases per , and is subject to a local lockdown, and nearby Pendle, with a rate of .. Prof Harrison said this has triggered the local response, with the establishment of an outbreak control management board and five extra measures introduced. These are: A limit of two people from the same household allowed to visit another household.  At the moment national guidance allows two families to meet indoors as long as they keep to social distancing guidance. The council are asking residents to limit the numbers of people meeting indoors to people who live in the house plus only two members from a second household at any one time. Wearing cloth face coverings in all enclosed public spaces.  All residents will be strongly recommended to wear a cloth face coveringin all enclosed public spaces. This means in all shops, workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres, hair and beauty salons etc. Greeting and embracing.  Rather than give handshakes or a hug, the council are asking people to only bump elbows with anyone outside of their immediate family. Support for small shops.  The council are stepping up our Public Protection advice and support to small shops across the borough to ensure that measures such as wearing face coverings, social distancing, good hygiene practice and increased ventilation are being followed to help reduce the risk of virus spread in these businesses. Testing.  The council are doing more targeted testing this week, with the arrival of a mobile testing unit at Witton Park Academy in addition to the testing facility at Royal Blackburn Hospital.

According to St Swithinaposs Day legend, the whim of the spirit of an angry medieval saint will determine the weather through the end of July and August. Although the quirky tradition has never been proven true - staycation holidaymakers better hope itaposs a myth. Todayaposs widespread grey, drab conditions throughout much of the UK have all the makings of a traditional British summer. So sun-seekers may find more hope proper scientic weather forecasts of C highs this weekend prove a more reliable bellwether for the summer to come. The forecasting legend is said to have begun when a ninth-century Anglo-Saxon bishop of Winchesteraposs grave was disturbed. The bishop, whose name is styled Swithin or Swithun, was believed to have been a tutor to a young King Alfred the Great. He is said to have requested to be buried outside Winchester Cathedral so his grave would be exposed to the elements and the footsteps of worshippers. But in the tenth century priests are said to have moved the bishopaposs tomb, and a terrible storm struck.  The great squall was said to be a sign of the bishopaposs displeasure, and the eccentric legend was born. The proverb goes: “St Swithin’s Daythou dost rain, for forty days it will remain, St Swithin’s Daythou be fair, for forty days will rain na mair.The Met Office revealed what the forecast had in store today as St Swithinaposs special day rolls around once again.Meteorologist Alex Burkill said: For many itaposs going to be a largely cloudy day.  There will be a rain that could be a bit heavy at times, particularly across parts of Scotland and then western areas of the UK - so north-west England, Wales, south-west England. So cloudy with outbreaks of rain that will be heavier towards the north, and further east the clouds could be thick enough for a few spots of rain but mostly dry. AskedBrits can expect  days of rain, Mr Burkill said: I think in the history of anything that has never happened, and thataposs not going to happen this time, fortunately.  While the gloomy picture will remain into Thursday, by the end of the week the UK could be in for much warmer temperatures and sunny skies, especially in the south. Mr Burkill added: Itaposs a drier and brighter picture as we go into the start of August - it does look like weaposre going to see more prolonged dry spells than really weaposve had this month. So quite a dferent story from what many of us can expect on quite a cloudy and damp St Swithinaposs Day.  St Swithinaposs Day has certainly never been a particularly reliable source of meteorological predictions. In , July  was hit by a -hour rainstorm, but  days of sunshine came after. In ,  and a half hours of glorious sunshine were followed by  days of rain out of the next .BBC Weatheraposs Matt Taylor also mentioned the legend, the Express reports - and assured Brits not to take the folklore seriously as sunshine is forecast in a matter of just days. He told viewers: If legend stands true,it rains today with you itaposs going to for the next  days butit stays dry it will do for the rest of summer. The good news for us is the legend doesnapost seem to be true, the most weaposve ever seen in modern day records is  days of rain. You certainly donapost want that to be the case today as for some of you it is going to be a bit of a cloudy and damp day. If youaposve got some cloud and damp weather today, there will be some sunshine in the forecast for the days ahead.  The weather front is bringing in lots of cloud and itaposs where weaposve got rain and drizzle at the moment. Itaposs edging its way eastwards and so itaposs going to turn cloudier in eastern parts. For most, it is going to be rather cloudy. Overall, itaposs going to be a day dominated by grey skies and temperatures will be down accordingly. Overnight, most places will be dry and temperatures sticking in the teens as we head into Thursday morning.

Proposing now what the PM earlier rejected has a whf of the airport quarantine fiasco. The high death rates for retail staff – between % and % above the national average – suggestsface coverings work, they should have been introduced long ago. The Government’s failure to publish detailed evidence or the reasons they waited, dents public confidence in the Prime Minister. It won’t be the £ fines that sees people comply. It will be the urge to do the right thing. The public will yet again show a common sense that’s too often lacking in our dithering, vacillating, error-making, blame-shting PM. Power failure It is of huge concern that two Russian tycoons behind a controversial £.billion energy scheme could pay to share a table with a Cabinet Minister whose department must rule on their venture. Business Secretary Alok Sharma should not let himself be put in potentially compromising positions and have to leave rulings to a junior. Our revelation today, weeks after the property development scandal involving Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, paints a worrying picture of how meetings with top Tory politicians are effectively sold to the wealthy. The Tories must end these cash-for-access fundraisers. They poison our democracy.

Peter Joyce headed out on the Waccamaw River in North Carolina and paddled down into an area he had never explored before. The video shows a serene stretch of water lined by trees and fallen branches, with Peter appearing to be the only one around in the silent surroundings. After believing he heard a fish splash in the water, Peter stops his kayak to take a look around before setting off again. But as he does, an alligator thrusts out of the water in front of him and flips the kayak, leaving him extremely vulnerable. Luckily, he was close enough to some fallen branches to grab the tree and force himself upright, after which he didnapost see the large reptile again.Peter was able to paddle away unharmed and he told WECT : I thought I heard a fish jump to my left -turned out not to be a fish. About three feet from the kayak I made out the head of the gator and that was it, I had no time to react. My mind was playing catch-up at that point. Basically, when I made out the head of the gator towards the front end of the kayak it was kind of just a state of shock. If it hit and there was nothing to grab on the right side of me, I would have inverted. It couldaposve been a lot worse.

Inside, there are a lot of good things to say about the living area.  Although itaposs definitely in need of some modernisation, it has high ceilings, a fireplace and plenty of room for entertaining guests. The kitchen is much smaller and definitely has more work to be done to it with its smoke-stained walls around the cooker. But the laundry room is another issue entirely.  The room is being held up by an old cabinet. In terms of the bedrooms, there are two spacious rooms upstairs, and one on the ground floor to the front of the property.Listing agent Jack McGhee of Ray White-Surry Hills told RealEstate.au that parts of the home were cut off with caution tape.The advert on RealEstate.au says that the house has been held for over half a century with only ever two families in ownership.One of which was reported to have been a chronic smoker, going through two to three packs of cigarettes per day, explaining the stained walls in the property.

Mr Shedworth made headlines at the start of lockdown after shoppers at Aldi in Bristol photographed and filmed him queuing to get in, doing his shopping and paying at the checkout, as reported by Bristol Live.The glare of the cameras is nothing new for the local celebrity, who previously drew attention when he strolled through the city with a shed on his head playing loud techno music, flashing disco lights and spouting flames from the chimney. Mr Shedworth, who once uploaded a video being turned away from a job for wearing a shed on his head, has proved elusive and kept his identity a secret - but has now agreed to do his first interview. Speaking to the Big Jubba’s YakShak music podcast, Mr Shedworth baffled host Jacob Kuenzler-Byrt by conducting the interview insisting the shed is actually his head, that both of his parents are sheds and the structure grew naturally as part of his body. I feel like I need to make it clear Iaposm not just some kind of attention-seeker trying to live out some weird alternate reality, he said. This is my le.  He told the podcast a apossmall lumpapos began to grow on the apex of his roof when he was  that developed into a chimney, and he began to get a glossy coat on the exterior of the shed which just happens with a shedaposs journey into adulthood. Mr Shedworth claims the music which blares from the shed is something internal that comes out of me and brings a lot of unwanted attention. He also says he once had a run in with a council official after falling asleep in a Bristol park, who told him he needed planning permission to be there.  The shed-headed celeb says itaposs just one example of the unwanted attention he is forced to tolerate. It’s not helpful to be recognised in the street as a famous face around town, he said. I want to be able to go to Aldi in peace to buy my bread and my wonky mushrooms and some wood preservative without being ogled and people badgering me in the queue and trying to take selfies with me.

Fire crews were called to the scene at .pm on Tuesday after a blaze broke out at the one-storey bungalow home in Christchurch, New Zealand. But they arrived too late to save the young victims, now named as Brayden, eight, and Arianna, nine months. A fire chief who was at the scene described the inferno as unsurvivable. Commander Mike Bowden said firefighters rescued the -year-old boy from the house but he died from his injuries a shortly after. Neighbours reportedly heard the screams of the man as attempted to crawl inside the burning home who is believed to have suffered injuries during his heroic rescue bid.

Ophiuchus, the snake bearer, falls between  November and  December, sitting between Scorpio and Sagittarius.  A spokesperson for NASA said: “The line from Earth through the sun points to Virgo for  days, but it points to Scorpius for only seven days.  “Besides the  familiar constellations of the zodiac, the sun is also aligned with Ophiuchus for about  days each year.”Personality traits of OphiuchusIf your birthday falls between  November and  December, you were born under Ophiuchus.Ophiuchus shares many of the same characteristics as a Sagittarius. According to AstrologyBay, people who were born under Ophiuchus are intellectual iniduals who seek knowledge.  They have a great sense of humour, and a charismatic personality that others are drawn to.They are straightforward people, and always tell it like it is. They are ethical with a strong sense of justice, and they are very passionate - often thinking with their hearts instead of their heads.However, they can apparently be quite impulsive and can give in to procrastination."},{"url":null,"title":"womans transformation muscle barbie after","story":"NewsWomans transformation into muscle Barbie after hours at gym and strict dietJulia Vins, , from Russia, began lting weights at the age of  and is now a powerlting champion.

Julia Vins from Saratov, Russia started going to the gym at the age of  as she wanted to become more confident in herself and improve her fitness level. The -year-old spent an hour travelling on the bus to get to the gym and was the only woman there – but that didn’t stop her from pursuing her passion. She became focused on improving her mental and physical health as a way to cope with her fatheraposs alcoholism. Julia’s parents orced when she was . She then put all her energy into her education and powerlting with ambitions to go to law school. However, Juliaaposs love for exercise took over and she decided to pursue that professionally instead. Julia said: “I was  years old when I went to the gym. In those days I was in school and had quite a lot of free time. “I wanted my le to be dferent so I decided to play sports to improve my health, become more confident and get fit. “Fitness wasn’t popular here, I had to spend an hour on the bus to get to the gym, and I was only one girl there. “I was born in Kazakhstan, then according to the Volga Germans resettlement program, my parents came here. “I had some problems at school because of my German last name. At  years old I began preparing for the language exam to move to Germany. Then my parents orced and we stayed here.  “My childhood was quite dficult in those days many people didn’t have a job. I had a lot of stress and health problems. “My father couldnapost handle it and got alcohol addiction, that’s why they orced. But my mother was always with me and we supported each other. “I studied a lot, but when I started powerlting, I continued to do this because I was preparing for the exam to go to the law academy.”  Through powerlting, Julia managed to find the strength and determination to pull through, achieving several awards in junior powerlting meets across Russia and is now a two-time world champion at the World Powerlting Congress and has broken several records in the competition. Weighing kg, Julia’s personal records include a kg squat, kg bench press and kg deadlt. Julia trains four to five times a week and eats a strict healthy diet consisting of fish, eggs, vegetables, beans, oats rice and buckwheat pasta as her staple foods.  With her muscular and chiselled physique, Julia is no stranger to odd comments from people who criticise her appearance. Julia said the criticism used to get to her, but instead, she now chooses to focus on the positives and doesn’t listen to the stereotypes based on her gender. She said: “I try not to remember bad things. “Usually people tell me my body is apostoo much’.  But maybeI didn’t do powerlting, I would also think like that, so I donapost care. “I got a lot of terrible comments when I was just starting as a teenager and it really hurt me so much. “Some people from my country tell me that a woman should only cook, raise children, carry out cleaning, and this is her mission. Therefore, they advise me not to waste time on sports. “These are stereotypes and I can do nothing with it. They can’t understand that a woman can do what she wants.”  Julia, who is in a long-term relationship for more than eight years, often receives DMs from admirers – but chooses not to entertain requests as she is happy with her dating le, but still replies to all messages. She said: “Actually I never read this because I always reply to comments on my Instagram so anyone who wants can talk to me. If I answer only to some people in DM, this is not right, I think.” In a few words of advice for women who want to build muscles or are too afraid to go into the gym alone, Julia said: “Don’t listen what other people say, follow your passion.

It’s been a great shame they haven’t been able to celebrate that.“The club will find some way of they get their day with that.“In terms of recruitment and brining players in, I’ll give the players here the opportunity.“I’ll take my time with that. Assurances is a strong word but certainly Dundee United as a club would have the ability to go out and do that,I can bring players that would make Dundee United a better team.“They’d have the ability to go into the market and bring players in that could make the team better.“If the need is there for me to go and do that, and the opportunity to bring players in from other places I believe is a good fit for the culture of the club and making the team better, then absolutely we would have the ability to do that.“The owner has told me he’d back me as has Tony Asghar and I’m happy with that.”As for how United’s embroilment in Hearts and Partick Thistle’s legal case against the SPFL affects his ability to spend, Mellon says that is for those higher up at Tannadice to say.An SFA arbitration  will hear the Jags and Jambos’ petition this week with league champions United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers mounting their own defences in the wake of the initial SPFL resolution and Court of Session action.“I think that’s a question for other people,” he said of the impact United’s legal costs on his playing budget.“I’ve, obviously, been brought here to try to improve a football team.“I’m here try to build relationships with fans and connect everybody, to make players understand the sacrices you need to make to improve and the other stuff will be taken care of by specialists.“They’ll get on with that, that’s what they’re here to do and paid to do, that’s not my remit.“I’ll do what I’m here to do which is digest training, see what I think our players need to do I order to keep moving them forward and then get out on the grass to put on sessions that will challenge them.“Once I see the improvements that need to be made, I’ll be strong with them and keep the standards really high.“I need to keep them fit and motivated and away we go. I’ll do that every day.“That’s just the way I work and operate as a manager. It’s stood me in good stead and I won’t change that.”Mellon’s track record in developing players is impressive with Leicester star Jamie Vardy one of his students at Fleetwood Town and Manchester City ace John Stones another at Barnsley.However, the Paisley-born coach was keen to point out another in Rangers defender Connor Goldson, whom Mellon had at Shrewsbury.He hopes to repeat those kind of successes at United.He added: “I had Connor Goldson. We developed him into a fantastic centre-back and sold him to Brighton for millions.“You take your time with them and see what they need to get better at. It was the same with Vardy, Stones and these kind of guys.“You look at it and know the qualities that’s needed for them to be a top player.“You recognise it and because I’ve been through it before and been successful with it before because the proof is there with the boys playing at unbelievable levels, I’m able to bring that to this group of players.“I know the techniques that are needed to show them. The training sessions or talking to them about things in a way they can grasp and understand to make them top players as well.“I really enjoy doing that and I’m so proud of all the boys who have turned out top players.”CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises\" title\"#CALUM WOODGER: New Dundee United boss Micky Mellon is making all the right noises# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-new-dundee-united-micky-mellon-making-right-noises embed # secretZZoTJol\" data-secret\"ZZoTJol\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He has watched closely and put his own inputs where he has felt he has had to, which has been good.“He has been down south all his managerial career and he comes here with new ideas and he is another top manager that we can learn from.“It is an exciting time for the whole club going into the Premiership and with the new manager coming in.“He comes across as a real players’ manager.“He told us that right at the start, for us to do well he needs us to do well.“He has told us his door is always open and he is always there to help.“We know that he is demanding and he will want to maintain the standards he has set in his time in England.“His record in England is great. He has five promotions and you can’t argue with that. It is definitely exciting times.”Former Rangers and Dunfermline man Clark was a key component of the Tangerines’ Championship title winning squad from last term.He is now hoping Mellon gives him and the other medal winners a chance to prove they can do it in the Premiership.Clark added: “The boys were excellent last season and we deservedly won the league although it wasn’t the way we wanted it to be.“At the end of the day we are champions and it is good to hear the manager will give us a chance.“However, we all know that he will bring in some new faces and over the next few days and weeks because he will want to strengthenthere are areas where he feels he needs to strengthen.“We will have to work hard and keep strivingwe want to keep raising the standards to meet the challenge of the Premiership week in, week out.”Clark ed from six months out with an ankle injury in a - friendly defeat at Motherwell on Saturday.It wasn’t the result the Terrors were after but the former Queen of the South man was just delighted to get back on the pitch.He commented: “It was a good run out. It has been a long time coming for me because it was my first game since January but it was good to get out there and going again.“It was exciting to be back playing again. I could have been backthe season hadn’t been cut short but this extra time has given me more opportunity to get everything % right and a good pre-season behind me.“It was a mix of experienced boys and younger lads but it was a good game.“We got beat - but at this stage it is all about fitness and boys coming through injury free.“The boys have all come back flying. They all tuned into it during the lockdown and we are reaping the benefits of that fitness now.”Dundee United boss Micky Mellon reveals he has backing of owner Mark Ogren in transfer market\" title\"#Dundee United boss Micky Mellon reveals he has backing of owner Mark Ogren in transfer market# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-micky-mellon-mark-ogren embed # secretrQTIok\" data-secret\"rQTIok\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Now at Aberdeen Maritime Museum, it would have sat above the royal arms at the very top of the arch.It has been decorated with alternate crosses and fleurs-de-lis. The bottom has been painted to look like a crown trimmed in ermine whilst the main band and arches are painted gold and decorated with bright jewels and pearls. When the Royal Yacht entered the harbour, it was able to moor directly alongside the quay. It demonstrates the forethought and ingenuity of Aberdeen and its harbour: at no other dock in the British empire was this possible at this time.Queen Victoria and her family arrived  hours early, catching the expectant Aberdonians off-guard.

Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"midweek joy for golfer david","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDavid Ronald took the honours in the first midweek stableford at Tarbert Golf Club, with a fantastic score of  points.He was on target to break  for the first time but finished with a double bogey for a , still a great score.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

The results of a study, released last month, by an international research team led by the Centre for Environmental and Marine Studies estimated that m birds are killed on European roads every year.The number of birds killed by wind turbines, whilst regrettable, is dwarfed by the numbers killed by cats and by road vehicles.Brian Moore, Edinburgh EH.GOLDEN THREADSRUSSELL Leadbetters Those were the days feature on Fridaybrought back for me many memories.

Scotlandrsquos unspoilt scenery plays a vital role in encouraging people to enjoy our country and support businesses, but this can only happenareas of beauty remain in their original pristine state.The partners behind the campaign jointly condemn scenes of abandoned campsites, burned out trees and human waste, as well as litter, as being hugely damaging to Scotlandrsquos reputationIain Gulland, Chief executive of Zero Waste ScotlandIain Gulland, Zero Waste Scotland chief executive, said:ldquoPeople are understandably keen to enjoy everything Scotland has to offer as the summer holidays stretch out in front of us. With tourism re-opening in Scotland and many areas ndash from hills and lochs in rural Scotland, to city parks ndash expecting an increase in visitors, we want to remind people to bin their litter or take it home. ldquoThis opportunity to get outdoors is great news. If you are camping, exercising, having a barbecue or just enjoying the scenery, have fun, but remember to bin what you donrsquot need or take it with you. Go home with happy memories and leave the place litter free so others can do the same. We know Scotland is stunning, letrsquos keep it that way!The Scotland is Stunning ndash Letrsquos Keep It That Way campaign will be rolled out across social media channels from today , for five weeks across Scotland. Partners and community groups are encouraged to download the free campaign toolkit, which includes digital tools and posters and are available for anyone who wants to get the message to daytrippers and staycationers to bin litter or take it home.As well as being an eyesore, dropping litter is a criminal offence. Discarded waste can also be a danger to young children and animals and it is estimated that % of marine litter washing up on our beaches started out on land.Perth-based Willowgate Activity Centre takes visitors on adventure days out to enjoy activities such as kayaking, paddle boarding and open water swimming. The company runs regular community litter picks and nature education programmes, and recently reopened after being closed for  weeks due to coronavirus.Emily Hamilton-Peach with litter collected from the River TayEmily Hamilton-Peach, assistant manager at Willowgate, said:ldquoWe regularly see litter that has floated down the River Tay from people leaving it in the park and this volume has recently increased. A lot of our customers come to us because they want to get close to nature, enjoy the sights and see the city from a dferent side, it can spoil it for themthe river and banks are left in a state. We try to pick it as we see it but there is only so much you can do.Barry Fisher, Chief Executive of Keep Scotland BeautulBarry Fisher, CEO of Keep Scotland Beautul, commented:ldquoWe welcome this new campaign highlighting the beauty of Scotland and all it has to offer. Litter levels across Scotland are unacceptable, and in many places are getting much worse. Alongside this campaign we will continue to offer support to all those who have already stepped up to tackle this problem in their own communities with litter clean ups and projects to improve and protect the places they care about.The campaign can be followed on social media at #BinYourLitterTo download the campaign toolkit, or further details please visit managingourwaste.scot litter"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Iain Macwhirter  The chlorinated chickens are now coming home to roost","story":"And this week, the chlorinated chickens have come home to roost.

Or at the very least make a decent fist of a fascinating story.Made by  Films, the production company behind  , a six part series on the attacks on the US, the first episode featured many of the usual suspects ndash Piers Morgan, once a Murdoch editor, Alastair Campbell, ex-press secretary to Blair, etc ndash saying pretty much what you would expect.The strength of the piece lay in the way it built a story about power: who had it and who did not, and what that meant for the rest of us.So the first episode laid bare the great Blair-Murdoch bromance, begun in earnest when the Labour leader flew to Australia to woo the media boss and his executives. According to Campbell, Murdoch said his rapprochement with Blair was like two porcupines making love: it had to be done very slowly and very carefully. ldquoBit f****** weird, said Campbell.It got weirder. Once New Labour was in government, having secured the backing of the Murdoch empire, the relationship became ldquoalmost incestuous, said Andrew Neil.How close they became was illustrated by the tale of Blair and the euro. In a piece for the News of the World, Blair promised that the UK would not join the EU currency without a referendum. This, according to Nigel Farage, was the price of Murdochrsquos support for New Labour ndash asked and granted.ldquoIf Rupert Murdoch had not done that we would have joined the euro in  and I doubt Brexit would have happened, claimed Farage.What happened next in the programme was more remarkable. The interview over, Faragersquos lapel microphone was taken off. But the main mic was still running.ldquoTo be honest, said Farage, relaxing into off camera mode even though the recording was still going on, ldquoI did ask him whether he wanted me to do this, andhe said no I wouldnrsquot have done it. But he said yes, do it.Now, presuming ldquohe was Murdoch, did this mean the media boss was trying to spin a documentary about himself, to make himself look even more powerful That the filmmakers included the Farage \"extra\" was a promising sign that they were ready to engage in some journalistic rough and tumble of their own to get the story. One fancied Mr Murdoch,he was watching, might have approved.The film had promised to look at the ldquorise and fall and rise again of the dynasty, and by the end of episode one we had entered the phone hacking saga, the point at which the empire quaked.Throughout, the most fascinating segments were those looking at the Murdoch heirs. Much of the material on that subject came from an ABC Australia series, Dynasties: The Murdochs. Whether there will be anything new to add on this, and any other matter, depends on those who have worked most closely with Murdoch speaking out.Thus far, no dice. The most noteworthy thing said by Les Hinton, who worked for Murdoch for  years, concerned a get-to-know you dinner between his boss and the Blairs. ldquoCheriersquos a bit strange but I like him, was Murdochrsquos assessment. Hardly stop the press stuff, but stick around: there might be more to come."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-tate-greenock-can-give-perspective-links-slavery","story":"I read with interest that MSP Stuart McMillan proposes that they be made into a museum detailing Scotlandrsquos links with the slave trade .Until  the building was used by sugar refiners Tate and Lyle. The Tate part of the name is the family that founded the Tate Gallery in London, now named Tate Britain. Galleries have subsequently been established in London , St Ives and Liverpool. The Tate Liverpool is in a building and setting very similar to the Greenock Sugar Sheds.The sugar sheds are massive. I understand that the Tate has a huge amount of paintings in storage. The establishment of a ldquoTate Greenock, incorporating an exhibition of Glasgowrsquos links to slavery as an adjunct to a gallery of paintings would be a wonderful way of illustrating Greenockrsquos history in the round.Bruce Walker, Largs.IT was very encouraging to see your report about proposals to use the old sugar sheds at Watt Dock in Greenock for a museum about Scotlandrsquos connections with slavery.This would be an excellent venue by the Clyde where the great sugar and tobacco loads were deposited. It would also be a way of bringing much-needed public and private investment into Inverclyde. MSP Stuart McMillanrsquos proposal to seek support from those firms and families who were associated with slavery would be a practical way of making reparations.The link with Rabbie Burns and his proposed le in plantation administration is another aspect of th century Scottish le that would be worthy of further exploration. Unlike some, I would not be too critical of Burnss plans to move to Jamaica given the poverty and brutality of Scottish farming le at that time. His beautul tribute, A Slaversquos Lament, shows his empathy for those trapped in the terrible circumstances of slavery. I doubt he would have lasted long in Jamaica.On frequent trips to Liverpool I have been a visitor to the wonderful Slavery Museum on the Quayside. On every visit there has been a very erse collection of visitors-schoolchildren, tourists and families of all backgrounds from the North West. The many exhibitions feature commentaries from young people from local schools and visitors. It is very clear from their input that they have taken the museumrsquos message about the need for tolerance and respect for human rights, very seriously.A Scottish museum about slavery would open up many opportunities for students and researchers to produce original material. There are many stories waiting to be told about those ex slaves who became part of Scottish nineteenth Century le and active in radical politics welcoming ex-slave, abolitionist Frederick Douglass on his tours from  onwards.This would be a very worthwhile project to support the Black Lives Matter Campaign.Maggie Chetty, Glasgow G."},{"url":null,"title":"mother-superior-new-whisky-pub-built-bartenders-open-leith-walk-edinburgh","story":"They have been working tirelessly during the coronavirus lockdown to make the dreams of Jane Nolan and partner Nick come true - in the form of a brand-new whisky bar on Leith Walk set to open its doors on Monday.The Mother Superior, inspired initially by the film that many say put Edinburgh on the movie map, is a bar made from bartenders according to Jane, who hopes itll pull in whisky lovers and those new to the dram through its doors.\"Theres a thing about whisky that you have to spend loads of money and know the tasting nodes,\" she admits. \"But I dont think thats the way it should be.:Diageo unveils lsquoworldrsquos first plastic-free paper-based whisky bottle\"If you enjoy whisky, you enjoy whisky.

Our bartenders have so many passions outside of work, and we want to incorporate them.When the pub hits the ground running, the team eventually want to organise some merchandise, which will see part of the profits go to drug rehabilitation charities in the local area.Jane said: ldquoItrsquos important to me, and itrsquos important to the area.

In order to allay concerns regarding public safety, VisitScotland, alongside the national tourism bodies of England, Northern Ireland and Wales, announced a new UK-wide industry standard and consumer mark to provide confidence for visitors, communities and tourism businesses alike, as the sector works towards reopening.Since its launch, last month, over , businesses have signed up to the ‘We’re Good to Go’ scheme. A new visitor charter was also created by the national tourism organisation aimed at encouraging safe and responsible travel around the country. Businesses are currently updating their listings on visitscotland with opening information to make it easier for visitors to plan ahead.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive said: “Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover.#The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen. It’s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.“July  marks a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this ‘new normal’, so it’s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.“We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone — visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.“For more information on travelling in Scotland visit visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

After monitoring for some time to assess the condition of the animal, and to ascertain whether it was entangled or not, medics were happy that the animal was free-swimming and not caught on anything, however it is in poor condition, for which the prognosis is not good. Unfortunately, as the tide as dropped the animal stranded in shallow water. Medics say that they have remained on scene throughout the day, to monitor its breathing rate from the safety of the shore, and to ensure it is not disturbed “whilst nature takes its course.”They added that unfortunately, with a whale of this size, humane euthanasia to prevent further suffering is not an option, and with it being in very poor health and malnourished it would be highly unlikely to survive at sea. Whilst this whale is not fully grown, it is likely to weigh in excess of  tonnes, which means whilst it is stranded out of the water it is crushing itself under its own bodyweight which will cause internal damage too. Unfortunately refloating a whale of this size once it has stranded is also impossible due to its size and weight. Adult fin whales can reach in excess of  metres inand weigh up to  tonnes.The medics added: “Whilst medics are on the scene monitoring the whale, the landowner has requested that no one  attends and we would ask that everyone please respects his wishes. The local Coastguard team have also been in attendance too.”An update will follow.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It will see the installation of a new  kilovoltcable which follows the existing route from Murkle Bay, near Thurso, to Rackwick Bay in Hoy. The cable is expected to arrive by Wednesday next week, July .SSEN has said the installation of the new cable will allow for the removal of some sections of existing overhead line on Hoy, to be replaced with underground cable. Work is expected to be completed by November, following an extension of the programme to avoid construction during bird breeding season on the island.Mark Rough, director of customer operations, with SSEN, said: “We’re committed to ensuring a safe, secure and reliable supply of electricity to our customers and this critical investment project is an essential part of that commitment.“We’d like to thank all stakeholders for their feedback on our proposals during our open-door events last year. Following consultation, we’ve scheduled installation to minimise disruption on local marine le, with the works also planned to avoid the main breeding seasons for key bird populations.“I’d like to reassure our customers that our teams and contracting partners continue to adhere to social distancing measures and Government guidance to protect the safety of the local community as we carry out this signicant programme of works.”The Pentland Firth East cable was identied for replacement after routine inspections found it was coming to the end of its operational le. In July , SSEN successfully completed repairs to the cable in Rackwick Bay following a cable fault. While customer power supplies were not impacted by this fault, a long-term solution was required to maintain a safe, secure and reliable power supply to homes and businesses in Orkney.For more information on the Pentland Firth East cable replacement project, click here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

positions could be Chris Mackinnon, Murdo Gordon, John Finlayson, Robert Macaskill or even Dan Macdonald.Chris was  , Murdo#s halves were  , John#s loops were  , Robert was   and finally young Dan was  .All these guys have a chance depending on how the leaders perform next time out but an honourable mention for John Finlayson who, like Ally Young in the RNLI Shield last time out compiled a fine score in the worst of the conditions.Sunday dawned cold, wet and very windy and both he and his companion for the day wondered at the outset whether they would be able to complete their round as the greens were already holding water.Two birdies in the final three holes of the first nine must have inspired John to dig in and that is exactly what he did to retain his chance of qualication.Although the competition is played off scratch the four players with the best two-round handicap scores will compete for the consolation #handicap# championship.A meritorious performance here to consider for inclusion might well come from Hamish Philp whose nett  off a  handicap was a terric performance in his renaissance as a golfer.Obviously off that highish handicap his numbers won#t compare too favourably with the #lower# men but two loops of  and  in the steady Saturday morning rain should give him a tremendous boost of confidence for both round two and the rest of this fledgling season Sunday morning#s weather conditions meant the scheduled ladies’ competition was abandoned without a ball being hit.However, a couple of days later a lovely sunny and warm Tuesday welcomed a small group for another round in the Glamaig Stableford competition and yet again Sandi Beatson was declared to be the clear winner.That#s four successive victories and this time the margin was six points over her nearest pursuants Sandra Dew and Shona Jackson.With respect the scoring wasn#t great but was readily acceptable within the confines of the competitors and that#s plenty good enough.The first midweek competition of this much-delayed men#s season was played for the Strath Cup.This trophy is usually decided on a season-long, best three from four scores basis but the club mandarins have to cut and paste a structure in this necessarily compressed playing season to keep the members and competitors happy so it was all or nothing in one single day.And what a day it turned out to be with warm sunshine and just a whisper of a breeze for the thirteen hours of competition.The fly in the ointment though was John-the-Greens# concept of what constitutes a #challenging# hole position on his well-nourished, nicely manicured putting surfaces.Rumour has it that he#s #a bit of a player# but as he#s yet to strike a single ball in anger the jury remains quite positively indecisive on that one.However, on the assumption that he does actually play the #great game# his mischievous positioning of pins-when he doesn#t have to try to access them-is causing some consternation and rabble#s babble.Irrespective of the pin positions however, Batman and Robin were at it again as playing companions for yet another highly successful day.Archie Macaskill and John Maclean reprised their excellent performances from round one of the Club Championship last weekend to finish first and second respectively.Off the tee in the second group of the day and having overtaken the trio of old boys in front they were the first players to log their scores and their totals were to remain nonpareil all day long despite a mighty challenge from the large group of competitors.Archie won the trophy and took the honours with  points, his two nines being  and .Going out-of-bounds with his tee shot on the fourth hole was to cost him an  but he immediately secured a birdie  on the very next hole to get him up and running again.Celebrating his th birthday on the course that very day the youngster went on to finish strongly with two more birdies in the final three holes of his round-great stuff and very well done.John Maclean is playing more golf than for many a year as the pandemic has meant that his tourism-related business is closed and is likely to remain so for the time being.But that has allowed him to play more golf, work on his game and slowly but surely his handicap is coming down. shots were required for the first half and  for the second was good enough for  points and also included three birdies so the dynamic duo obviously gel very well on the golf course.Eased out of second place by virtue of the better inward half Lou Gordon nevertheless ed a highly creditable score of pts.Lou navigated the outward half of his round in a miserly  shots and like Archie and John also had three birdies-in the space of five holes. But two lost balls off the th tee unfortunately put paid to his chances of victory.Graham Smith and Ryan Macaskill were the #best of the rest# as they both signed for respectable pts totals # the former easing the latter by….you know the story by now Graham required  blows for his first lap but a sparkling  shots for the second lap with five straight pars to finish showed guts, determination and the promise of things to come Ryan is fairly steady off his  handicap and   was pretty well run of the mill scoring for him. An incident-free round.Honourable mention in this competition for Andrew Long who after a faltering start turned-to in good order slotting four birdies in the run-in, including three birdies in the first four holes of lap two.This weekend the ladies will be competing for the #First Minister#s Quaich# while the gentlemen will play for the #Iain Campbell Memorial Trophy# # in scramble format # on Saturday with a pop-up Bogey competition scheduled for Sunday.On reflection then the golf season on the Isle of Skye is successfully up and running, the course is in excellent trim but still the times are strange.Quite correctly denied the use of the clubhouse to date and sadly for the foreseeable future the club lacks a focal point and with competitors playing with their pals social integration and interaction is exiguous to say the very least.It#s important that we appreciate and enjoy what we#ve got, reflect on what was missing from our lives for the three months of lockdown and just play golf and look forward to a brighter future.:  S Beatson pts .S Dew pts bih  S Jackson pts.: Leading Scores. .

And in addition to Mel Gibson#s epic offering, Gary said that there are plans to host another two films in August as well as a spooktacular screening in October.#Because the event was so popular, we have organised another two films for nd and rd of August as well.#After that, we have plans to screen movies on Halloween # we#ll probably show a family-type film such as Ghostbusters # because it will be darker earlier # and then we#ll be able to show a classic horror film at midnight, which will be really cool!#: #As a big film fan I’ve been known to travel hundreds of miles to see a particular film, so the opportunity to see a classic like Back to the Future at a drive-in cinema on Skye was an unmissable cultural event. #This is a film which as a nine-year-old I saw five times in the cinema and have lost count how many times I’ve seen it since. #This event proved just how vital, uplting, and unique the cinema experience can be, and one which we will all remember for years to come. #I can’t wait until the next time!#The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3210341.jpg--.jpg?1593777277000\n","title":"buick pupils efforts earn school an eco flag honour","story":"Buick Memorial Primary School in Cullybackey has been awarded a prestigious Eco-Schools Green Flag by the environmental charity Keep Northern Ireland Beautul. The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

It shows that the overwhelming majority of Catholic schools teach a more modern unit, which covers - and majors on the civil rights campaign and the Troubles.But just under half of state schools teach the - period instead, which features the Second World War.The survey was carried out by two Year  classes in Stoke-on-Trent and Lancaster during lockdown. Read MoreMichael Davies:Opinion Why NI syllabus needs to be rewritten so pupils can learn both #sides# of the story It was conducted under the auspices of the Parallel Histories charity. Its founder Michael Davies revealed tothat a definitive bias along denominational lines was found.Four out of  state schools, for which data was available, taught the earlier - unit, compared with just one in  Catholic schools.Mr Wilson said he believed this was because those teachers viewed their audience as less homogenous than in Catholic schools. Maybe they are more fearful of offending pupils in this era of oversensitive snowflake students, or in some instances snowflake parents, said the DUP#s Westminster education spokesperson.Mr Wilson, a former teacher, added: Also, there seems to be this middle-class Protestant guilt complex among many history teachers who seem to be unwilling to challenge some of the nonsense which is portrayed in history text books. I can remember parents raging about some of the content of textbooks when I was teaching and I used to protest to the history department, without any success.Mr Wilson said it was ironic that Catholic schools have been far more willing to take teaching material produced by the Orange Order. State schools and voluntary schools seem to think that it might demonstrate some kind of religious or political bias. SDLP West Tyrone MLA Daniel McCrossan said: It#s concerning that there#s such a clear correlation between the religious background of a school and the period of our recent history that they choose to teach. There#s a real risk thatyoung people don#t engage with the parts of our history that may be uncomfortable or challenging for them, that we#ll double down on ision for another generation.Every GCSE history student here should have an equal opportunity to explore our struggle for civil rights as well as learning about the contribution that people from Northern Ireland made in the fight against fascism. Learning more about each other, experiencing everyone#s history, can only ever be a good thing and we need to be encouraging it as early as possible.Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong said: For far too long those invested in ision have enabled and prolerated segregation through education. Constant reflection on how CCMS #saved# Catholic education, or the DUP#s belief kids all should be brought into the state-controlled system, hides the fact our education system is failing to meet the needs of children.She said that the CCEA curriculum enabled teachers to pick modules and parts of coursework they recognise and with which they were comfortable. It#s easier to teach one side of the narrativethat#s the only narrative you have known, she said.By maintaining separate teacher training colleges and the exemption from Fair Employment in schools, we are allowing a Troubles narrative to permeate our teaching body. In turn this continues to teach segregated norms, when most of us wish to move away from the old way of looking at things.

Photo by Peter MorrisonMark BainTwitterEmailJuly   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFour months ago, the future looked bleak for Co Fermanagh beauty therapist Jeanette Guy.Having already been forced to pull the shutters down on her Flawless Beauty salon in Irvinestown, and with her other role at the spa in Lough Erne Golf Resort on hold due to Covid-, the prospect of losing the business she had spent eight years building up was very real.In the end the answer to her worries was closer to home than she thought and rather than sit back and let her salon dreams disappear she embarked on some new business-building of her own.let embedUrl  https:belfasttelegraph.bbvms p twocol_article c .jstry .textContentembedUrl +  dart_gs_channels +  catchconst el  documentel.async  trueel.src  embedUrldocument.getElementByIdChildJust a few weeks later she#s taken working from home to a whole new level and completed her own fully equipped day-spa and beauty salon in her back garden.The beauty industry has been hit really hard by coronavirus, said Jeanette, who will be welcoming the first clients to her newly constructed business base this morning.I actually had to close down the salon a couple of weeks earlier than others as my severe asthma put me in the high risk category. I had to shield, so I just couldn#t work.For a while at the start it was very dficult to see a way back, she said.I bought a hot tub to cheer myself up at the start of all this as I knew I#d be spending a lot of time at home, but by Easter time, when there looked to be little prospect of getting back to the salon in the near future, I started to think about ways to try to keep the business going before it was too late.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJeanette Guy from Irvinestown turned a space in her garden into a beauty salon day spa.The log cabin was built fully equipped for all beauty treatments and a hot tub which is complimentary for clients.Photo by Peter Morrison FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJeanette Guy from Irvinestown turned a space in her garden into a beauty salon day spa.The log cabin was built fully equipped for all beauty treatments and a hot tub which is complimentary for clients.Photo by Peter MorrisonI started to think that maybe working from home was going to be the future for me.My kids, Sasha and Corey, were out in the garden, helping to tidy things up and paint fences. The space was there so I thought why not give it a go  It just seemed too good an idea not to try, said Jeanette.Jeanette#s boyfriend, Kieran Fee, by day a plumber based in Dublin, stepped in and despite neither of them having any real building experience, they took the plunge and set about creating a home-designed, purpose built log cabin around the hot tub.To be honest, we had no idea how it would turn out. Neither of us have done anything like this before, but we worked hard, roped in the kids to help and a couple of Kieran#s friends.Jeanette is just putting the finishing touches to her new spa, which also houses her own beauty salon, ready for the first clients to arrive.It#s exciting but I#m nervous too as you never know what people will think until you let them come in, she said.I#m lucky that I had built up a good number of loyal customers over the years and hopefully they will see the effort I#ve put in to keep the business going and continue to support me.We had no professional help, no contractors and learned as we went along. We started off with a base of  wooden pallets and just went from there, learning all the time, coming up with new ideas along the way.It#s a complete DIY job but I#m delighted with the way it#s turned out. I got exactly what I wanted.I#m always tempted now just to go in there and lock the door to have the place to myself, but as it#s separate from the house I can close the door on the business at night and walk away, eventhat is hard to do!Jeanette is again ready to offer the full range of day spa and beauty treatments, but admitted she#s still nervous about getting the business up and running again.At the start of this I didn#t knowit would survive, she said. Like so many more in the beauty industry the work just stopped overnight with no idea of when we would be able to get back to working again earning money again.I was terried in this first few weeks. I#m terried again but for a dferent reason. We#ve put a lot of hard work into this project and getting it ready to operate. Now the scary bit is seeingit takes off.But I think a lot more beauty salons will be looking at the option of operating from home in the future. It will be a struggle for all of them to survive after what has been a terribly scary time.Find out more about Jeanette#s Flawless Beauty at www.facebook Flawlessbeautybynetty   Belfast   Most ReadUnmasked: The parts of Northern Ireland worst affected by Covid-Malachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesTwelfth : Hundreds ignored social distancing, but Orange Order insists #vast majority# complied Coronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyFace masks QA: How to stop glasses steaming up, and can you use the same one twice ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Lisa SmythTwitterJuly   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailCovid- claimed more lives in east Belfast than in any other part of Northern Ireland during the first spike of the deadly virus, it can be revealed.Official figures have provided a comprehensive breakdown of the Covid- death rates, according to each victim#s usual postcode up to the end of May.They have shown that the deaths of  residents in parts of east Belfast - including some of the most affluent parts of the city, such as Stormont and Ballyhackamore - were registered by May . A further  deaths of people living in Castlereagh, Clarawood, Gilnahirk and Knock had been registered by the same date.All parts of Belfast were badly affected by the virus, according to the figures released by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency .There were  Covid- deaths registered in north Belfast, which takes in the likes of Crumlin Road, Ardoyne and New Lodge. A further  deaths were registered for people with postcodes in the area including the Shankill Road and Ballygomartin.There were  deaths attributed to the virus in south Belfast, although the figures show that Saintfield Road, Four Winds, Carryduff, Knockbreda and Newtownbreda were worse affected than the Malone Road, Ormeau and Lisburn Road areas.The figures do not state where the person died or where they contracted the virus.However, a number of care homes known to have been at the centre of deadly outbreaks have postcodes matching areas where the NISRA figures show there were a large number of deaths.They have been released as latest Department of Health statistics reveal the death of a hospital patient in Belfast was reported on Friday. No further deaths have been reported. One patient with Covid- is receiving treatment in an intensive care unit.Alliance Party MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of the Stormont health committee, welcomed the publication of the statistics but called for a full analysis of the data. In particular, Ms Bradshaw said random Covid- testing should be carried out in areas that have experienced high death rates.What we see here is clear evidence of a bias towards urban areas and, in particular, towards locations with care homes, she said.There appears also to be something of a disconnect between where people have died and where people have come forward to be tested. Three issues arise. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe first question is why this information is not more readily available by postcode, including currently with reference to contact tracing. As increasingly, people have to manage risk themselves, they need to be fully informed.The second issue is to ensure that people come forward for testing. We are not using our full testing capacity, indeed there were well under , iniduals tested in the last  hours, so I would urge anyone with symptoms to make the call immediately and get tested.The third point is that, given our testing capacity is not being fully utilised, surely we should now have wider surveillance testing  Should areas like BT now have random testing among the entire population, including antibody testing and perhaps compared with other postcode areas, to see what the prevalence of the virus is or has been This information would be vital to improving our understanding of the virus to ensure we can respond more effectively to any future outbreaks.The Department of Health has been contacted for comment.

Erecting a statue at Windsor Park in recognition of his achievements would be a matter, in the first instance, for the Irish Football Association to consider.I would be happy to lend my support to any campaign that recognises achievements. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSupport: Caral Ni Chuilin FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSupport: Caral Ni ChuilinI would be delighted to extend an invitation to Pat to attend the department#s annual Celebration of Sport event, which recognises sporting achievement while also promoting opportunities for participation and inclusion in sport among our young people.Mr Newton said fans backing the campaign should be encouraged by the minister#s support.Pat#s record as a world-class goalkeeper,  caps for his country, stands favourable comparison with renowned goalkeepers across the world, he said.His  years playing at international level is a record others can only stand back and admire. A statue erected at Windsor Park would, I believe, find favour with the vast majority of Northern Ireland supporters and football fans in general. It#s for those supporters who respect the achievements of Pat Jennings and for the IFA to take the matter forward. Lelong fan Doug Nashfrom Aldershot is leading the campaign and said he was delighted by the latest development.He also revealed that the response from the IFA had been encouraging so far, with more talks expected as business continues toto normal in the coming months.Mr Nash added that the proposed bronze statue would likely be ft tall, and that he was also calling for a knighthood for the big Newry man.I have spoken to one member of the IFA who is really keen on the idea and said he couldn#t see why it couldn#t happen, he said.I have about , followers on Twitter and not one person has a bad thing to say about the campaign or Pat.In my opinion he#s not only one of the best goalkeepers ever, but he does so much behind the scenes that people don#t know about.I#m sure Pat will live to be , but I would love for him to be there when it#s unveiled.Mr Nash said he will now wait to hear more from the IFA before starting any fundraising activities.He has since spoken to sculptor Andrew Edwards, who created the statue of England World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks outside Stoke City#s stadium.His work is amazing and he said he would be honoured to help create a statue of Pat. He said he#s willing to create a miniature version of the statue I could use at any presentations.Interestingly enough, he said as well that statues are made one-fth bigger than real le because bronze appears smaller.Obviously Pat is ft tall, so the statue would end up being ft tall.

The vessel famously opened the D-Day barrage as allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy on June , Ballymena man Jonathan Barr purchased the historical item from an auction house for , .It had been part of a collection of Second World War flags owned by retired US Admiral Dr Clarence Rungee.Speaking to the Belfastfrom his home in London, Mr Barrsaid he could not pass up a chance to own a part of history when it came up for sale last month.Being from Northern Ireland, HMS Belfast has a place in my heart and my grandfather fought in the war as well, he said.Constructed by Harland  Wolff in the s, HMS Belfast is the most signicant surviving Royal Navy warship from the Second World War.Apart from action on D-Day, it also served in the Arctic Convoys and in the Korean War.Today the Town-class light cruiser is permanently moored on the River Thames and remains a top visitor attraction for the Imperial War Museum.Mr Barr said he often walks past HMS Belfast and hopes he can reunite it with the flag for others to view.My dad actually spotted it on the auction site and I#ve always been interested in that type of thing having studied history and thought it would be good to bring it back to these shores.Having just marked the th anniversaryD-Day, and when the world seems very topsy-turvy, it seems serendipitous to get hold of that part of history and have it in Northern Irish hands.Mr Barr said he has already received an offer of £, for the flag, but maintains he has no plans to ever sell it.A description on the auction listing said the Belfast#s Jack was flown at the bow of the ship when at anchor or under special circumstances.The wool bunting with a roped canvas bears the markings showing the D-Day landings, #- NORMANDY#.It adds: The jack of the Belfast is in good condition. It is used, worn, soiled and stained, but otherwise it is complete.Belfast Most ReadUnmasked: The parts of Northern Ireland worst affected by Covid-Malachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesTwelfth : Hundreds ignored social distancing, but Orange Order insists #vast majority# complied Coronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskeyFace masks QA: How to stop glasses steaming up, and can you use the same one twice ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While not from a farming background, he represents a large rural area and also plugs the hole in the Cabinet on the lack of representation from the west of Ireland. Mr Calleary is the Fianna Fail deputy leader.Mr Martin said he asked Mr Cowen to publicly address new questions about the night he was stopped for drink-driving but the Offaly TD said he would not be making any further comment.This decision has created a situation where legitimate doubts and additional questions are being raised, and Government colleagues are expected to address these. This is simply untenable, the Taoiseach said.Mr Martin said he was forced to contact President Michael D Higgins to terminate Mr Cowen#s appointment as a cabinet minister.The Taoiseach had given Mr Cowen the day to consider addressing the outstanding questions but when he called him yesterday evening the minister still refused to publicly address the matter.Mr Martin asked Mr Cowen for his resignation but this too was refused and the Taoiseach was left with no choice but to sack the minister. The Taoiseach discussed his decision to sack Mr Cowen with Tanaiste Leo Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, who both supported the move.In a statement, Mr Cowen said he was surprised and disappointed by the Taoiseach#s decision to fire him via a phone call yesterday evening.He said he furnished the Taoiseach with all the facts regarding his drink-driving case, including confidential details of his interactions with gardai.Ten days ago and this afternoon, the Taoiseach believed my failure of  didn#t warrant my removal from office but he now appears to have changed his mind based on a Pulse file I gave him this morning, Mr Cowen said.He said the file was leaked in contravention of the protections every citizen is entitled to expect in their interaction with gardai.He said Mr Martin#s decision to remove him from office had undermined and potentially prejudiced his entitlement to fair process.Last night, Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told RTE#s #Prime Time# that Mr Varadkar did not demand Mr Cowen#s removal from Government. He said the sacking was something that Fine Gael obviously are not happy about and that it is clearly not good for the Government.A senior Fianna Fail source said a series of questions had been emerging, and specically from the weekend, and it was unfair that Mr Cowen#s other Government colleagues were being forced to address them.It came as the Government looked set to be on a serious collision course with An Garda Siochana over accusations made by Mr Cowen about his drink-driving ban.Mr Cowen sparked a new crisis for the Government after alleging gardai incorrectly entered information about his arrest into official records and leaked the file.The move has sparked anger in Garda Headquarters, with one senior source saying it was very strange for a Cabinet minister to launch an attack on serving members of the force.If the guards involved stand over the version of events on the file, we won#t be changing the record, the senior source added.Gardai are currently investigating Mr Cowen#s claim that his Garda record is inaccurate.Belfast Most ReadUnmasked: The parts of Northern Ireland worst affected by Covid-Malachi O#DohertyOpinionSo, Gerry Adams waits  years to tell us he doesn#t believe in consent principle and no one even noticesTwelfth : Hundreds ignored social distancing, but Orange Order insists #vast majority# complied Face masks QA: How to stop glasses steaming up, and can you use the same one twice Coronavirus: Wearing masks like using a sheep fence to halt mosquitoes, says leading Northern Ireland GP Anne McCloskey,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I have had several queries from dferent sources about why we can’t just go back to normal appointments. I have prepared a short pieceyou wished to publish in your respective papers. Due to COVID- GP practices have had to adapt like everyone . Despite the wishes of staff and patients that we go back to normal services which includes letting people book their own appointments, it just isn’t possible. googletag.cmd.push We have a duty to all patients as well as our staff. Before any attendance at the practice you will be contacted to make sure you do not have COVID- symptoms. This will be similar for any appointments. We must also remind people not to attend any public placeyou are ill as you should be isolating and getting tested. All services like immunisations, and advice regarding any condition can still be accessed. Practices have become very efficient and even our practice staff are triaging calls to help the smooth and speedy delivery of services. We also have new team members, like physios, social workers, pharmacists and mental health workers. It is vital that you are connected to the correct team member to sort out your problem. googletag.cmd.push The reception staff may ask details regarding the problem to help this process. Practices are still asking people to attend the surgery for tests or examination and to avoid unnecessary trips or exposure we are also using things like video consults. Despite the talk about the ending of lockdown, COVID- is not ending. It is still there and will spread unless we continue to take precautions. This means we cannot have waiting rooms full of patients and allow someone to land in with symptoms and possibly infect a whole waiting room. If you attend the surgery you will be asked to wear a mask. It remains good practice to wash your hands regularly and wear a maskout. Despite the end of lock down, high risk patients remain high risk, and while the government restrictions do not apply, personallyI had been shielding I would continue to limit my contact with crowds during to the risk of infection. We do not have a vaccine yet, and according to figures we are nowhere near herd immunity levels, so any thoughts that COVID- is over are premature. This explains why GPs cannot go back to how things were pre-COVID and may not be able to for some time.We thank the public for their support in this.“ Dr Paul Molloy Western LMC Secretary.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In April of this year Debenhams announced that administrators had been appointed to protect the business. It aimed to open as many stores as possible once Coronavirus restrictions were lted. However, the company said that it would liquidate all  stores in the Republic of Ireland and they were not expected to reopen. More than , Debenhams workers in Ireland were notied that they’d lost their jobs. The Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin said the company has treated its Irish workers in a very shabby way in depriving them of redundancy entitlements and he believes the law must be re-examined. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside store reopened once permitted to do so by the government. Today, the Derry News asked Debenhams the long-term future of the store in Derry has been secured at this stage and whether it expects any jobs to be lost due to the COVID- crisis. In response a spokesperson simply said there have been no updates since the store reopened. At the weekend, Debenhams workers from as far afield as Cork protested outside the Debenhams store on Foyle Street in Derry to make consumers aware of what they described as their employer’s despicable actions. However, Mandate Trade Union says the company didn’t set aside finances to pay the workers their agreed redundancy package, having transferred valuable assets to the UK parent company. googletag.cmd.push Valerie Conlon who worked in the Debenhams store on Patrick Street in Cork for  years said: “We are not going to let this company just walk away and not pay. We’ve given decades of service and helped make huge profits for Debenhams so for them to just abandon their responsibilities is a disgrace.” She added: “We will be making everyone aware of how Debenhams treats its workers, andthat means traveling six hours to Derry, so be it. If they can do this to us and get away with it, how do we know it won’t be the workers in Derry next ” John Douglas, Mandate General Secretary said: “I have to commend these workers for standing up and fighting back against their despicable treatment. They’ve travelled to Belfast, they’ve protested outside the Dail, they’ve stood on picket lines all across the country and they’re not going to back down. “These workers have a combined service of over , years. They deserve a satisfactory resolution to this dispute and the company knows what it needs to do. Pay the workers the redundancy they are owed. If they don’t, Mandate Trade Union will continue to support the workers as they campaign for justice.” Niall McCarroll of Derry Trades Union Councilrecalled Clery’s Department store in Dublin closing in  leaving nearly  workers out in the cold, with no redundancy package. Fast forward to  and another  workers face the same situation as Debenhams retail Ireland closing  stores. Retail workers will face growing uncertainty over jobs as we attempt to come out the other end of COVID-. DTUC encourages all retail workers in the city to get organised, join a trade union and begin to strengthen the resistance against the self interests of big business. The demand to strengthen workers rights through more effect legal frameworks must also be met. In the meantime it is imperative everyone stands with the Debenhams workers, in their fight for a decent redundancy package and to be treated with respect and dignity.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Now, at the age of , the well-known Derry man has finally done it. Over the last couple of years, Paddy has been writing his memoirs and, from next week, the Derry News will be publishing extracts of his ,-word story. It is a fascinating story which takes in many aspects of his le, from growing up during World War  to running a business in Derrys city centre throughout the Troubles for  years. However, his working le is only part of Paddys story. After retiring, he embraced a love of learning and graduated with a degree in Irish History and Politics from the University of Ulster at the age of . googletag.cmd.push He admits that he was like a grandfather figure to his young fellow students. He continues to enjoy reading and learning about a host of subjects, particularly history. He is a man who likes to keep busy. “I did not want to retire and spend all day sitting in a chair zapping at the TV,” he said. As a result, the last couple of years have been spent working on his memoirs. Paddy was born in  at  Lone Moor Road, the fourth of eight children born to James and Mary McCaul. Paddy admitted that it had been emotional in writing about his parents. googletag.cmd.push “It was only when I was older that I appreciated how good and hardworking people they were,” he said. “My father would have worked all he could to provide for his family and my mother did everything to make sure that her children were fed and looked after. “I have such admiration for my parents but they were people of their time and thats how things were then.” After leaving school, Paddy worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway and the City Surveyors Department in Derry. He started employement as a salesman with electrical appliance company Electrolux in . Through relationships built up in this job, he opened his own shop, McCaul Appliances at John Street in . Within a few years, John Street and the rest of the city centre was targeted regularly as part of the IRA bombing campaign. Paddys shop did not escape. In his memoirs, he recalls on one occasion being held at gunpoint as a bomb was planted in the store. He recalls: “My main focus was not on what was obviously some sort of device but on the shaking hand which held the rather ancient-looking hand gun.” McCauls Appliances relocated for a time to the Waterside, before finding a new base at Quayside Shopping Centre where the store remained until Paddy retired in . However, as already stated, Paddy was not keen on taking things easy during retirement. “I always like to keep active and did not want to end up doing nothing when I retired,” he said. He signed up for a Diploma in Foundation Studies for mature students at the University of Ulsters Magee campus in . He is in no doubt about the impact this had. “That course changed my le,” said Paddy. “I had always been interested in reading since I was a young boy and had enjoyed my time at school. “However, coming from a working class family, the focus was always on getting out of school and finding work so you could start contributing to the family. “So it was great to get the chance to indulge my interest in learning at that later stage of my le.” Paddy said he gained a new lease of le mixing with his young student colleagues and is a big advocate of the importance of education. Despite being in his th year, the Derry man keeps himself active with daily walks along the citys quayside. In his long and eventful le, he has seen many changes, some good, some not so good, in his home town. It is a place he is very proud of and very proud to come from. Whilst acknowledging that he would have been well known in Derry, especially through his involvement in business for many years, Paddy describes himself as just an ordinary Derry man. He says he hopes people enjoy reading the story of his le. He insists it is just the story of an ordinary man. Often, those are the best type of stories.

This sweet and gentle dog was stray for quite some time and covered over  miles on his travels, carrying on even after he was hit by a car. Thankfully, he was brought to Friends of Rescue who gave him a full MOT before nursing him back to health in foster care. Now Miles is looking for a home to call his own, with a very secure garden. We were tracking Miles for over a week and there were sightings of him all over the place, said Friends of Rescue founder, Suzanna Flemming. googletag.cmd.push He was on the run and losing weight quite rapidly. He was hit by a car and still kept running. Thankfully he had no broken bones and was just a little stf and sore, but he had a lot of scarring on his body new and old. After a well deserved bubble bath he was wormed and flead and we got him into foster care and got him fattened up a little bit and neutered, chipped and vaccinated. Miles is a special dog and will need a special home. He is doing his very best in foster but he is still a very nervous man and he will need time, reassurance and most of all patience, said Ms Flemming. googletag.cmd.push Miles would benefit from another dog or dogs in the household but no young children, and this is purely down to his nervousness. And hell obviously need an extra secure garden so that he doesn’t ‘try a Miles’ again He will make an amazing family member. He is sweet, gentle and forgiving. Friends of Rescue had to close its doors due to lockdown but since lockdown has eased it has  dogs and  cats in its care. We have been very busy since the travel restrictions eased, whether this is down to people going back to work, we dont know, said Ms Flemming. The charity started as a rehoming blog around two and half years ago but one dog turned into five and it became a rehoming charity. Friends of Rescue now has six or seven foster families who look after rescued animals while they are treated at the vets and assessed for what type of family would suit them. If you would like to offer Miles a loving home or find out more about the charity you can visit the Friends of Rescue Facebook page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The governing body for ladies’ football in Derry announced details of the tournament last week and Secretary Teresa McKenna said it was only right to remember a ‘great ambassador’. “During  lockdown, Derry lost a great ambassador for our beloved sport, a player who embodied everything which is to be celebrated about ladies’ football,” she said. “The Derry LGFA Executive felt it was only fitting that we would celebrate Seonaidh’s le and influence on the game of Ladies football over many years by dedicating this special event to her memory. googletag.cmd.push “Derry LGFA are delighted that Seonaidh’s family and club have given their blessing to our request and we look forward to welcoming all our clubs back out to competitive football with this very special event.” Seonaidh Mullan lost her battle with leukaemia in April  after a brave thirteen-month fight and the Carnabhal is an opportunity for the Derry LGFA community to pay tribute to her. A mainstay in the Ballerin team, Seonaidh had played for the team since it was formed in , right up until her illness took hold last year. She dedicated a lot of time to coaching the underage ranks and became a driving force behind the growth of the sport within the club. googletag.cmd.push Seonaidh’s husband, Stephen, said the family were proud to see the Carnabhal na Peile dedicated to her memory. “Seonaidh spent many happy years playing and coaching and, even during her illness, she attended matches and was interested in what was going on within her club and county,” he said. “We are really pleased and proud that the Carnabhal na Peile will be dedicated in Seonaidhs memory and on behalf of myself, our children, Oisiacuten and Uacutena, and all of our family, I would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for this very thoughtful gesture. Ballerin LGFC Secretary, Ursula McKillop, said the club were delighted the county board had chosen this way of celebrating Seonaidh’s le. “Alongside the many years of playing ladies football for Ballerin, Seonaidh was also our club chairperson for several years and spent many hours at the pitch coaching our underage teams,” she said. “It is very fitting that her memory is being recognised in this way. Ive no doubt she will be smiling down on us all as we take to the fields again in a few weeks’ time. “Our club would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for remembering Seonaidh in this special way and look forward to taking part in what will be a very special Carnabhal for Seonaidhs family, friends and wider GAA family.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The governing body for ladies’ football in Derry announced details of the tournament last week and Secretary Teresa McKenna said it was only right to remember a ‘great ambassador’. “During  lockdown, Derry lost a great ambassador for our beloved sport, a player who embodied everything which is to be celebrated about ladies’ football,” she said. “The Derry LGFA Executive felt it was only fitting that we would celebrate Seonaidh’s le and influence on the game of Ladies football over many years by dedicating this special event to her memory. googletag.cmd.push “Derry LGFA are delighted that Seonaidh’s family and club have given their blessing to our request and we look forward to welcoming all our clubs back out to competitive football with this very special event.” Seonaidh Mullan lost her battle with leukaemia in April  after a brave thirteen-month fight and the Carnabhal is an opportunity for the Derry LGFA community to pay tribute to her. A mainstay in the Ballerin team, Seonaidh had played for the team since it was formed in , right up until her illness took hold last year. She dedicated a lot of time to coaching the underage ranks and became a driving force behind the growth of the sport within the club. googletag.cmd.push Seonaidh’s husband, Stephen, said the family were proud to see the Carnabhal na Peile dedicated to her memory. “Seonaidh spent many happy years playing and coaching and, even during her illness, she attended matches and was interested in what was going on within her club and county,” he said. “We are really pleased and proud that the Carnabhal na Peile will be dedicated in Seonaidhs memory and on behalf of myself, our children, Oisiacuten and Uacutena, and all of our family, I would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for this very thoughtful gesture. Ballerin LGFC Secretary, Ursula McKillop, said the club were delighted the county board had chosen this way of celebrating Seonaidh’s le. “Alongside the many years of playing ladies football for Ballerin, Seonaidh was also our club chairperson for several years and spent many hours at the pitch coaching our underage teams,” she said. “It is very fitting that her memory is being recognised in this way. Ive no doubt she will be smiling down on us all as we take to the fields again in a few weeks’ time. “Our club would like to thank Derry Ladies County Board for remembering Seonaidh in this special way and look forward to taking part in what will be a very special Carnabhal for Seonaidhs family, friends and wider GAA family.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There will be no official Orange Order parades after the organisation announced their cancellation earlier this year. Grand Secretary of the Orange Order, Mervyn Gibson, urged people to stay at home, while the Order have launched a ‘Twelfth at Home’ campaign to urge people to celebrate safely. “This year the Twelfth is about everyone’s health. You have to understand why we cancelled the parades. Parades attract large crowds,” he said. “Bandsmen will simply be going into a village or an estate or a street and playing some music. googletag.cmd.push “We would be saying to everyone to stay at your door, stay in your garden, listen to them and enjoy, butyou see a band, please don’t follow them.” The Parades Commission list for July  includes parades in Maghera, Moneymore, Limavady, Garvagh, Articlave, Tobermore and Magherafelt. Two separate bands will parade in Coleraine, Castledawson and Macosquin, but none will take place simultaneously. Numbers of participants have been capped at , with ten of the thirteen bands applying for the maximum amount, while all but one list the number of planned supporters as . The exception is in Magherafelt, where the Ballymoughan Purple Guards Flute Band have specied an ‘unknown’ number of supporters will be attending the parade. googletag.cmd.push Maghera Sons of William Flute Band said no members of their local Orange Lodge would be parading with the band. “No members of MSOW LOL will be on parade with the band,” they said in a post on their Facebook page. “Social distancing protocol will be followed, and we ask members of the public not to gather around the area of the Orange Hall. “The route is the longest we can do, taking in the majority of the town. We encourage you to stay in your gardens and enjoy the time with your family as the band passes by.” The Ulster Bands Forum, an online  for marching bands, have issued a plea for supporters to protect themselves and the bands. “Bands are going to a lot of effort for you, please afford them the same respect and support,” they said. “Dont follow the band, they will make every effort to come to you. Do not travel outside your local area to see bands. “If you need to use a car to see your local band, stay inside and park safely. Observe social distancing measures at all times. Dont invite all and sundry to your garden. “Lets hold our heads high after this and be able to say we respected and observed our culture whilst staying within the law,” the statement concluded. Mid Ulster District Councillor Paul McLean said the bands have made it clear that everyone should obey safety guidelines. The DUP group on Mid Ulster Council believe bands that have organised such events are clear that they wish everyone to abide by the social distancing regulations and guidelines, he said. They will bring the Twelfth to the community who they ask remain in their homes and gardens and not to participate in the parade.I welcome the bands’ commitment to celebrate proudly and safely and I would ask everyone to do as they have asked. Abiding by the regulations and guidelines ensures our friends, our familIes and our neighbours are protected and demonstrates the ongoing commitment to our NHS.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dara McNicholl, from Moneyneena, wowed the judges with a stirring rendition of Whitney Houston’s ‘I Have Nothing’. The Moneyneena native made his singing bow in a school play, but his modesty meant his teacher had to ring and let his parents know. “I’ve only really been singing properly for about three years,” he told viewers in the run-up to his performance. ”I just used to hum, but secretly I’d go out into the car and sing along to the radio. Getting on the stage and looking at the amount of people staring at you is much dferent to being in the car. googletag.cmd.push ”Hopefully I have what it takes to make one of the coaches turn around.”  Dara’s parents, Donna and Chris watch on proudly from the wings. In the end, proud parents Donna and Chris watched from the wings with host Emma Willis as all four judges stood up and took notice. Will. I. Am and Danny Jones spun in their seats immediately and it didn’t take long for Paloma Faith and Pixie Lott to follow suit. “You didn’t miss a note, it was crystal-clear. I was blown away by your voice and it gave me goosebumps,” said Paloma Faith afterwards. “I’m actually lost for words, because I feel like I’m in the presence of something really special. I don’t think you realise how good you are,” added Danny Jones. googletag.cmd.push Producer Will.I.Am told Dara he hoped to bring out the best in his abilities, while Pixie Lott said she like the idea of instilling confidence in him as the show progressed. In the end, the St Colm’s Ballinascreen U hurler opted for Team Paloma to take him forward in the competition.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Magnicent Seven Crew is a project made up of singers and musicians from Derry, Dungiven and Sligo. They recently joined forces to help Foyle Foodbank with their role of providing food for those who are experiencing food poverty. The entertainment industry has been hit hard as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. With pubs closed, many singers and musicians lost their main source of income overnight. However, many local entertainment figures have been involved in fundraising initiatives during the lockdown. The Magnicent Seven Crew project was coordinated by local musician Leo Fitzpatrick who through his vision, enthusiasm, talent and commitment managed to achieve their target of pound, for the local foodbank. googletag.cmd.push The project saw up to  entertainers perform from home and encourage donations from those who tuned in nightly to see them. The Magnicent Seven Crew project went live on Facebook on Friday, May , and within eight weeks had achieved its target. Speaking on behalf of the Board Of Directors and volunteers at the Foyle Foodbank, Damien McAdams praised everyone involved in the recent fundraiser. “Night after night the entertainers give freely of their time and talent to produce a series of excellent performances,” he said. “Some of the performers it should be noted have lost their main source of income as a result of this pandemic and some are dealing with their own dficult health issues yet they have been determined in their willingness to help those most in need. googletag.cmd.push “The generosity of the Derry public and further afield has been amazing. “Its important to point out that all of the performers performed free of charge and all donations went to the Foyle Foodbank.” Mr McAdams added: “We would like to take this opportunity to thank all those singers, musicians and Leo Fitzpatrick for their magnicent achievement. “We also wish to acknowledge the great generosity of all those who donated in any way to the Foyle Foodbank.” The Foyle Foodbank says it has seen a sharp increase in demand for help during the lockdown period.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like many others, the  year-old Derry driver has had to wait later than planned to get his season underway with events being rescheduled due to the Covid- pandemic. Rally di Roma Capitale in Italy will now open the series next week. Having shaken the establishment on his R debut at this level on Rally Hungary last year where he took a podium finish, Devine is determined to show that that resultwasn’t a once off. “We’re really looking forward to this event”, said Devine. “Obviously it’s been quite a wait to get out competitivelyagain so little things like getting a test in the car last week and unveiling the livery all add to the build up morethan usual. The car looks great and I’m extremely thankful to all our partners. googletag.cmd.push We showed inHungary last year some of what we are capable of but this will be a very dferent challenge with a very strong entry. With a curtailed championship too it means more than ever we’ll have to on it from the word go.” Devine’s involvement with the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy and Hyundai’s Junior Driverprograms has kept him busy over the last number of months as the start of the season was delayed. “Being involved in those initiatives has been a great help at keeping focused over the last while andwill hopefully stand to me when we cross the start line”, Callum said. “At this level it can be thosesmall things that make the dference. Hyundai have also carried out a lot of development on the iR too and that will be great, not just for me, but for the competitiveness of the championship.” googletag.cmd.push Callum as usual, will be partnered by Brian Hoy and the Hyundai will be run by Irish rally preparation firm, PCRS. The all Irish team will also be entered officially under the Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy banner making them eligible to score points in the ERC Teams Championship too. However,it’s another championship that Callum is eyeing up. “The ERC Junior Championship is undoubtedlyour focus this season because of the prize fund on offer, there aren’t many prizes like that in rallying.” Rally di Roma Capitale will begin on Friday, July  with pre-event practice and shakedown before the event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event. The competitive mileage of the event will come in at just under km which and the event is operating a very strict Covid- policy, with restrictions on spectators as well as all registered personnel.

Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane. All updates relating to services and reopening will be communicated directly to members and on the ious social media s over the summer and on the website atwww.derrystrabane leisure.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Members of Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Health and Communities Committee last week approved a reopening plan and subject to elected members’ approval at Full Council later this month, details of our reopening dates will be confirmed. googletag.cmd.push A spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council reassured the public that extensive work is taking place at leisure facilities across the Council to welcome the public back to its centres and sports facilities. “It is important to note that Council has to work within the NI Executive’s COVID- guidelines and our staff are workingbehind the scenes to ensure everything is in place to ensure safe workout areas, hygiene and booking facilities whilst maintaining our high standards of service. “Our priority will be to reopen our tier one centres at Foyle Arena and Templemore Sports Complex in Derry, the Riversdale Leisure Centre in Strabane and the Derg Valley Leisure Centre in Castlederg in the first instance. We are currently looking at options and safe working practices to facilitate this over the coming weeks. “We anticipate that when we do reopen, it will be with limited capacity, primarily for gym and fitness classes only and with reduced numbers of people. Bookings will need to be made in advance. Some outdoor pitches and courts are currently available for club hire only at this stage and we anticipate that it will be some time yet before we can expand our services to offer swimming and other activities.” The Council spokesperson said that as part of its planning for its phased reopening it will be embarking on a marketing campaign to provide advice, information and reassurance to the public. The public have also been advised that while sports pavilions and pitches remain closed to the public, a booking system is in place to facilitate some outdoor recreation facilities for sports clubs and sporting organisations for training purposes only. The Council has been working proactively with clubs and user groups on this over the past number of weeks and bookings are now being taken. Clubs looking for more information and keen to book the outdoor pitches are urged to fill out an online form Sports clubs can request a booking by sending a booking application form and all required supporting documentation tosportsdevelopment@derrystrabane. “This has been a very challenging time for our leisure centre users and members and we appreciate their patience and understanding at this time. We want to reassure you that the health and safety of the public and our staff are our prime concern and as we plan our phased reopening, it will require their continued patience and co-operation.” Anyone who has any queries regarding their leisure membership are urged to emailmemberships@derrystrabane. All updates relating to services and reopening will be communicated directly to members and on the ious social media s over the summer and on the website atwww.derrystrabane leisure.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are also crew quarters for up to ten staff.The dining table can accommodate up to  guests and there is a separate bar and lounge areas.It even has its own inflatable flying boat and other toys include sailing dinghies, speedboats, ing gear and fishing gear, and lots more tucked away in its cavernous lockers.Athos spent several days at anchor in Strangford Lough last week and her presence certainly generated plenty of local interest,not from offers to purchase.She is on a long term charter and is currently cruising up the west coast of Scotland.Among the crew members is  year-old Melissa Ramm, from Donaghadee, who works as a deck hand.Her mum, Margaret, was lucky enough to get on board when Athos pulled into Antigua in the WestIndies back in March just before the Covid lockdown.ldquoItrsquos a stunningly elegant yacht, said Margaret. ldquoI would certainly have no problem living on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Book deals usually don’t happen to people like me  ","story":"NOTED for her flair for writing fantasy novels, a Ballynahinch woman is now turning her hand to crime stories after signing a rolling contract with a leading UK publisher recently.Kerry Buchanan, whose award-winning short stories and science fiction books have also been well received by the industries critics, is still in disbelief that her writing career is going so well.Kerry, who lives with her husband, Fraser, and their three grown-up children, Katrina , Lauraand Patrick , is also a full time carer to her  year-old father, Harold Matthews.Kerry, who only began writing shortly before she turned , says their family farm provides a lot of inspiration much welcomed escapism writing.Her crime novels - the Harvey and Birch series ndash will be coming to Amazon in the next few months.Since signing the initial three-book deal with Joffe Books, Kerry says that she feels blessed.ldquoWhen I wake up every morning, I go through the usual check list mdash arms check, legs check, book deal. Book deals usually donrsquot happen to people like me, she jokes.ldquoJoffe were the only publisher I sent my manus to. I was a fan of several of their authors already and I like the way they work with their writers to help them produce their best work.Kerry, who is originally from Yorkshire, settled very easily amid some of Co Downrsquos finest vistas when she married almost three decades ago. She describes how her writing career came about.ldquoI was always a bit of a daddyrsquos girl, so when my father was diagnosed with Alzheimers in , I felt I needed to find an outlet to escape to for some consolation between visits back home. That acted as the trigger.ldquoWhen my mother died a few years later, I brought my father over to live with us and he has since settled in well.ldquoWe are surrounded by horses, hens, dogs, cats, lizards and a few snakes. Maybe not you average farm animals, but we do have stunning views of rolling drumlins, forests and two beautul lakes.ldquoI feel there is an inspirational current with the weather in this part of Co Down. I love it here. Itrsquos a lot like where I grew up.She continued: ldquoI soon set up a make sht work space at the kitchen table, which wasnrsquot the most comfortable but a little of our homemade blackberry brandy helped fuel the senses.ldquoI borrowed my husbandrsquos iPad and after six weeks and some , words later I had completed my first novel.ldquoI never published that one, or the few books that flowed from it. I felt I was just limbering up to a career in writing, cutting my teeth and learning with each page.ldquoWith the books that followed, I grew in confidence and delivery until I felt I could begin to publish them.Kerryrsquos first stories were historical fantasy which she enjoyed working on tremendously, so much so that as more fiction followed, so did the acclaim.She said: ldquoIrsquove been lucky enough to win an ACNI SIAP award in  and then a second ACNI award earlier this year. A short story I wrote called The Armada Tree,won Kraxon Magazinersquos Story of the Year Award.ldquoI am lucky enough to belong to some brilliant writing groups, not least the Hexmen, the Yellow Door Group, and the Belfast Writers Group. Without them, Irsquod still be typing away in a vacuum. They are great people and include some successful writers who have freely shared their knowledge and experience.Kerry has packed a lot of living and experience into her le mdash shersquos worked as a veterinary surgeon, scienticresearcher, computer studies teacher and stable hand.ldquoIrsquove had plenty of le experience to draw upon and inspire me, she said. ldquoSometimes I give talks for NI Libraries to groups of budding writers eager to learn the basics and I often read my work at these events too. I love being able to do this. Itrsquos a way of giving something back for all the terric guidance and knowledge I gained while I was an amateur.ldquoI was so fortunate to have science fiction writer Jo Zebedee take me under her wing at the beginning.

Brexit.jpg","title":"Clampdown on speeding  ","story":"A MAJOR new offensive is being waged on drivers who break the law at a number of the districtrsquos speeding hot spots.Speed indicator signs which inform drivers about their speed are to be erected in Downpatrick, Newcastle, Killyleagh and Castlewellan by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership.The signs are to be erected at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick, Newcastlersquos South Promenade, Castlewellanrsquos Dublin Road and the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh.A total of seven signs will be erected shortly across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area as part of the major clampdown on speeders.The move has been welcomed by a number of local councillors including Dermot Curran, Willie Clarke, Billy Walker, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor who say that the new signs have the potential to save lives by encouraging drivers to slow down in what are heavily populated areas.Cllr Curran said that drivers regularly ignored the mph zone along a large stretch of the Strangford Road.ldquoThis area is densely populated and there are always people walking at this part of the town. A number of accidents at this location have been blamed on speeding, with residents highlighting their concerns about the issue for some considerable time, he continued.ldquoThere is a clear and obvious need for the authorities to get to grips with the speeding problem and the PCSP deserves praise for this initiative. Unfortunately, many drivers think a large part of the Strangford Road is governed by a mph limit which is not case. Residents I have spoken to about the problem say the speed of some vehicles is frightening to say the least.Cllr Curran said that were many housing developments accessed via the Strangford Road which carries a high volume of pedestrian traffic.He added: ldquoWhile welcoming the speed indicator sign, I believe there is a need to move the mph limit back beyond the former Down Council headquarters. Speeders need to slow down before someone is killed.Cllr Sharvin believes one of the real benefits of the announcement is that it has ldquokick-started and energised a conversation among the public about other hot spots for speeding.He added: ldquoI recognise that these signs are an expensive investment but, ultimately, the success of them will be measured in how the public respond to them. If we can begin to see speeds lowered across the district and lives potentially saved, the scheme will have been a success.Cllr Trainor said he hopes the new signs will raise further awareness in driversrsquo minds on the need to reduce their speed along these stretches of road.He added: ldquoWe know that the Strangford Road is a hotspot for speeding traffic and the dangers associated with this. If the new signs reduce speed and help save lives they will be worthwhile, but but road safety is everyonersquos concern.Cllr Clarke said he is ldquodelighted that one of the new signs will be placed at Newcastlersquos South Promenade which carries a huge volume of traffic.He said news of the speed indicator sign will be welcomed be residents who live at this part of the resort and the many pedestrians who walk in the area will be encouraged by the initiative.ldquoI hope that the sign will go some way towards tackling the issue of speeding at this busy part of Newcastle, he said.ldquoThis is a welcome move and something that Sinn Feacutein has been lobbying for over many years to protect residents who live at this part of the resort. The speed sign will also hopefully make South Promenade safer for pedestrians.Cllr Clarke said the PCSP is committed to improving road safety across the district and will continue to work with local communities and local police to make this happen.The Mournes councillor also welcomed the provision of a speed sign at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan which is a main link to a number of towns and villages and carries a high volume of traffic.Welcoming the presence of a new speed sign at the Shrigley Road in Killyleagh, Cllr Walker said that he hopes drivers get the message and slow down.ldquoMany people walk along this particular road and it is vital that everything is done to keep them safe. I hope that thew new sign will act as a deterrent and drivers will ease off the accelerator, he continued.He added: ldquoThe PCSP deserves credit for listening to the concerns of elected representatives and the wider public on the speeding issue. The message must go out that speeders are placing their lives and those of other road users in danger.

He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work and needs financial help.Mr Gardiner also said the railway is likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid- and the specic challenges the organisation faces with its trains, infrastructure and operations.ldquoWith no income for the rest of the year, we will face major challenges keeping the railway maintained and ensuring our vital work on our carriages, locomotives, track and stations can continue, he explained.ldquoOur final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont have failed, so now we reluctantly must turn to our members and supporters to ask for help. We need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.Mr Gardiner said he could not see now to resume train operations this year in a way that will be safe and, at the same time, not compound the organisationrsquos financial situation by operating trains at a loss.Mr Gardiner said the railway supported the governmentrsquos call for a total lockdown of activities in the fight against Covid-.Even so, he said the lockdown had a ldquomassive hit hit on the railwayrsquos finances, leaving it struggling to keep ready to reopen when it is safe to do so.ldquoWe have just under pound, of bills to pay this year in essential, unavoidable costs alone, to keep the business in mothballs, Mr Gardiner revealed.ldquoWe have been paying these through our savings which were built up over the past few years but were meant for long-awaited essential maintenance, critical repair and restoration work to safeguard the railwayrsquos long term future.ldquoWe have watched as heritage railways across the UK and Ireland launched fundraising campaigns but, at a time when people were worried about basics such as paying their bills, buying groceries and had worries about their jobs and the health of their families, we felt that it just wasnrsquot right to ask for money for a steam railway, so we tried many other avenues of funding.ldquoOur final hope for funding from Stormont was an application for pound, to the Covid- Charities Fund to cover the day-to-day essential costs we have already accrued to date, but we learnt within days of the application being made that it had been rejected.ldquoThis was our last chance with the government schemes as we did not qualy for funding under either the pound, or pound, business support schemes, designed specically for the tourism and hospitality industry as our rateable value was pound, over the pound, threshold. We were also not eligible for the Micro Business Hardship Fund, the Sports and Clubs or voluntary and community sector hardship funds.The chairman continued: ldquoIn short, we have been rejected for support every time because we were too small, too large, or missing a financial threshold by only a few pounds.ldquoSometimes we miss out because we have a small cash reserve for those vital projects, a reserve which is also made up of legacy donations from benefactors who have passed away and wished their donations to go to landmark projects rather than pay day-to-day bills.Mr Gardiner said the heritage railwayrsquos only public funding was what he described as a ldquomodest grant from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and that a question mark hung over this yearrsquos funding.He added: ldquoWe must thank those MLAs, councillors and public representatives who have lobbied and argued our case, even mentioning us in correspondence with NI Executive ministers as an example of an organisation that appears to have fallen through the cracks.ldquoMany of us within the Downpatrick and Co Down Railway feel deep disappointment and frustration, as it feels like every door we try to open is either locked or closed on us. It also feels like, as a business, we are being penalised for good financial governance.Anyone interested in making a financial donation is asked to visit the heritage railwayrsquos website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th July 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Hopes for restoration of Shrigley clock for its 150th anniversary  ","story":"DETAILS of fresh efforts to restore a historic clock which was once the centrepiece of village le in Shrigley have been unveiled.The iconic Martin Memorial clock, which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage, celebrates its th anniversary next year.To mark the occasion, Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews is hoping that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Housing Executive will join forces to help put the tick back in the famous clock.He says it is sad to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair and hopes efforts to restore it will be successful to preserve it for generations to come.Designed in  by Timothy Hevey, the clock is constructed of brown stone in three layers, with the base surrounded by iron railings. Originally, there was an elaborate lamp at each corner and also a drinking fountain.While there have been ious meetings over many years to discuss the restoration of the clock, nothing ever happened, something Cllr Andrews hopes that he can help put right.He says while money is tight for many organisations which had to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, he hopes the local council and housing officials will commit to helping restore the famous clock to provide a reminder to current generations of Shrigleyrsquos industrial past.The village was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill has long gone mdash it is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Cllr Andrews believes that residents in Shrigley, Killyleagh and further afield would like to see the clock restored to its former glory and hopes he can secure agreement in principle for this to happen.ldquoWe canrsquot allow the clock to deteriorate further, he declared. ldquoIt is an integral part of Shrigleyrsquos history and it must be preserved.ldquoIn the past it was suggested that a community garden could be developed alongside the clock and perhaps that is something worth pursuing.ldquoI think it is incumbent upon those who can help restore the clock to step forward and perhaps the restoration project is something that the Department for Communities could also lend its support to, given the clockrsquos historic link with the former mill located nearby.Cllr Andrews said that identying funds to finance any restoration work was vital in moving forward, also highlighting the need for an agreed plan to maintain the clock.ldquoThe Martin Memorial clock is at the heart of Shrigleyrsquos history and culture and it must not be lost. It must be preserved and those who can help achieve this must come forward, he continued.ldquoGiven its history, a restored clock could become an attraction for visitors and people researching the arearsquos past.ldquoI hope that I can help harness interest and willingness in number of agencies to weigh in behind a successful regeneration project in the heart of Shrigley.

It turned out it was a good deion!Our motto for the walk, lsquoBe Amazed!rsquo, was inspired by Patrickrsquos Confession in which he recounts his journey to Ireland as a fth century slave before being freed spiritually and physically by God. To be honest I was amazed all seven wanted to do the whole Downpatrick Camino in one day as, for many people, I would recommend two half days. It is not for the faint-hearted!Welcoming everyone, I pointed out the finish time was between pm and pm and the Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, kindly turned up to bless us on our way, leading us in the pilgrim prayer, which is found in the new pilgrim passport.ldquoI arise today through Godrsquos strength to pilot me, Godrsquos might to uphold mehellipThe newly produced Pilgrim Passport was to stamped at each point along the way: Saint Patrick Centre, Inch Abbey, Saul Church, Slieve Patrick, Struell Wells, St Patrickrsquos Memorial Church, Downpatrick and St Patrickrsquos Grave.ldquoA wing and a prayer, was how one pilgrim put it.Our journey would usually begin at the Saint Patrick Centrersquos IMAX film which explores the story of Patrick but due to lockdown restrictions we skipped this part and, instead, there was a quick photo-call with the new high viz jackets, sponsored by Phoenix Gas.It was an eclectic group: the aptly-named Hillary who had climbed Tanzaniarsquos Kilimanjaro and another, a journalist, who planned to write about the Way a mother and son with strong links to Downpatrick a married couple, Jim and Marion, from Belfast, who were around retirement age and had walked the Camino de Santiago in Spain and finally their friend, Colette, a casual walker blessed with great faith, a sharp wit and, I recall, a fancy gadget that calculated distance.We set out, climbing St Patrickrsquos Staircase and were headed towards Down Museum when a pilgrim asked me about the building behind us.That panicky feeling from school days when my teacher asked an unexpected question began to rise. My credibility as a guide was at stake. Thankfully I had looked up the school out of curiosity the night before. ldquoOh yes, that school was built about  years ago by the Southwell familyhellipIt seemed to get easier after that as we walked towards the Mound of Down to hear about John de Courcy before marching through the fields towards Inch. We would have to take the Belfast Road, as my dream of having a bridge, or a boat, to cross the Quoile was still a dream.At least the grass was freshly cut and the weather was dry. The Lord was good to us.During the tour at Inch Abbey we met a local man, Roger, who kindly pointed out some little known facts and features including the early ldquospa hot-tub where the monkrsquos infirmary had once stood on the banks of the Quoile.After a break, we set off for the banks of the Quoile River and Saul Hill, the group happily chatting to one another after a lockdown of three and a half months. The Quoile is a gentle part of the walk and as the river flowed, ducklings were paddling behind their mother, like pilgrims on the Way.The Mearne Road was a bit more challenging as the way got steeper but we knew Patrick himself had made this climb on his route to founding the first church on the island. Before long we could see the round tower and had made it in good time, around :pm. A trinity was there to greet us mdash the Centre Director Dr Tim Campbell, pilgrim guide Elaine Kelly and the Dean of Down, who recounted the history of Saul Church.When we arrived at The Barn at Saul, just yards away, we were all ready for the pilgrim welcome, the pilgrim washroom and the pilgrim lunch mdash soup and sandwiches, tea and coffee with carefully observed social distancing.They were a happy bunch as I bade them farewell and offered a lt back to anyone who wanted it. But all agreed they wanted to continue with Elaine to Slieve Patrick and then on to Struell Wells via the Lecale path, what I had dubbed the Way of Tranquility until I fell flat on my face in the mud, going over a stile the week before.Hours later, back at the centre, we waited for the pilgrims to . Around pm a message came through that the mother and son had to leave for an appointment and one of the walkers had hit her wall just before the ancient ones at Struell Wells. I put the kettle on and was relieved to see Colette, the walker from Ballymurphy, coming towards the centre, half an hour later.She was exhausted but in good humour as she regaled us with her observations, including the need for a toilet at Struell Wells. ldquoPilgrimrsquos Pain, she declared, and jokedthat she had less suffering during the Troubles in Ballymurphy.Slumped in her chair with her tea at the St Patrickrsquos Centre, having completed % of the walk, she insisted that the Way was way more than  miles . She referred to a fancy gadget ndash which actually turned out to be accurate. Our five-mile estimate for the morning was closer to six miles and the afternoon closer to ten. So a sweet  miles altogether. What would the other pilgrims say when they got back Like an expectant mother and father, Dr Tim Campbell and I waited. I was looking at my watch and nervously flicking at the kettle switch until we caught the reflection of the high-vis jackets in one of the shop windows. Teas were hurried made as the pilgrims, led by Elaine, looking like Rocky Balboa, triumphantly made their way towards the centre.ldquoIt was an amazing experience, declared the journalist who later said he had the energy to walk his love and woke up feeling refreshed. He loved it! Hillaryrsquos boots which had mounted Kilimanjaro started to fall apart on Slieve Patrick but she was rejoicing.The husband and we team from Belfast  ldquoAstounding, exclaimed Marion, joyfully, exhausted but glad to have made it. ldquoYou just need to tell people itrsquos longer, said her husband, Jim.The next dayrsquos pilgrimage, with a few adjustments, had everyone back at .pm.And Elaine and I received some lovely messages including one from Colette, graciously thanking us. ldquoWalking with you on St Patrickrsquos Way. It was an experience I wouldnrsquot have missed.We have  fully booked for July . Thank God! I was afraid I would have to move to Bangor to promote Columbanus.Martina Purdy, a former BBC correspondent and Adoration Sister, is now a pilgrim guide and public relations consultant for the St Patrick Centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th July 2020 Go Digital.jpg","title":"Ruairi signs deal with The Ports  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN striker Ruairi Croskery has signed for newly promoted Dankse Bank Premiership side Portadown.The  year-old has signed a two year contract at Shamrock Park ahead of the - season.Croskery spent four years at Manchester United and featured in the same Un- squad as current first team stars Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay.After his spell at Old Trafford he ed back to Northern Ireland to sign for Linfield.

I was born early on a September morning in  in the County Hospital in Enniskillen. When my mum first held me in her arms she must have had mixed feelings as my father was desperately ill, awaiting le-threatening surgery for TBin London’s Royal Brompton Hospital.They were both closely associated with TB.My father, TheodoreWarmington was a young doctor in wartime-Belfast’s Forster Green Hospital when he fell in love with student-nurse Gertrude Kessler, my mum to be!  and Erne Hospital Being Built Behind.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\" webimg TUFZMTINDAyNDEw.jpg width w,  webimg TUFZMTINDAyNDEw.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" and Erne Hospital Being Built Behind.\" fallback\"\" layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Medical Secretary Sarah Elliot. Corrugated Iron TB Clinicand Erne Hospital Being Built Behind.Foster Green was then a specialist TB hospital, amidst the tragic reality of  people in Northern Ireland dying each week from the disease and  new cases occurring.Dad was a TB specialist doctor and mum was a trainee TB nurse when they married and I didn’t meet my father till he ed from the Brompton hospital, minus a TB-ravaged lung, when I was two-years old.His mother also contracted the dreaded ‘consumption’ and survived intact till she was almost  years old. Their shared illness undoubtedly induced my father to specialise in tuberculosis.Ambulance and Ambulance Driver.Killadeas Hospital. Late s.In  the Public HealthAct became law, the Northern Ireland Tuberculosis Authoritywas set up and TB became compulsorily notiable,There were over , sufferers all across our beautul little country and statistics were growing fast. Dad was dispatched to Fermanagh by the NITA to purchase a suitable building for conversion into a TB hospital - a large, hill-top residence beside Lough Erne which became Killadeas Hospital. His le revolved around his duties there and his consultations in the Enniskillen County Hospital and with TB clinics in an old, arch-roofed, corrugated iron hut beside the town’s former Workhouse on the Cornagrade Road.Official Photo of Tuberculosis X-Ray Screening at Harefield Hospital, Hertfordshire, England. The NITA, keen to promote community awareness about the rampant illness, required their chest physicians to provide public talks and lectures about tuberculosis.I proudly attended one of dad’s presentations in my primary school dining hall, intrigued that my little classmates, and the teachers and older pupils in particular, listened so intently.They were probably very apprehensive! We queued to observe hisX-Rays of infected lungs. We listened to each other’s chests with his stethoscope.We gazed in awe through his microscope at blood samples and were told all about the BCG vaccination, the first genuine immunisation against TB.British Satirist James Gillrays Cow Pock Cartoon Published in It was developed from attenuatedbovine-straintuberculosis by Dr Albert Calmette and veterinarian Camille Guérin in , and thus was named BCG . Dad displayed a rather worrying cartoon showing the similarly bovine-strain ‘cowpock vaccine’ being administered to frightened patients with cows emerging from dferent parts of their bodies!BCG was first used on humans in  in France and widely introduced here after WWII. The skin on the upper arm was momentarily, simultaneously and relatively painlessly pierced with half a dozen tiny needles, allowing the vaccine to enter the body.Le at home for a TB doctor’s son in the s was occasionally unnerving. The daily lunch table was adorned with the usual cups, saucers, plates and cutlery….and a test-tube rack! Dad brought home his morning-surgery’s cache of blood-samples which took about half an hour of standing in a steady, vertical position before he measured the results. That was more or less the duration of lunch, so we sipped our soup while the serum settled! And all our family friends were ‘in the business’. Sarah Elliot, Dad’s secretary in his TB clinic, became my adopted Aunty Sarah.She showed me the packed files of X-Rays, two-feet-square, ghostly, black and white images of thousands of Fermanagh-folk’s lungs.Some of the images contained ominous dark ‘shadows’, the very bad news that dad all-too-often imparted to his patents.On Saturday mornings I went with him to Killadeas hospital and made friends with the TB patients, with Dr Edwin James from Dungannon and with other staff. The ambulance driver let me play in hisambulance!In  the Tuberculosis Authority’s s were transferred to the Hospitals Authority and the ious health and welfare committees.The report of the  Tuberculosis Survey Northern Ireland stated - “The legacy of this remarkable tuberculosis organisation…can be seen in the fact that the incidence of tuberculosis in the Province is substantially lower today than in the other areas of the British Isles.”The disease killed more than one billion people worldwide between  and .

would not have the buffer we have now.\"Itrsquos fortuitous that at that time I resisted, because I didnrsquot want to be in a position where we would not have finances available to respond to an emergency.\"I didnrsquot know that the coronavirus was going to hit us, but clearly it is having an effect.\"Wersquore not collecting business rates because wersquove given lots of businesses a

an impact on us in terms of the ability to collect rents and council tax.\"Exactly what that impact will be is unclear.ldquoDespite that, we are continuing to run services, as far as possible and we have seen a massive increase in areas such as recycling and waste.The other area of increased spending is in social services, which normally spends around  per cent of our budget.\"That is going to go up dramatically because people are getting frailer and succumbing to covid- and we are also supporting people in care homes and providing PPE for our staff and the care homes.Overall the virus is

I would like to thank and acknowledge the hard work of the organisers of many of today’s events and those within local communities who contributed to this largely successful day.“I would also like to thank my officers and staff who have worked tirelessly and will continue to do so throughout the night to keep our communities safe.“I would ask everyone, particularly those with influence, to continue to work with us to ensure that the rest of this holiday period can be enjoyed in peace and safety.”Roger Gardiner, Orange grand secretary for Co Armagh, welcomed the PSNI acknowledgement of the efforts made to keep within the guidelines.“We did not expect anything dferent,” he said. “The only real events held by the Orange on Monday were really just a few members laying wreaths at war memorials across the Province. In Co Armagh we held a small outdoor event with less than  members who were all socially distanced.”The Co Armagh event took place at the Museum of Orange Heritage, Sloan’s House, Loughgall, on Monday afternoon.TUV leader Jim Allister also praised the handling of the Twelfth.“Many eyes were on the unionist community on Monday, ready to grasp any real or perceived breach of the regulations,” he said.“The reality is that they were left scrabbling around desperate to find something to complain about as the vast, vast majority heeded the Orange advice to have a Twelfth at home and celebrate responsibly.“The institution has provided tremendous leadership on this and I am delighted that the unionist community has responded so well. “Cancelling what is unquestionably one of the largest cultural events in Europe and foregoing generations of tradition was a big sacrice which deserves much wider recognition than it has received to date and stands in stark contrast to the actions of others in recent days. “While Stormont can no longer even give press conferences about the pandemic because the joint head of government blatantly broke her own guidance to honour a terrorist, there is no need for any Orange leaders to go into hiding. Orangeism rose to the challenge in .”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

From this date, passengers travelling on most bus, train and ferry services in Northern Ireland will be required to wear a face covering. Face coverings will also be required in public transport stations. There will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for health and medical reasons, and for children under the age of . Outdoor areas of a ferry where social distancing can be maintained will be exempt from the requirements, along with school transport.  The Executive has agreed that the cross-departmental group that has been established to consider face coverings will engage with the tour coach and taxi industry to explore extending the requirement to these transport modes. Making the announcement, Minister Nichola Mallon said: “As we move through the Executive’s recovery plan, more and more of the economy and society is opening up. Wemust remember however that Covid- is still with us. We need to remain vigilant and continue to play our part in controlling the virus to protect ourselves and others. “As restrictions on our movement are eased, the safety of passengers and staff remains my priority.The evidence suggests that you can reduce the risk of spreading the virus by wearing a face covering. That is why, with the support of my Executive colleagues and the unions, I am announcing that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport, from Friday July th. “The requirement will apply to passengers and also staff in public areas who are not protected by a screen. However, there will be exemptions for those who are not able to wear a face covering for specic health and medical reasons.” A face covering is a covering of any type which covers a person’s nose and mouth it does not have to be a surgical face mask. While face coverings can offer protection to others, they are not a substitute for other protective measures and it is important that people continue to follow social distancing and wash or sanitise hands regularly. Minister Mallon continued: “We are asking you to take personal responsibility and do the right thing to protect the health and well-being of others. The fact of the matter is you can spread the virus to other more vulnerable people without even knowing you have it. By wearing a face covering you are showing your support and consideration for other passengers and staff. “It is important to be aware that wearing face coverings will not be suitable for all members of the public and we need to be sensitive to this and know that reasons for not wearing a face covering may not always be visible. “Advice will be available on nidirect and social media channels. Translink staffwill begin preparing commuters for the requirement to wear face coverings. “It is also important that you do not get a  sense of security about the level of protection a face covering offers. They are not a substitute for social distancing or good hand hygiene. While I know many will find it challenging in the coming days and weeks to keep up compliance with the rules, I want to applaud the public for their leadership. The public have done the heavy lting and kept us all safe. You have been the leaders in Northern Ireland fighting Covid- and I am asking you to keep it up and we will beat this together. “By acting together and thinking of each other we can reduce the risk of transmission.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efbbbafdfaeec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbdccedfccfcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/GN4_DAT_3132859.jpg--.jpg?1589969356000\\","title":"castlederg security alert ends ","story":"A security alert at Millbrook Gardens in Castlederg has ended, and a suspicious object which was examined at the scene, declared a hoax.
