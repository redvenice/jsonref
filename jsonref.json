Ireland has a problem with them  given the proportion of the State’s energy supply they consume.  Photograph: Alan BetsonEvery day, the world’s population generates 500 million tweets, 294 billion emails, four million gigabytes of Facebook data, 65 billion WhatsApp messages and 720,000 hours of YouTube content.And those figures, collected in May by the Conversation magazine, are already out of date. Nearly everything we do consumes data – the storage of text, video, photos and audio, fuelled by all generations, but especially the young.Constantly switched on “zoomers”, aka Generation Z (roughly encompassing young people under 25), are the classical manifestation of this species, identified by their extra “limb” – the smartphone.Given there is an emerging climate crisis, it begs key questions: where are the environmental pressure points arising from this digital lifestyle – and will people change their behaviour?The evidence on digitally intensive living is often surprising and contrary to public perception. Climate impacts of streaming video, for instance, are relatively modest.Digital intensityIt also suggests that data centres, the workhorses of big tech, may not be ogres, though Ireland has a particular problem with them at present, given the proportion of the State’s energy supply they consume.So how digitally intensive are our lives? This year’s Behaviour \u0026amp Attitudes techscape report showed that the use of smart TVs, wearable devices and smart hubs has increased.Just 7 per cent of people here had personal devices such as Fitbits etc in 2018. Today that number has risen to 32 per cent. Broadband is now a utility not a luxury for all those under 54. Two-thirds of us now buy online.“The most profound theme emerging over the last two years, however, relates to the extent to which technology has permeated through to all aspects of our everyday lives, says B\u0026ampA director Anita Mullan.Covid-19 cemented the dependence on digital. Probably driven by social isolation, almost half of us claim to have increased our social media use since the pandemic. Two in five say they cannot imagine their lives without social media.DCU climate researcher Sadhbh O’Neill points to contrasting roles of technology in society. It liberated humans from dogged work in the past today it concentrates incredible power in technology companies. This has digitised social interaction and transformed relationships, including the act of buying and selling something.“I’m not saying this is morally wrong but it is transforming society in ways not being talked about, which is also a lot more problematic from an environmental point of view,” she adds.There is a high carbon footprint associated with digitised consumerism, yet technology has huge potential to assist decarbonisation through use of smart devices linked to appliances, O’Neill says.Pure livingEnvironmentally pure living is impossible. Human actions more often than not have a carbon footprint even an email generates 0.3g CO2. Just one email, to be clear.Sometimes doing what appears environmentally sound may not be – as Prince Charles learned this week about his 50-year-old Aston Martin run on cheese and wine byproducts.The bioethanol derived from those sources should not be mistaken for a serious solution to decarbonise vehicles, the Transport \u0026amp Environment NGO declared.It’s rare that actions are clearly ided between bad and green. Covid prompted many to move from Dublin to rural areas. It spurs remote working and rural communities, but will lead to a greater dependence on cars.Netflix vs carInaccurate studies and misinformation – such as “emissions generated by watching 30 minutes of Netflix is the same as driving a car four miles” – prompted the International Energy Agency to issue a seminal fact-checking paper, including an emissions calculator.The 2019 research was in response to exponential growth in video streaming. Covid led to people being confined at home and consuming even more. Digitalenergy analyst George Kamiya has updated the findings. He showed studies of emissions from watching 30 minutes of Netflix exaggerate the climate impact “up to 90 times”.The low impact is thanks to improvements in the energy efficiency of data centres, networks and devices. “But slowing efficiency gains, rebound effects and new demands from emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain, raise increasing concerns about the overall environmental impacts of the sector over the coming decades.”In the process of simply existing, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin use astonishing amounts of electricity, according a New York Times investigation. That usage, 0.5 per cent of global electricity consumed, has increased tenfold in the past five years. Managing a digital currency with no central authority requires a whole lot of computing power – a single bitcoin is worth about $50,000 today.Flawed assumptions exaggerate the electricity consumption of data centres and transmission networks, Kamiya also concluded.UCC energy specialist Dr Hannah Daly confirms “in the grand scale of things data and video is very low in terms of carbon footprint” while globally data centres account for just 1 per cent of electricity demand.Moreover, she says, digitisation can bring carbon benefits as indicated by reading a newspaper online or streaming instead of buying a physical DVD. Such actions are dematerialising the economy. Decarbonisation of electricity is happening very quickly it will be the first sector to be decarbonised.Cleaner technology can lead people to consume more – known as the “rebound effect”, she notes, reflected in the way a cordless Dyson vacuum has taken over sweeping floors in her house.Ireland’s dataThe data storage process is becoming more centralised and more efficient “and far less energy-intensive”, Daly notes, especially where data centres are tied into district heating enabling excess heat to warm nearby buildings and homes. Meanwhile, “globally, demand is flatlining”, she confirms.The picture in Ireland is different because of a mismatch between a huge increase in energy use and a small national grid, she believes. “That threatens Ireland’s climate change targets and energy security. The real focus should be on decarbonising the grid and decarbonising transport and heat – and not on downloading video.”Digital pollutionGlobal e-waste for 2021 will total 60 million tonnes and is growing annually by 3 to 4 per cent, due to higher consumption rates of electronics, shorter product lifecycles and limited repair options. In 2019 high-value, recoverable materials conservatively valued at €49 billion were mostly dumped or burned rather than being collected for treatment and reuse. The average home in Europe has one in six electronic items broken or unused.Change By Degrees director Dr Tara Shine says digital pollution in the form of sheer volume of content is also a growing issue: “Bloated websites with video backgrounds, multi-image carousels, rotating banners and other multimedia formats require large amounts of energy on an ongoing basis. It takes energy to digitally create and launch a website and then more energy again every time it’s accessed by someone on their device.”Smaller, more concise newsletters equal smaller, less polluting footprints, she adds.There is a lack of awareness of the implications, Shine believes, especially on how to store content efficiently as lives become more digital.Behavioural disconnectAnd there is a disconnect between acknowledging the problem yet failing to change behaviour. Covid-19 illustrated how concerted action can reduce carbon pollution albeit for the wrong reasons. Energy-related carbon emissions dropped by 11.5 per cent last year. The largest fall was in aviation, a 64 per cent reduction – that’s 2.1 million tonnes of CO2e.Recent figures show air travel is rebounding, indicating people may have unprecedented awareness of the climate crisis yet they favour cheap foreign travel which is not subject to carbon tax.Young people may not respond, Shine says, because they are “frozen in fear” as indicated by a recent global survey which found 80 per cent of people in the 16-25 age category fear for the future – mainly due to the crisis. It depends a lot on personality. Others are “hyper-concerned” and agitating for action, while with another category, “it’s just not on their radar and they continue to buy fast fashion”.When lecturing on sustainable energy, Hannah Daly polls students and finds they have huge environmental consciousness combined with being worried and feeling powerless. “They are not to blame for this. Most of them don’t have a car and will be working beyond 2050 trying to decarbonise as quickly as possible . . . and people have handed them an over-heating planet.”Daly cites changes, as indicated by UK car travel peaking because young people are more inclined to take sustainable options.The way young people consume media has been transformed so they get their news from technology companies such as SnapChat, Sadhbh O’Neill notes the same technology companies target them as a product with advertising.Blocked messageWhile they have a high degree of environmental awareness, a recent Irish survey found 57 per cent of 15-24 year olds did not know where to get information about climate change. This “extraordinary” finding suggests the message is not getting through. At the same time, they are being influenced by untrustworthy web sources. “I worry about that,” she adds.Anita Mullan of B\u0026ampA says consumers gravitate towards those who share their views (confirmation bias), which means those who want to downplay environmental issues or convince themselves it’s all a conspiracy can find plenty of back-up for those views online. “Obviously it works the other way too. This means sensible discussion about the environment is difficult to facilitate online.”In addition, there is a residual idea among consumers everything that happens online is more environmentally sound than things that happen in the real world. “This is shaped by things like digital is better for the environment than print, online platforms better than travel. People aren’t yet engaging with the idea that the servers needed for our digital requirements are incredibly energy-intensive,” Mullan adds.All the while, the digital carbon footprint grows and the IEA fears there may be trouble ahead as “it is becoming increasingly likely that efficiency gains from current technologies may be unable to keep pace with this growing data demand” in coming years."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer Stormont first minister Peter Robinson has accused the EU of “irrational political prejudice” and warned that it must “go back to the drawing board” over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The ex-DUP leader described reforms to the post-Brexit arrangements outlined by European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday as an “upgrade” but insisted “much more movement will be required” to bring unionists on board.He suggested triggering the contentious Article 16 of the protocol - which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers them to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties” - may be necessary “to achieve that goal”. Mr Robinson also accuses the SDLP, Alliance and Sinn Féin of a “grovelling endorsement” of the EU’s proposed reforms, which would scrap most checks on goods moving between Britain and the North.The de facto Irish Sea border was erected under the protocol, agreed by London and Brussels, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the EU single market after the UK pulled out of the bloc. “What gets me most is the irrational political prejudice and overbearing haughtiness of the EU, who think that it is a greater priority to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland than between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom of which we are part,” Mr Robinson wrote in his weekly column for The Newsletter. Favoured by nationalistsHe alleged that Mr Sefcovic was only interested in protecting gains from the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement which are favoured by nationalists. The 1998 peace deal was “damaging” and “it is heresy for any unionist, especially with the benefit of hindsight, to praise” it, he wrote. Mr Robinson said the agreement “threw the jail gates open for terrorists to flood out, destroyed the RUC, allowed Sinn Féin into government while republicans held on to their bombs and guns, continued murdering, relentlessly persisted with their criminality, while refusing to support the police or recognise the authority of the courts”.He said he was “unimpressed” by the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance party offering a “grovelling endorsement of the EU proposals”. “These parties welcomed the protocol in its original form and there would have been no change if it had been left to them,” he wrote. “They are content to maintain the denial of democratic accountability for laws that will be made by the EU and imposed in Northern Ireland. They accept that the EU should be both advocate and judge in its own cause when there is a dispute about trading matters.‘Sleight of hand’“They endorse the constitutional sleight of hand that declares Great Britain to be a ‘third country’ in relation to Northern Ireland trade and they applaud maintaining checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.”Mr Robinson said the EU was also completely ignoring “ the constitutional, legal, and democratic implications of the protocol and seems to think it is only the trading element of the protocol that needs to be considered.”“Even in that narrow perspective they fall short. If the problem was limited to the costly compliance requirements and time-consuming checking of goods within the United Kingdom the answer is the removal of those checks, not a reduction in their number,” he wrote. Reacting to Mr Robinson’s comments about the Belfast Agreement, Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Friday said: “I am surprised at that language but I haven’t heard that sentiment. “I met with all of the political parties last Friday, all of them articulated to me a desire to maintain the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Assembly and the Executive to ensure the continuation of political stability.”Mr Martin also defended the latest set of proposals from Mr Sefcovic and the EU, pointing out that Mr Sefcovic had very carefully and very deliberately gone to Northern Ireland to hear from all shades of political opinion there before coming up with his latest proposals.“First of all,Maros Sefcovic went to the North, he met with all the political parties and he met with all of the representatives of business and industry in Northern Ireland and he listened at first hand. I would have met him before he went to the North, his objectives are genuine and sincere in trying to make the protocol work for all of the people of Northern Ireland,” said Mr Martin.Mr Martin said he recalled a conversation with Mr Robinson some years ago when Mr Robinson lamented the fact that Northern Ireland did not have the equivalent of the IDA to attract in foreign investment as the agency was doing in the Republic.“I believe having access to the Single European Market is a huge advantage to jobs and to business and to industry in Northern Ireland and the measures brought forward by the commission this week through Maros Sefcovic really advance that agenda in terms of inward investment into the North but also allowing businesses in the North to grow through exports to the European Union market,” said Mr Martin.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a what restrictions are due to lift and what is the government thinking","story":"Requirements for masks and social distancing are likely to remain in some settings.

There are senior members of Cabinet who believe a pause in the lifting of restrictions is inevitable if the situation gets worse, but who also believe that it is not necessary to pause everything at the same time. For them an obvious choice would be to continue use of vaccination certificates in order to get into pubs and restaurants and other venues. If the Covid-19 figures continue to deteriorate, this will become a key part of the debate and retaining the cert is likely to be an option that gains traction.What about masks?The requirement to wear a mask will remain on public transport, in healthcare settings and in retail. Government is currently weighing up whether to relax the rules around outdoor and private, indoor settings.The reality is that many people are not wearing masks in private, indoor settings. The question is whether it would be wise to remove the requirement for masks in busy, crowded outdoor spaces. One source said on Friday the data does appear to show a deteriorating trend and therefore the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) may not feel comfortable sending out a signal that its okay to ditch the masks just yet.How about events and ceremonies?Many in Government believe it should be possible to allow for increased attendances at weddings, civil ceremonies and religious events, particularly for the vaccinated. The question is whether to lift those limits entirely or keep a cap on them. Government sources are adamant they have not yet had this conversation, but if the vaccine certificate is retained this could be a route to safely increasing numbers.And, household mixing in homes and gardens?It’s a little under a year since the Government decided to ease restrictions just before the Christmas period, when three households were allowed to mix in late December. The picture is very different now because of Ireland’s very high vaccination uptake. At present, fully vaccinated people can visit together indoors with no limit on numbers. If you or any of the people you live with aren’t fully vaccinated, you can have visitors from one other unvaccinated household. While there is anxiety about changing rules for the unvaccinated, there is a feeling the Government would prefer to move away from rigid restrictions when it comes to private homes.Are restrictions lifting on nightclubs?This is a particularly fraught question. There are mounting concerns in Government that it could be a mistake to allow venues like nightclubs to reopen. On the other hand, there is a very real fear that if the reopening is put off, it may be hard to offer a definite date for a future reopening, particularly if the prevalence of the disease does not decrease and remains at the same level for weeks to come. This will be one to watch on Monday.Is the return to the office off?A phased return to workplaces began in September and while some in Government believe this should continue, a dampener was put on the situation by the deputy chief medical officer Ronan Glynn on Friday. He said people should work from home where possible throughout this autumn and winter. The Cabinet will not want to deviate too far from Nphet advice when it arrives on Monday but there was some surprise at his comments on Friday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Growing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"could jeff bezoss space race help save planet","story":"It’s rare for Prince William to inhabit the same atmosphere as Gil Scott-Heron. But the future heir’s tart response to Jeff Bezos flying William Shatner to space this week – “We need some of the world’s greatest brains and minds fixed on trying to repair this planet, not trying to find the next place to go and live,” the Duke of Cambridge said – had echoes of Scott-Heron’s influential 1970 spoken-word track, Whitey on the Moon.Over clattering percussion, Scott-Heron pretty much nailed the disinterested shrug of people at the hard end of the world’s problems at seeing Neil Armstrong’s landmark 1969 moon walk: “A rat done bit my sister Nell, with Whitey on the moon. Her face and arms began to swell, and Whitey’s on the moon,” his languid vocals proclaim.Certainly, at first sight, the regular transport of wealthy people into low Earth orbit – a prospect now closer than ever – seems like the answer to a question the planet wasn’t asking.SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket burns kerosene and Virgin’s VSS Unity uses a solid carbon-based fuel, hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene and liquid nitrous oxide. Which, Eloise Marais, associate professor of physical geography at University College London, estimates burn 200-300 tonnes of carbon dioxide per launch. Split between four or so passengers, this compares highly unfavourably with the one to three tonnes of carbon dioxide per passenger for long-haul flights. While there were only 114 rocket launches in the whole of 2020, Sir Richard Branson’s ambition alone is for 400 flights per year.But might such forays have their uses for the whole of mankind after all?Space travel and the environmental movement have been strange bedfellows ever since the Pioneer 1 satellite used the first practical solar panels in 1958. Satellites have been driving innovation in solar panels ever since, and have proven crucial in determining crop health, forest fires, glacier coverage, the spread of urban development and damage to the rainforests.Indeed, space travel has been a rich source of new green tech. The hydrogen and fuel cell technologies invented to take Apollo astronauts into space are now touted as a clean, reliable (albeit achingly expensive) alternative to batteries that can power anything from aeroplanes, such as the Pathfinder and Helio prototypes, to warships. Home insulation – hello there, Insulate Britain – owes much to spacesuit design.Meanwhile, NASA is a leader in green engineering. By necessity, all human space travel involves recycling practically everything – water, air and food – so the space agency has been responsible for breakthroughs in water filtration, waste water treatment and soil cleaning agents. It is also one of the world’s biggest researchers into the science of hydroponics – growing crops without using land resources.“Space-based technologies and space-derived information are central to climate knowledge, science, monitoring and early warning,” says Nick Shave, chair of UKspace, the trade association of the British space industry. “In the future, new applications of satellite data, combined with satellite positioning and communications technologies, will help drive down carbon emissions as well as providing key capabilities required to manage the devastating effects of the climate emergency to countries and communities around the world.”The link between the environment and space travel is even more far-out than that. Bill Anders, crew member of the Apollo 8 mission, became the first human to witness the Earth peeking over the Moon’s horizon in 1968. Anders had been snapping the Moon’s surface on a scouting mission for future landings when he took the photograph later known as Earthrise. That single snap is credited with inspiring the first Earth Day in 1970, about which Anders later said: “We came all this way to explore the Moon, and the most important thing is that we discovered the Earth.”California’s environmental movement of the early 1970s gave birth to the Whole Earth Catalogue, a compendium of product listings, how-to diagrams and educational ephemera intended for the back-to-the-land movement, which featured Earthrise on its first cover. Published quarterly in 1971 and sporadically thereafter, its biggest influence was on Silicon Valley: founders of Airbnb, Stripe and Facebook, early-internet architects including Larry Brilliant, Lee Felsenstein, Ted Nelson and Steve Jobs, described the Catalog as “Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along”.This freak-powerbillionaire crossover means that while SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy emits more CO2 in a few minutes than the average car would in more than two centuries, in 2019 it carried a NASA-funded test satellite known as the Green Propellant Infusion Mission, to replace the outrageously polluting and ferociously lethal hydrazine. The new hydroxyl ammonium nitrate fueloxidizer blend – called AF-M315E for short – can be carried around without wearing a hazmat suit, is more efficient and emits more water than CO2.By comparison, Bezos’s rocket, Blue Origin, is powered by a mix of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, meaning its carbon footprint – in flight, if not in construction – is zero. Given Blue Origin’s reusable launch vehicle, the project’s biggest overall source of CO2 is likely to be the crew and passengers’ flights to its Texas launch site. Just don’t mention the CO2 given off by Amazon’s server farms…And then there’s the real out-there thinking of Elon Musk. Musk has credited his drive to many things – including growing up in apartheid South Africa and leaving aged 17, rather than serve in what he called “a fascist army” – but the man’s absolute conviction that the Earth is doomed explains his unsettling desire to move to Mars.“A lot of my motivation comes from looking at things that don’t work well and feeling a bit sad about how it would manifest in the future,” he has said. “If that would result in an unhappy future, then it makes me unhappy, so I want to fix it.”Alongside the Tesla, the car that made electric vehicles cool at last, he’s proposed ‘Hyperloop’ high-speed transportation systems, using reduced pressure tubes to reach speeds around 600mph – which Branson has neatly whipped from under his nose with the all-electric Virgin Hyperloop’s first successful test earlier this year. Musk has put up $100 million for carbon capture technology, and given up on cryptocurrencies due to their voracious dependency on electricity.The UK is clinging on to the edge of all this. British rocket maker Orbex is pioneering bio-propane fuel that chief executive Chris Larmour says can cut CO2 emissions by 90 per cent, compared with traditional launch fuel. “Climate change is real, and we don’t want to make it worse,” he explains.After Brexit, the UK is no longer part of Galileo and EGNOS, the EU-owned satnav systems, but we’re hustling to get involved in its Copernicus Earth Observation programme, and we’ve still got a role in the soon-to-be carbon-neutral European Space Agency. “The UK has already taken a lead in committing to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050,” says Shave. “The next step should be properly investing in our space industry to help us become a world leader in action as well as words.”If we start to dream of space again, perhaps we can start to get a genuinely global perspective. If we can solve problems down here by trying to put someone on the Moon, what could we achieve if we all got a chance to see Earth rise?More from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersWanted: a National Trust leader who can be trusted to love its heritage all over againIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Working class accent seen as sign of being ‘less intelligent’, study findsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"another winter discontent wouldnt good unions labour","story":"Is there a danger that the trade union Unite has learned all the wrong lessons from the Winter of Discontent of 197879?I vaguely recall that famous dispute of more than four decades ago because my father was, at the time, a shop steward for the (now defunct) Transport and General Workers’ Union and our house was littered with trade union literature, including posters and information leaflets detailing HGV drivers’ grievances.I wonder if, in the years afterwards, Dad looked back on that strike with the same enthusiasm with which he distributed those leaflets and posters to his fellow tanker drivers at the time? He certainly regarded the subsequent triumph of Margaret Thatcher’s Conservatives as one of the worst things that had ever happened to the country did he acknowledge his own role in undermining Jim Callaghan’s already beleaguered Labour government? Not to me, he didn’t.It might be useful to gain some sort of insight into the minds of Unite officials who, it seems, yearn to recreate that dreadful winter by encouraging their members to strike in support of better pay and working conditions, just at the point when Britons are gearing up to enjoy Christmas. Of course, unions’ job is to fight for better conditions for their members, and staging strikes in the run-up to the festive season gives their cause extra leverage.But after last year’s somewhat flat celebrations in pandemic Britain, this year was supposed to be the time when families could get together again and have a proper celebration. Christmas 2021 could be the cathartic event that finally draws a line under nearly two years of dreadful doubt, fear and chaos.Alternatively it could provide a chance for Unite to throw its weight around and prove to the country that it’s not, after all, a steadily diminishing industrial force of increasing irrelevance to modern day workers.That’s an interesting phrase of choice: “We will not hesitate.” So at a time when driver shortages have given existing drivers – including those who are not members of any trade union – more industrial heft than at any recent point in history, the biggest transport union “will not hesitate” to go from nought to sixty, from park to fifth gear, to call its members out on strike.As a lifelong watcher of the labour and trade union movement, this all feels like a tired, cumbersome old institution seeking vainly to attract some attention by pretending to be relevant, and perhaps attracting some much-needed new members while it does so. And who is to suffer as a consequence of its belligerence? Ordinary working people trying to celebrate Christmas with their families. Yeah, job done there, comrades.And where is the Labour Party in all of this? Have we heard any of Keir Starmer’s front benchers even raise a quizzical eyebrow in response to the sabre rattling from their party’s biggest donor? Have MPs, as well as Unite, forgotten that 40 years ago it was the Labour Party, not their political opponents, who suffered the most catastrophic damage as a result of the widespread industrial action that made Britain an international laughing stock?It would, however, be foolish to expect any Labour MP to criticise, even obliquely, Unite or any other affiliated trade union too many of them, having left university and then secured a comfortable desk job as a trade union official or as an MP’s researcher, proudly added their union membership to their CVs in order to win their union’s endorsement when they put themselves forward for a Labour seat in parliament. Now is not the time to bite the hand that feeds them.And yet, if public anger turns on the trade unions who are needlessly making life even more difficult than it needs to be, will there be a re-examination of the dysfunctional relationship between Labour and its trade union paymasters? “No,” the MPs will say (and some of them will even mean it), “the unions provide a crucial link between the party and ordinary working people. It’s what keeps us grounded.”So here’s a question: given that Labour has just lost four general elections in a row, given that the party has won a total of just five working majorities in its entire 120-year-long existence (and three of those were while it was being led by a man who most trade union leaders, and especially the leadership of Unite, despise), how has that trade union link actually helped the party? If Labour needs its trade union link to stay in touch with the priorities of ordinary working people, how come most working class voters support Boris Johnson’s Conservatives?Yes, the unions founded the Labour Party. But so what? Life moves on. The main opposition party should be free, if necessary, to raise genuine doubts it might have about the wisdom of a powerful trade union making life unnecessarily difficult for shoppers in the run up to Christmas. But so long as the Labour-trade union link exists, that will never happen. More from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersWanted: a National Trust leader who can be trusted to love its heritage all over againIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Working class accent seen as sign of being ‘less intelligent’, study findsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cant go forcing children self isolate","story":"I have gained a newfound respect for the Oxford-AstraZeneca nerds after my Covid-addled eight-year-old breathed directly into my face on Monday to prove she had brushed her teeth before bedtime.Well, you could hardly blame the kid for forgetting she has a highly infectious disease spread by airborne transmission since she has had no symptoms whatsoever.Thanks to the miracles worked by those men and women in white coats, my double-jabbed husband and I have stayed negative despite spending the past two weeks living in a den of plague.First our eldest got it. At 12 going on 21, she happily ensconced herself in her room with an Amazon Fire TV Stick and a stash of Pot Noodles and we barely saw her for the obligatory 10 days. Indeed, we hardly noticed the difference between her being in self-isolation and what used to be known as “family time”.Being the sort of people who separate their recycling, we diligently followed the Government (and school) advice to lateral flow-test our other two children daily, as well as ourselves. Lo and behold our youngest, Little Miss Mentadent, got the dreaded double line less than a week later, swiftly followed by our 11-year-old son.We did try to separate the blighters, honest, but how the hell are you supposed to self-isolate an eight year old? Since coronavirus is now ripping through secondary schools, what’s to say they didn’t get it from an asymptomatic classmate or a child whose parents don’t separate their recycling? We will never know.What is certain, however, is that they have now lost another month of school between them, despite there being nothing seriously wrong with any of them. The eldest had a mild sore throat, the boy has had a bit of a cough – but under normal circumstances they would have been sent on their way with an Ultrabalm pocket pack, and possibly some Tunes if I was feeling really generous. (As a doctor’s daughter I practically had to be decapitated to miss a day of school – and even then my father would probably have applied Steri-Strips while insisting “you absolutely don’t need stitches”.)The sheer ridiculousness of having to homeschool three otherwise healthy children could not have been better demonstrated than by the repeated calls I had to field from NHS T and T (Test and trace? Track and trace? Don’t test me on it, I’ve lost track) – even though, again, being responsible citizens, we had already told anyone who needed to know.As well as discovering that “T and T” cannot actually test, track or trace school contacts (eh?), I was also informed that “for safeguarding reasons”, I could not report all of my children’s “other” close contacts at the same time, even though they solely comprised my husband and me (and possibly the cat, although “close” is probably overstating it). Apparently, I could only do it separately. Three times. For a minimum of 25 minutes per call. “For safeguarding reasons”, I refused.How much is this service still costing the taxpayer? And why are we still testing asymptomatic children at all? My husband and I are far from the only parents not to have caught coronavirus from their infected offspring.According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, the percentage of people currently testing positive is highest in secondary school pupils at around 7 per cent but just 1.2 per cent in those aged 35 to 49. The infection rate in the over-50s is half that, at 0.6 per cent.So even though Covid-19 is seemingly spreading like wildfire through the Snapchat generation – old Facebooker farts like us aren’t catching it anywhere near the same rate thanks to the success of the vaccination rollout. I accept that the Year 7 to 11-ers may be overrepresented in the charts because we are testing them more – but that in itself begs the question: why?Why, when children are at far less risk of being hospitalised and dying from coronavirus, are we treating them like we are still in peak pandemic mode? Adults aren’t being obliged to take two lateral flow tests a week, so why are children?All of this also raises the bigger question of what the point of continued mass testing really is when the only route back to normality is to treat Covid as we would any other endemic disease.The revelation that 43,000 people are thought to have been given incorrect negative PCR results by an NHS-sanctioned laboratory in Wolverhampton rather suggests that the whole system is not fit for purpose.What we can say for certain is that almost two years on from the March 2020 lockdown, children continue to carry the burden of a disease that doesn’t even affect them – when nearly 80 per cent of the population over 12 have been double-jabbed. It makes no sense.Children obviously shouldn’t be in school if they are actually ill. But rather than keeping healthy children at home, we should be entering a phase where we accept that Covid is here to stay, that unvaccinated children are predominantly going to catch and spread it but that it’s okay because the success of the vaccine rollout means we have protected not just the vulnerable and the immuno-suppressed but the overwhelming majority of teachers and parents.Even the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health thinks mass testing in schools should end, arguing that it is causing unnecessary chaos, spreading needless fear and adversely affecting children’s mental health.Miriam Cates, the MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, has rightly argued that mass testing in schools is “utterly pointless” and “just another example of treating children as second class citizens”. A number of health experts have also quite reasonably asked what evidence there is to show that this sledgehammer to crack a nut approach is actually stopping transmission and infection.This week, Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, highlighted another problem with the status quo – ongoing unexplained absence in schools.With one in 40 pupils missing school due to Covid last week, up from around one in 80 at the start of the school term, Mr Zahawi has warned headteachers that extended coronavirus absences must be curbed. Clearly recognising that a lack of schooling has a more significant negative impact on children than Covid itself, he said attending school was “a national priority” and essential for children’s “well-being and long-term development”.Well, if that is the case, minister, why are you actively continuing to keep children away from the classroom?The long-term knock-on effect of all this absenteeism should not be overlooked.According to the Centre for Social Justice think tank, nearly 100,000 children failed to return to schools full-time after they reopened. These pupils remain unaccounted for. They are the lost children of lockdown. I shudder to think how many of them have become vulnerable to local gangs or dangerous home environments.Meanwhile, the pandemic has caused a surge of kids to vanish from the school roll. Officials do not know how many pupils are home-schooled, or why. No register is kept. But the best guess is 75,000 pupils, a figure that surged by almost 40 per cent last year.So we have at least 175,000 children who can’t be tracked or traced, which rather makes a mockery of every single infuriating phone call I have received this week. More from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersWanted: a National Trust leader who can be trusted to love its heritage all over againIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Working class accent seen as sign of being ‘less intelligent’, study findsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"could west do deal putin keep lights winter","story":"The message was delivered with the kind of knowing shrug that only a long and successful career in the KGB can really train you for. Speaking at an energy conference in Moscow on Wednesday, alongside the chief executives of Exxon Mobil, BP, and Total, the Russian President Vladimir Putin was quick to deny that his country was using its control of Europe’s gas supplies to advance his nation’s own interests. “We’re not using any weapons,” he said, a trademark steely glint in his eye, dismissing talk of geo-strategic blackmail as “politically motivated blather”. On the contrary, he was, the President insisted, making sure gas supplies were stepped up. If there were any problems, they were all the fault of someone else. Russia was here to help its neighbours.Well, up to a point. There is no question that Europe is gripped by an energy crisis as severe as any it has faced since the 1970s, and that the UK is right in the thick of it. Prices are soaring. Energy firms are going bust. There is talk of factory closures, three day weeks, and rolling blackouts. In the background, and whatever his denials, Putin, a political leader well versed in the dark arts of manipulation and great power politics, has levers at his disposal and won’t hesitate to pull them. When he denies using gas supplies as a weapon, one thing is for certain. That is precisely what he is doing. They are as much of an instrument of war as his country’s tanks, mortars and missiles ever were. And they are pointed at precisely the same place – the heart of the West.In truth, we are in the middle of a ‘gas shock’ that is likely to be as profound as the ‘oil shock’ that reshaped the world in the 1970s. For the Government, as for governments across the continent, the questions are about to come thick and fast. How did we get into this mess? How can we get out of it? And perhaps most of all, what price are we willing to pay to keep our lights turned on, our homes and public buildings warm and factories open?The UK and Europe’s energy crisis has been years in the making. Over the course of the past year, wholesale gas prices have risen more than fivefold. On some days of frantic trading, prices have been soaring by 20 or 30 per cent in a single session, a sign of a market under severe stress. The reason? The switch to cleaner, renewable energy, while welcome in itself, has meant that demand for gas, viewed by policy-makers as a reliable, not-too-dirty transitional fuel, has been steadily increasing. The massive size of stimulus programmes around the world as we recover from the Covid pandemic has translated into vast and unexpected increases in demand. A lack of wind has meant that renewable energy has not been as plentiful as expected, and gas is being used as a back-up. Meanwhile, China, along with much of the developing world, has been absorbing huge  quantities of gas to fuel its constantly expanding industrial machine. The development of liquified natural gas (LNG) transported around the world on huge container ships has created a global market very similar to oil. Most of the demand comes from Asia, with Europe largely an afterthought, but the trouble with being an afterthought is you don’t have much security of supply. And in the background, Russia, the only country with sufficient reserves to make a real difference to the market, is widely believed to have been holding back supplies, both to maximise its leverage with the West, and to remind everyone just how much the continent still relies on plentiful supplies of its energy. The result? A supply crunch, with soaring prices and bottlenecks throughout the system.  Britain has been hit especially hard. We have run down our reserves of gas to a mere four-five days of supply, far less than most of our continental rivals. “Pathetic really for a nation as important as the UK,” said Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the billionaire industrialist, tersely in a television interview this week. When we closed down storage facilities we still had back-up supplies from the North Sea we could buy extra gas relatively easily on the world market whenever we needed it and we had rising alternative energy sources that could be ramped up if necessary. At the same time, we ran down nuclear capacity, while France was still ramping it up, and our commitment to combating climate change made it virtually impossible to reopen coal mines. The British state has been caught out as hopelessly unprepared as this crisis deepens.  Granted, there is some bad luck in the process. No one could have predicted so many factors all coming together to put pressure on supplies at the same time, but a crisis is always at least in part bad luck. The point is to be prepared for the worst, not simply to hope for the best. The UK failed to do that. “Everything will depend on the weather,” says Laurent Ruseckas, executive director of analyst firm IHS Markit. “When it is really cold Russia needs a lot more gas, and that impacts on its ability to supply Europe.”There are plenty of big producers of gas. The US, Norway, and Qatar are all major exporters. But it is Russia that holds a quarter of the world’s entire proven supply and a network of pipelines that makes it the crucial player. In private, ministers and officials concede that since Russia is the world’s largest exporter, the amount it puts onto the market affects the global wholesale price, and some already believe that that is being turned into political leverage. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told The  last week that energy was being used as a “weapon” by foreign states, although he was careful not to point the finger directly at the Kremlin, while the Tory frontbencher Lord Agnew of Oulton this week went further, arguing outright that soaring energy costs were the result of a “geopolitical move” by Russia to put pressure on Europe. We are less vulnerable to that than some of our neighbours. Unlike mainland Europe, Britain does not rely on Russia for physical supplies of gas. The vast majority in the UK comes from British territorial waters, with the rest from reliable import partners such as Norway, Qatar and other nations in the Middle East, while less than 3 per cent comes from Russia. “Very little physical Russian gas comes to the UK because it makes no sense to transport these molecules all the way from Russia to the UK in the absence of certainty provided by medium or long-term contracts,” Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, told The . Officials agree. “We are not dependent on Russian oil or gas whatsoever. There is no concern about security of supply. This is a question of high global gas prices,” a senior government source told The . “Europe gets about 41 per cent of its gas from Russia. They are massively exposed to the threat of leverage from Moscow. The UK is fortunate enough to have sovereign access to gas reserves in the North Sea in the way that many European countries don’t, so we are far more insulated than our European partners.”Officials may be breezily optimistic, but that is not the whole story. While the UK imports relatively little gas from Russia right now, the latter’s decisions to a large extent determine the global price, and that in turn determines whether Britain can buy the supplies it needs from anywhere. Even worse, right now, there is very little that anyone can do to get out of the situation. “On the supply side, there is not much Europe can do,” argues Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based Bruegel Institute. How bad will it get? “We expect the price to rise as a consequence of tight supply,’’ says Tom Marzec-Manser of the energy consultancy ICIS. “And that will be the main way that the market copes with the issue. We have already seen some industrial shutdowns in Europe as prices rise and we could see more of that. Once that happens, demand will start to fall.” And yet if that doesn’t work, then no one really knows for sure right now what will happen. It is easy to start sketching out doomsday scenarios. We could see shutdowns, with heating and gas stoves turned off pensioners could die of the cold, while the rest of us put on extra coats, and heat up our dinner in the microwave, assuming the electricity network is still running. In reality, it probably won’t get to that point. As a first option, the Government could start restricting supply to industrial users, which accounts for up to 20 per cent of overall demand. Industries such as chemicals, paper, packaging and building materials, all big energy users, could see factories put on three-day weeks. After that, schools and offices could also be put on a three-day week to save energy, and so could retailers (a shopping mall takes a lot of heating in winter), and then possibly closed completely. That would take a huge amount of pressure off the system. After that, there could be the kind of staggered blackouts we saw in the 1970s, designed to eke out meagre supplies through the winter. It wouldn’t be great. But it would mean the heating would keep running for most families. But this would still be a catastrophe for the government. The last Prime Minister to put the country on a three-day week amid an energy crisis was the man who took us into the European Union, Sir Edward Heath. Historians might see a certain irony in the symmetry of the one who took us out of the EU, Boris Johnson, repeating that humiliation. But few people would find it funny and it would destroy any reputation of basic competence. In these circumstances, could Johnson be tempted to ever strike a deal with Putin to keep the lights on? It is already not hard to detect a certain thawing in Britain’s relations with Russia. Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea Football Club, has been seen at the team’s games again, after an 18-month gap amid visa issues. We have heard less and less about the outrageous poisonings on British soil. Is the ground being softened up for an ‘arrangement’, to put it politely, that sees Russia ship extra gas to the UK? “Everyone talks about the potential political lever,” says Ruseckas. “But the idea is preposterous. Who do you sit down and talk to, and what do you demand? It is just not how things work.” Well, perhaps. But if it came to not having a choice, having exhausted our supplies and not being in a fit state of preparedness what would a deal look like?  As it happens, the UK might have a few cards up its sleeve. We could quietly back off condemnation for Russia’s military and strategic adventures in the Crimea and Ukraine. Regulators have been trying to wash suspicious Russian money out of the City for years, with ‘unexplained wealth orders’, with Russian companies quietly blocked from listing their shares on the London market, and with the banks forced to be a lot more circumspect about accepting even the largest deposits. A Russian economy that is booming on the back of soaring energy prices – the Moscow stock market, not very surprisingly, hit all-time highs this week – will need a major financial centre to process all the money it is raking in. London would be the obvious candidate, if regulators could be persuaded to back off a little. That would be worth something to the enormously wealthy Putin and even more to his cronies. Even leaving aside the concessions that sound like a sub-plot from a John Le Carré novel, there is still plenty Britain could do to persuade the Russians to sell us more gas. Russia has very few trade deals around the world, and Britain has backed off from negotiating one, in part because of Russia’s poor reputation, but mainly because we have been too busy working on post-Brexit deals with Australia, Japan and the US. But Russia would desperately like one, if only to help integrate its economy into the Western world it could set a precedent for other deals. What  would really convince Russia would be long-term gas supply contracts, with the fossil fuel guaranteed a place among the mix of energy resources for years to come. Some of Gazprom’s gas arrives in the UK as LNG, and there are capacities at British gas terminals for additional supply, while some of it comes as piped gas, which travels in pipelines from the continent. Gazprom, the largest Russian energy supplier, typically signs take-or-pay long-term contracts with its customers in Europe, meaning that the buyer commits to purchase a certain amount of gas every year even if it realises later that it doesn’t need that much, while Russia offers a stable price less dependent on market fluctuations.“If the UK buyers were to sign medium to long-term contracts with Russia, that would provide them with some insulation against extreme price volatility,” says Yafimava. It would be a risky gambit. “No one is going to want to sign one of those deals right at the top of the market,” cautions one energy market insider. “But if you were willing to commit to four or five years, the Russian suppliers would probably find you some gas even though it would be expensive.” Put it all together, and Britain might be able to put together a package that is attractive enough to persuade Russia to sell us just enough gas to keep the country running. Of course, we are still a long way from that point. Ministers are not even considering it right now. It would leave us dangerously exposed and the UK is determined to make a success of the Cop26 climate summit later this month. “Russia’s main priority will be Russian consumers,” says Marzec-Manser. “As they meet that, and as they refill their own storage, will they increase supply onto the global spot market? We may start to see that as we head into November and that will help the market calm down.” That will certainly be a relief to everyone. The weather may well be mild throughout the winter, which, as Kwasi Kwarteng told business leaders this week, would ease demand. Extra supply may turn up if factories in Europe close simply because energy prices are ridiculously high. A recession in China, by no means impossible with its property market wobbling, would reduce demand even further. Something may turn up at the last minute, as it often does. If it doesn’t, however, the British economy will be in real trouble, and the Government with it.  Additional reporting by Lucy Fisher and Nataliya VasilyevaMore from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersWanted: a National Trust leader who can be trusted to love its heritage all over againIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Working class accent seen as sign of being ‘less intelligent’, study findsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont blame trade unions taking boris word","story":"Imagine you are the leader of a public sector union contemplating putting in a cheeky demand for a pay rise – one you know that your members have not earned through greater productivity. You know that it is likely to end up with a long strike which could cost your members dearly in lost earnings, and that there is no guarantee that they will enjoy a pay rise at the end of it. You are trying to weigh up your chance of success – and then the Prime Minister comes on the radio telling us how he is going to turn Britain into a ‘high wage economy’, trying to make-out that a supply chain crisis is a good thing because it is helping boost pay, and that as a nation we can have our cake and eat it. How do you react? You are going to conclude that your chances of extracting a pay rise from the government has just increased immeasurably.It should come as no surprise, then, that Unite is threatening a lorry driver strike in the run-up to Christmas. It is a direct result of Boris Johnson signalling a lack of fiscal responsibility. In the case of lorry-drivers – most of whom work in the private sector – it is easy to attack Unite for its bone-headedness – why the need to threaten strikes when a labour shortage is pushing up wages anyway? Rather than strike, it should be telling its members: if you don’t like your pay and conditions and your current employer won’t offer you a rise, resign and offer your services to one of the many other companies who are currently screaming out for HGV drivers.But wage demands and strikes aren’t going to end with lorry drivers. Already we have had strikes at DVLA, as we have had on Scotrail. Once unions get wind of the idea that there is easy money on offer, pay demands are going to mushroom. And much of it will come down to Johnson’s own character. It is a good thing in many respects to beam with optimism, to make out we are all going to get rich from doing our everyday jobs. But when you are Prime Minister, loose talk can end up costing taxpayers a fortune.I would like to be able to come down on Rishi Sunak’s side in the obvious and growing tensions between Number 10 and Number 11 over fiscal discipline, although his record isn’t great either. It was he who came up with the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, subsidising our pub lunches. So, too, Dominic Cummings bears responsibility from beyond the political grave – it was he who advocated the suspension of fiscal discipline during a pandemic so as to offer rockstar salaries to hire the best people, culminating with consultants on Test and Trace earning £7,000 per day. Trouble is, everyone working for the public sector thinks they are invaluable – and in most cases they are right that they are of more use than the people who designed our lousy Test and Trace system. Why, they reason, can’t we too have a slice of this very rich government procurement cake?The government went into the pandemic already running a deficit. It is coming out of it with a hole in the public finances such as we have never seen in peacetime. Yet still, somehow, the government has managed to give the impression that there is free money on offer to anyone who wants it. This has not been lost on the unions.More from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersWanted: a National Trust leader who can be trusted to love its heritage all over againIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Working class accent seen as sign of being ‘less intelligent’, study findsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"melbourne embraced zero covid now remains isolated world bounces","story":"It’s a bright cold day in October and the clocks are striking nine. That’s the time when residents of my home town of Melbourne, Australia, must obey a curfew or face crushing fines for breaching health orders. It’s not quite Orwell’s Oceania, but Australia’s second city shares some alarming similarities with the totalitarian regime from Nineteen Eighty-Four.Melbourne holds the dubious record of being the most locked-down city in the world – 260 days and counting. Watching television footage from Italy, India, New York and even London at the peak of their outbreaks terrified many Australians into relinquishing all their civil liberties.Unlike in the UK, where advice is formulated by Sage, Australian state health officers issue restrictions without explaining the science underpinning them. Many experts doubt that rules like curfews curb Covid at all. As cases in locked-down Melbourne reached a record high of 2,300 per day, officials in Sydney ended lockdown early after a vaccination drive. The reason for the spike is that Melbourne’s lockdown-fatigued citizens are secretly breaking all the rules, even those that actually work.Democracy has crumbled under zero Covid, with parliaments shut for months under health orders. The twitching curtain brigade, encouraged by government campaigns urging them to inform on their neighbours, watch for rule-breakers and use special hotlines to summon the police. Melbourne police were recently ordered to patrol playgrounds until a public outcry forced a U-turn. In a park near me, children on scooters flee as a police car pulls up. It’s like a scene from RoboCop.Masks are mandatory outdoors even if walking on a windswept beach or a deserted street. Those caught disobeying may be fined, handcuffed, forcibly masked and arrested if they refuse to comply. In another Orwellian twist, health orders banning protests are issued by bureaucrats reporting to the very leaders the protesters are demonstrating against. Protest organisers, including a pregnant woman, have been arrested in their homes and hit with conspiracy charges. Religious worship, even in small groups outdoors, has been banned.Getting into Australia has been near-impossible. Getting out requires a North Korea-style exit permit. Border closures have separated families and caused untold hardship. Babies have died, unable to access urgent medical attention at the nearest hospital across a locked state border. Thousands of holiday-makers who were travelling when border closures were imposed have been made homeless, some having to sleep in cars or live for months in refugee-style campsites, unable to return home even if they are double vaccinated. Some have been prevented from visiting dying relatives in other cities. Yet state leaders have held firm, only lifting interstate bans for celebrities and sports stars.Many abroad envy Australians, believing we have escaped the worst of the pandemic, but the true cost of our lockdown policy is yet to be fully understood. While deaths have remained low, other metrics paint a disastrous picture. Psychologists and GPs report a surge in substance abuse, eating disorders, domestic and child abuse, truancy, depression, anxiety and self-harm. Even high vaccine uptake may not protect the most vulnerable from Covid let alone the other illnesses that could ravage Australia due to the “immunity debt” caused by much lower exposure to other viruses.While Sydney opens up, some states are still pursuing doomed zero-Covid policies. The irony is that flights between Sydney and London will resume long before Australians can travel freely within their own country.Megan Goldin is the author of ‘The Night Swim’ and ‘Stay Awake’More from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersWanted: a National Trust leader who can be trusted to love its heritage all over againIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Working class accent seen as sign of being ‘less intelligent’, study findsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed schools get pupils every russell group university","story":"When parents are deciding which school to send their child to, there are a number of factors they will want to consider.

I am determined we continue to deliver on these opportunities, working with allies and partners around the world in support of the Government objectives.”Vice Adml Key, who has also held the position of Fleet Commander, joined the Navy in 1984 as a university cadet, where he graduated with a degree in physics from Royal Holloway, University of London.He qualified as both helicopter aircrew and as a Principal Warfare Officer, and has seen service around the world in a variety of frigates and destroyers.Throughout his career, he has commanded four ships, including the mine hunter HMS Sandown, the frigates HMS Iron Duke and HMS Lancaster, and the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious.Defence sources added that while the recent Operation Pitting raised Vice Adml Key’s profile, in his two-and-a-half years as Chief of Joint Operations he had worked through “many crises and enduring operations around the world”.They said: “What he’s done during that time is understand in much more detail how defence needs to adapt and change, and better integrate to meet the threats in the future. He’s certainly got a much clearer idea now of how the Navy can better contribute to defence’s challenges, so I think that that would have been very compelling to the Defence Secretary.” Vice Adml Key, who lives with his wife Elly and three children in Dorset, is a Freeman of the City of London and a Younger Brother of Trinity House.

It will be its first real (as opposed to virtual) AGM since Covid. The intervening period has been the most troubled in the Trust’s history, so the meeting ought to be an occasion for frank self-examination at the top.The current signs are that it will not be. The Trust management has decided to bristle angrily against critics rather than trying to improve good will. This week, an NT spokesman told the  that it was under attack by “paid-for campaigns that back candidates with ideologies opposed to our values”.This was a pointlessly aggressive way to refer to the new grass-roots organisation, Restore Trust. Restore Trust (RT) is explicitly committed to restoring the values which founded the National Trust – the conservation, for the public, of “places of historic interest or natural beauty” – hence its name. To this end, it is endorsing some candidates for the NT’s Council and advancing some resolutions for the AGM. (Voting by members not attending the AGM closes on 22 October: all you need to vote online is your membership number.) RT would not exist at all if there were not widespread disillusionment with the way the NT is being run.The plague from Wuhan created genuine, enormous problems for the NT: what do you do if the public are not allowed to visit the houses and gardens you hold in trust for them? But instead of simply getting on with a programme of necessary retrenchment, the Trust allowed ideology to run riot.First, an internal report was leaked attacking the “outdated mansion experience” (what you or I would call the careful conservation of beautiful country houses). Next, the “interim” report of NT properties’ links with slavery and “colonialism” was published, creating controversy by its poor scholarship and its judgemental character. Winston Churchill was one of its prominent victims. It also emerged that a “Colonial Countryside Project” was in progress. This took parties of young schoolchildren round NT properties to tell them how wicked the former owners (often donors, too) had been, inviting them to write poems denouncing them.As public anxiety spread, many related discontents surfaced. The redundancy programme, partly inevitable because of Covid, seemed to many members of staff to be targeted against older, more knowledgeable employees who did not conform to “ersity” criteria. Curators, the traditional mainstay of conservation scholarship about Trust properties, were cut. The Trust denies this, pointing out that curator numbers have increased. The RT response is that this is largely a sleight of hand, since employees previously called “Visitor Experience Consultants” have been rebranded as “Experiences and Partnerships Curators”, with no increase in expertise.As for the far more numerous NT volunteers – the unpaid labour whom the visiting public meet much more often than the staff – these have been fiercely reduced and, some of them claim, rudely treated by management. One of the RT-backed resolutions at the AGM complains that volunteers have not been properly consulted before changes take place. The NT’s legalistic defence is that consultation would create obligations to them under employment law. Surely, if there were a will, the NT could find a way through that one.The unease echoes in the membership, which has fallen markedly (despite renewal discounts) since Covid. The phrase “National Trust” has in the past been taken to mean what it says. Members have trusted the organisation. Less so now. Interpretations, gimmicks and “experiences” seem to have taken over from faithful care of the original houses, gardens, landscapes and farms. Respect for the spirit of place, so essential for such a erse heritage, seems to have been replaced by that of a cross between a didactic museum and a kiddies’ theme-park.Stourhead in Wiltshire, for example, is a world-famous example of 18th-century classical style and craftsmanship, in furniture as well as architecture. Yet if you enter its hall today, the first thing that confronts you, blocking the vista to the next room, is a large white cube. One of its faces asks, “Why do objects matter?” Another lists possible objects which the Trust thinks might matter to the visitor, such as “the apron he cooks in” and “That magnet you bought in Barcelona”. On top of the cube lie several objects, including a globe, a teapot and a quill pen. Even if I had ever bought a magnet in Barcelona, or worn a cook’s apron, how would this intrusive display enhance my understanding of Stourhead?Something similar happens in gardens, often crowded with instructions saying, “Catch your breath” (Glendurgan, Cornwall), “How has Nature helped you connect?” (also Stourhead) or “Slow your pace and enjoy the place” (generic).The interventions can be magnificently unhistorical. At Croome Court, Worcestershire, a mansion with a Capability Brown garden, some Trust showman heard recently that in 1760, the then owner, Lord Coventry, had demolished the cottages of his tenants next to his new house, and evicted them. A pretend 18th-century protest was organised for the edification of visitors: NT employees marched with placards saying, “Down with Lord Coventry!” Coming across this parade by chance, the Coventry family archivist felt compelled to point out that Lord C had actually knocked down his tenants’ houses to build them better ones. The NT pageant revealed the prejudices – and the ignorance – of those involved.Amidst assorted troubles, the NT chairman, Tim Parker, resigned this summer, embroiled in the scandal of the unjust imprisonment of sub-postmasters at the behest of the Post Office, of which he is also chairman. So now there is a vacancy. Applications closed this week.The appointment process for a new NT chairman makes the election of the Pope look transparent. Britain’s largest membership organisation gives no say whatever to the members, welcoming their money but not their opinions. Its Nominations Committee selects, in secret, one candidate and the Council then approves whoever that may be. There is little chance, therefore, that the existing establishment will cede power to any challenger. Rumour suggests Sandy Nairne, a member of the NT Council and former director of the National Portrait Gallery, and the current (two-term) deputy chairman Orna NiChionna, a businesswoman, as candidates. Both are able people, but both are implicated in what has gone wrong.A prominent outsider candidate has come forward at the last minute. Rory Stewart, the writer, traveller, and former government minister, is a dark horse and a lone wolf – if one can be two animals at once – so I cannot place him in any faction. But his commitment to our country’s built heritage and land stewardship (the Trust owns 600,000 acres) is real. I have direct experience of his conservation skills because I visited him in Afghanistan. There, against every possible disadvantage of war, filth and poverty, he had cleared the rubbish which had buried the old city of Kabul, restoring eight acres of old buildings, streets and courtyards and filling them, via his Turquoise Mountain charity, with revived Afghan crafts and workshops. It was about the only Western initiative in that country which succeeded. Rory seemed to love conservation and to know how it can enhance modern life.I fear it is the lack of love for the NT’s historic collections, buildings and gardens which is most disheartening about the current leadership. The members feel that love, though, and will respond warmly to leaders who share it. Restoration and reconciliation can be accomplished, but only with urgent change.More from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Working class accent seen as sign of being ‘less intelligent’, study findsSir David Amess, in pictures: The distinguished life of the Southend West MPMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"working class accent seen sign less intelligent study finds","story":"Working class people are judged 14 per cent less intelligent simply because of their accent, a study has revealed.They are also rated four per cent less friendly and five per cent less trustworthy, according to research which asked participants to rate people on a sliding scale based solely on how they spoke.People from Essex were judged on average 11 per cent less intelligent than those from south-west London. And women were evaluated as being two per cent less intelligent than men but five per cent more friendly and trustworthy than men.The research by Dr Amanda Cole, an Essex University academic and postdoctoral research fellow at the Institute for Analytics and Data Science – tested the link between the way we speak and perceptions of class on nearly 200 people.The participants, aged between 18 and 33, were played 10-second audio clips of other young people reading the same sentence. The clips were of more than 100 people from across London and the South East without being told anything about their background. Both the speakers and respondents had each been asked to self-rate their class as “lower-working,” “upper-working,” “lower-middle,” “upper-middle,” or “upper”, while researchers also collected data about age, gender and where they lived.The most extreme differences were illustrated by two white female speakers from Essex who lived just 1.5 miles apart. They received mean perceived intelligence scores of 70 per cent and 29 per cent.The former lives in an affluent area, attended a fee-paying school, is university educated, and identified herself as lower-middle class. The latter is from a council estate, attended state school, did not attain any further education and identified herself as lower-working class.Those who considered themselves to be lower-working class judged the higher classes as more intelligent and as speaking more correctly. Lower working-class respondents evaluated other lower-working class speakers on average as 48.2 per cent intelligent, compared to their judgement of upper-middle class speakers as 63.3 per cent intelligent.Dr Cole said: “This is deeply unfair. When some people speak, regardless of the clarity or weight of their words, they are seen as less intelligent, friendly or trustworthy than other people. “Accent bias is a mirror of societal biases. It is propping up class prejudice, racial inequality, gender stereotypes and cliched ideas of people from certain areas.“In Britain, many people still subscribe to the mindset that a few limited ways of speaking English (such as the \u0027Queen’s English\u0027, which is at the extreme) are legitimate and correct while others aren’t. “Even if many regional dialects are considered quaint or fun, they are also often judged to be a rejection or rebellion against \u0027correct\u0027 English or a reflection of poor education.”More from NewsCounter-terror probe launched into killer of MP Sir David AmessSir David Amess\u0026#39s dependability proved to be his vulnerabilityExclusive: \u0026#39Hero\u0026#39 police officer tells how he was shot by Norway killer - but kept working to save othersWanted: a National Trust leader who can be trusted to love its heritage all over againIan Maxwell: ‘Court of public opinion has already convicted my sister Ghislaine, but she is innocent’Sir David Amess, in pictures: The distinguished life of the Southend West MPMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"after david amess jo cox","story":"After David Amess, as with Jo Cox killing, we must never allow violence and hate to winMy friend Jo Cox was murdered in  and since then her family and friends have made an extraordinary effort to bring communities together – David Amess was known for his personal kindness and that must be at the heart of the legacy of this latest horrorthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video david-amess-kim-leadbeater-says-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:fTliOg,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An MP killed in his constituency. A father-of-three this time, popular amongst MPs of all parties and known for his kindness in the House, murdered just doing his job. All good MPs understand that constituency work is why they are in office. It’s where they see the mum with the disabled child who needs to be rehoused, or the dad whose benefits have been cut, and where elderly folk come to chat over tea and a hobnob. It’s where MPs meet ‘real people’, unfiltered by aides or interest groups. It’s where democracy is enacted.  But it’s more than that too. Constituency work is where our representative democracy is seen to happen, the human interface between an anonymous ‘X’ on a ballot paper and actual power. New safety measures are needed to keep MPs safe, but they must fall short of locking MPs behind glass. Not only would this allow violence to triumph, it would also heighten the growing distance and disdain ordinary people feel for politicians.

On social media, in our everyday interactions, in what we publish or say in Parliament. We have to learn to disagree better. For a moment, watching the news break, like many others who knew Jo Cox better than me, I was back watching the England-Wales game in , seeing a text message that an MP had been shot and stabbed in Birstall. I knew that meant only one thing, my friend Jo.  What has happened since has been an extraordinary effort by her family and friends to work to bring communities together – including our own project Britain Talks. Even among those who, like me, disagreed with David’s views, he was known for his personal kindness. I know that those who loved David will want, in the coming months, to build a positive legacy in his name. Kindness must be at the heart of that legacy. For democracy to , violence can never, ever win.

She became an internet sensation in February over a leaked video of her trying to referee a fractious gathering of Handforth Parish Council in Cheshire. One member told her: “You have no authority here, Jackie Weaver” - prompting web mirth during the third national lockdown. Now, Ms Weaver has thrown her support behind a Compassion in Politics petition to ban lying in politics. The think-tank’s plan, revealed by the Mirror earlier this year, would overhaul existing laws governing the marketing of goods and apply them to statements made by politicians. What do you think of the petition  Have your say in the comment section  A ,-signature petition will be handed to the Government on Wednesday. Ms Weaver said: “Working in politics, I’ve seen just how much damage dishonesty can do. “It makes it impossible to create policies based on evidence, it creates toxicity and ision, it destroys trust in the political process. “We don’t tolerate it in any other places of work - why should we tolerate it in politics   “This new law would create a very clear line in the sand - stating once and for all that lies and misrepresentation will not be tolerated in a decent, democratic society.” In a video message, she adds: “You have the power. Dare I say it  You have the authority.” Compassion in Politics co-director Jenner Nadel said: “Any political system which allows politicians to lie with impunity is not fit for purpose.  “There are laws against lying in other areas of le but none in politics - and that needs to change. “You can’t lie when selling a car so why should anyone be allowed to lie when presenting policies or reporting on government activity ” Green MP Caroline Lucas, who is backing the bid, said a “healthy democracy needs honest leaders”. She added: “We cannot hold politicians to account when they lie, misrepresent and spin the facts, we cannot have open and honest debates based on fake news and  information, we cannot hope to make good policy from bad facts.”  The Mirror told in May how % of voters would back the introduction of a new law to make it a crime for politicians to deliberately lie. Support for the move was weakest among Lib Dem supporters, with % giving it their approval.Backing was highest among Labour voters, % of whom wanted new legislation creating the offence, while % of Tory voters were supportive. Just three per cent of , people quizzed online by Opinium opposed the idea – the same proportion who believed politicians routinely tell the truth. Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru have drafted legislation which the party plans to table in Parliament later this year. Under the proposal, which is unlikely to become law without Government support, offenders found guilty could face an unlimited fine or two-year jail terms. Plaid’s Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: “This law is urgently needed to ensure rogue politicians are held to account.” She added: “Accountability lies at the heart of democracy, it is the foundation of trust in government. “But current rules allow politicians to undermine that trust by running fast and loose with the truth, with no consequences.” Comment MORE ON Liberal DemocratsConservative PartyJackie WeaverCaroline LucasViralPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Government has insisted it has already learned lessons from the pandemic. Ministers have also pointed to a public inquiry due to begin next spring. Critics want it to start immediately. Health Secretary Sajid Javid, who took up the role in June after Matt Hancock was forced to resign for breaking social distancing rules during an affair with his aide, was asked todayhe was sorry for failures which occurred.He said: “Yes, of course I’m sorry. “Obviously I am new in the role, but on behalf of the Government I am sorry for, during the pandemic, anyone that suffered, especially anyone that lost a loved one, a mother, a dad, a brother, a sister, a friend. Of course I am sorry for that.  “Also, all those people that may not have lost someone but they are still suffering - there are many people sadly suffering from long Covid, we still don’t know the impact of that. Of course I am. “There will be lessons to learn from this pandemic for this Government, for governments across the world, there will be lessons. It is important that is done. “There is going to be a public inquiry and I think that is the best place to learn these lessons.” Asked later what mistakes he was apologising for, he said: “I don’t know all the lessons that we are going to have to learn about this - I don’t think anyone does at this point. “I think the best place to determine those will be the independent public inquiry.” Comment MORE ON Keir StarmerPoliticsTory GovernmentCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They invited Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove to meet them in Liverpool in January.The offer came as the Convention of the North and the NP group of northern local enterprise partnerships published their demands in a -page blueprint, ‘The North’s leveling-up  Net Zero Partnership Offer’. Leading a “green” Industrial Revolution and closing the le expectancy gap between the North and South are among issues where action should be taken, according to the document. Efforts to narrow the education and skills ide and improve transport links across the North are also areas which need tackling, according to the plan.  Liverpool City RegionMayor Steve Rotheram said: True leveling-up has to mean tackling longstanding and structural inequalities that exist between North and South in this country on a wide range of issues, from healthcare and job prospects, to transport and infrastructure spending. “This is not an issue of party politics but one of fairness and social justice. “As leaders representing millions of people across the North, we want to work with government to make that a reality. “The North has been hit harder than the rest of the country, but I believe that with proper support we also have the potential to bounce back further and faster than the rest of the country too.” West YorkshireMayor Tracy Brabin described the plans as a powerful statement of northernersapos desire to get on with the job of leveling-up, working together across the North and with government. She added: Through a clear focus on our leveling-up priorities of health, skills, transport, innovation and leading the transition to net zero, we can deliver an inclusive, productive, sustainable economy that works for all northerners and for the country.  Convention of the North chairman Nick Forbes, the Newcastle City Council leader said: ““The country as a whole has suffered enormously during the course of the Covid- pandemic and the North of England, with its rich heritage and ambitions for the future, is poised to play a leading role in the national recovery. “But we need to create lasting, purposeful partnerships to achieve this, and key to that is winning the full backing of central Government.” A Department for Levelling-Up, Housing and Communities spokesman said: “Levelling-up the North means empowering local leaders, boosting living standards, spreading opportunity, improving public services and regenerating our town centres and high streets. “The Secretary of State is looking forward to working with the Convention of the North and the NP group to deliver for communities across the north and would be delighted to meet with them in January.” Comment MORE ON Michael GoveGas pricesLe expectancyLiving standardsPublic servicesThe economyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Is the Queen a secret radical Leftie Her Majestys long reign has probably produced more carbon dioxide than any of her subjects, says Fleet Street Fox. But shes turning into a bit of a hippy in her old ageopinionByFleet Street FoxColumnist:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsIn general, any -year-old dripping in jewellery that costs more than the average house will, when discussing climate change, state that it is someone aposs problem. And so it was when the Queen attended the opening of the Welsh Senedd, wearing pearl earrings the size of a mint humbug, shortly before stepping into a Kevlar-plated limousine to drive a single, solitary mile to the station where her personal train awaited her.She was caught on a livestream discussing the upcoming COP climate change summit, saying: Extraordinary isnapost it... still donapost know whoaposs coming, no idea... we only know about people who are not coming and itaposs really irritating when they talk, but donapost do.She might have meant it was irritating when guests donapost reply to invitations, but most people have taken it as a broad criticism of world leaders failing to save the planet.   Seeing as this is a woman whose homes contain a large amount of the planet that was mined, carved, shot, skinned, robbed or stolen before it was squirrelled away for her and her family, you might reasonably conclude itaposs a bit rich for her to criticise. But she has done rather more than most of her Prime Ministers to de-carbonise the country. Buckingham Palace has heat and hot water produced by a combined heat and power plant, with solar  in the offing. Windsor Castle boasts hydroelectric power fed by the River Thames, while Balmoral produces  tonnes of compost every year from its organic waste. She also sends old staff computers to be recycled, and redistributed by charities in the developing world.A quarter of the UKaposs power comes from wind turbines, a vast number of which are on offshore farms she technically owns, and which are leased from the Crown Estate. Sheaposs patron of  environmental charities, her husband had more than , and their eldest son has a -year-old car which has an engine converted to run on wine and cheese.Aside from the fact thataposs the automobile version of Boris Johnson, itaposs more than anyoneaposs done to make  Downing Street any greener. In fact, the real-time website displaying the PMaposs energy use is currently kaput. On the same day she was caught making a snfy remark about the Chinese refusal to come to the environmental party, climate activist Greta Thunberg said COP would involve many pledges that -you look into the details - are more or less meaningless but they just say them in order to have something to say, in order for media to have something to report about.And so there are two uncomfortable things to consider. The first is that,the Chinese donapost turn up, there is no chance the rest of the world could limit global warming to an extra . degrees. Islands will be lost to melted ice caps, species will go extinct, and mass immigrations will take place, all because Xi Jinping is too much of a capitalist.The second is that Her Majesty might be a secret hippy. An unco-operative crusty. A friend of Swampy. A hippy-dippy, namby-pamby, ooh-itaposs-all-got-to-be-a-bit-green, woke old greenhouse whinger.Read more The evidence for: . Sells own chutney outside house . Always carrying a bunch of flowers . Finds money unnecessary And against: OH COME ON.The woman has  gas-guzzling limousines,  private homes, another  she uses for work, two jets, three helicopters, a train, and had to have her diesel-powered yacht prised out of her hands. In , it was calculated she had travelled more than a million miles, equivalent to going around the world  times, in the course of her reign. And thataposs before you calculate the cost to the planet of  children,  grandchildren, and  great-grandchildren, not one of whom is ever going to catch the bus.Throw in the fact sheaposs a widow living in single-glazed, drafty palaces, with hundreds of bedrooms, and thousands of staff, all consuming water and electricity just because she canapost find her own cornflakes in the morning, and Queen Elizabeth II has a bigger carbon footprint than a T-Rex in a coal mine. Itaposs no good saying but she goes around switching the lights off. Thereaposd be a lot more light to go round,she hadnapost bothered to give us Prince Andrew.  But you canapost be a totally green Queen, whatever Meghan Markle might think. A Royal simply isnapost royal any morethey ditch the palaces, staff, and multiple forms of transport. Brenda from down the road might be able to hop on the bus to get to Sainsburyaposs, but Brenda from SWA is going to struggle with it. The Royal travel, state visits, and constant wardrobe changes are part of a job no-one wants to say is surplus to requirements. Staff, security, consumption, and the problems of maintaining ,-year-old castles are something she cannot do much about.Itaposs not like sheaposs about to live in a tunnel under Finsbury Square, or block the M in rush hour while daring a lorry driver to drag her onto the hard shoulder, and shouting SOD THE AMBULANCES!But one of the benefits of a Queen is being able to get her to say or do things that are accidentally overheard but entirely intended, like when David Cameron asked her to intervene in the Scottish independence referendum, or a politician not a million miles from Michael Gove lied that she was pro-Leave, and next chance she got the Queen dressed up as the EU flag to put him back in his box.  Thataposs why it was her name on the COP invitations. Itaposs why her being irritated will be reported worldwide. Itaposs why, perhaps, shamefaced world leaders will suddenly respond to a summit invitation they had hitherto ignored. Queens have power, and old ladies can tickle even the least-guilty conscience with just the tiniest hint of disapproval. Anyone who thinks they havenapost been naughty will start to wonderin fact they have. Those who think the world has forgotten what they did, will be reminded the world should remember what theyaposll do next. The most ardent republican feels the knee creak into a curtsey, when this particular woman asks how far youaposve come. Whether her words were planned or accidental, they will do more than all the Prime Ministeraposs windbaggery to actually move world leaders closer to common sense. That she can do that is the reason we let her get away with everything .Hopefully at the summit sheaposll get the chance to say well, one SHOULD insulate Britain, shouldnapost one  Seeing as she loathed Margaret Thatcher, married a refugee and is literally the head of a union, sheaposs probably more of a radical Leftie than anyone will ever realise.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Xi JinpingThe QueenBoris JohnsonBuckingham PalaceCrown EstateEnergyRoyal FamilyClimate changeJewelleryPoliticsSolar power\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

My orders would always be enough to feed two people as I would have extra sides and dessert. Iaposd have a large pizza with chicken wings and cookies for £ - sometimes twice per week. Alex reckons each takeaway would cost between £ and £ and sheaposd buy six per week - on top of £ already spent on her food shop. She admits she had an addiction to food and often snacked in the evening.  She said: I really struggled with portion sizes and have since I was quite young. My mum is a chef so she used to feed us really healthy food, but the portions would always be quite large, and I donapost knowthataposs where the weight spanned from. I started to become really uncomfortable with myself and walking up the stairs became a daily struggle. Determined to sht the weight on her own, Alex went to her GP for advice, tried several dferent exercise regimes and even hired a personal trainer but nothing worked. Due to her size and the fact she suffers from polycystic oy syndrome , Alex was terried she might not be able to have kids. She added: I tried everything to lose weight, I didnapost want weight loss surgery to be my only option. But at most, I only managed to lose two or three stones and I couldnapost seem to lose any more than that. After seemingly trying everything, Alex realised weight loss surgery was the best option for her and opted to have a gastric sleeve operation. The procedure cuts away about % of the stomach to drastically reduce how much a person can eat before feeling full. Before being eligible for the operation on the NHS, Alex had to sht five per cent of her weight and maintain it for a year.After the operation, Alex was determined to eat more healthily in the hope of starting fertility treatment with her partner Danielle, . Sheaposs also documented her journey on her Instagram page, @sleeve-me-to-fix-itSince ditching the takeaway habit and buying healthy food, Alex feels better than ever and is saving a fortune. She said: I look back at what I used to eat, and I just canapost stomach that type of food anymore, the portions are just too big.Have you had an incredible body transformation  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcMy friends and family were dubious about me having the surgery.

The -year-old monarch described the situation as irritating when talking about the leadersapos seemingly laissez-faire attitude to the summit.

The royals normally stay clear of political opinions, but many people have praised Her Majesty for expressing her frustration. Her comment is far from the first time a member of The Firm has been caught making a comment that has raised eyebrows. Charlesaposs jibe at BBC reporter While on holiday in the Swiss Alps with sons William and Harry in , Prince Charles accidentally let slip his true feelings for BBC royal reporter, Nicholas Witchell. Surrounded by reporters asking questions about Charlesaposs upcoming wedding to Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles appeared to lose his patience. After the reporter asked him how he felt about his nuptials, Charles said: Iaposm very glad you heard of it anyway. Then, under his breath and with a grimace, he said: Bloody people. I canapost bear that man. Heaposs so awful. He really is. Although said in a quieter tone, itaposs impossible to knowCharles intended for his comment to be heard - he did have dozens of microphones on him, after all. Row with Russia On a trip to Canada in , Prince Charles ruffled feathers once more when he compared Russian president Vladimir Putin to Adolf Hitler. The comment came about while he chatted to a -year-old Jewish woman who had fled from Poland during World War Two The Daily Mail reported the heir to the throne said: “Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler.” The alleged comments sparked a furious response from Moscow, with a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry accusing him and the British press of a smear campaign. The spokesman said: “We view the use of the Western press by members of the British royal family to spread the propaganda campaign against Russia on a pressing issue - that is, the situation in Ukraine - as unacceptable, outrageous and low.” Anneaposs Olympics gaffe Princess Anne made history when she became the first British royal to compete in the Olympic games in Montreal, .  After her equestrian success, she was an integral part of Londonaposs bid to host the  Olympics and is said to have put everything into making sure it was named host city for that year. But she made a serious error in the lead up to the games, which could have landed her in hot water. Sebastian Coe revealed in a documentary about Anneaposs le that she made a rude comment about a fellow committee member, forgetting her microphone was still switched on.

Early years Prince Andrew and Sarah had been friends since they were children but it wasnapost until  that they started dating after being seated together at Royal Ascot that year.They got engaged nine months later on February ,  - his th birthday - and Andrew gave his we-to-be a ruby engagement ring. Their wedding was a grand affair at Westminster Abbey and they shared a kiss on the balcony of Buckingham Palace like Prince Charles and Princess Diana before them. In the early days of their romance, Fergie bonded with the Queen over their shared love of horses, according to Vanity Fair.It was also reported that she won over Prince Philip with her sharp sense of humour and the interest she showed in her father-in-lawaposs favourite sport of carriage driving.Split from Andrew Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up.After their wedding, the couple welcomed two daughters - Princess Beatrice in  and Princess Eugenie in .But cracks had begun to appear in their relationship as Andrewaposs naval career saw him away from the family for long periods of time. And in  they split with their orce finalised in . Speaking to US TV host Ernie Manouse in , Sarah spoke about palace courtiers, who she said made her le dficult. She explained: “My deal was that I was marrying my man, who happened to be a prince and a naval officer. “But what I got was not the man, I got the palace and didn’t get him... and the courtiers told me I had to go to Buckingham Palace and he had to go to sea. “For our marriage, I saw him  days a year.” Livid royals  Despite splitting from Andrew, Fergie was still invited to join the family for their traditional summer holiday in Balmoral in . However, the politeness disappeared on one excruciatingly embarrassing moment when intimate photos of her appeared on the front pages. She had been snapped having her toes sucked by her financial advisor, Texan millionaire John Bryan. Other photos in the set also showed the couple kissing, embracing and frolicking in the pool and they appeared in newspapers.And while at Balmoral, Fergie had to walk into breakfast that morning while the family all looked at the pictures. Speaking on Channel aposs documentary, Fergie Vs Diana: Royal Wives at War, royal expert Jennie Bond said: There she was, with all the members of the royal family, who traditionally have all the papers laid out on the breakfast table. The scene when she went into the dining room was horrendous because there were her brothers-in-law turning over the pages and staring at her naked top half of her body. It was excruciatingly embarrassing and she went to the Queen, and the Queen was livid. She was absolutely furious with Sarah. Prince Philip rt  One royal who was said to be especially furious with the toe sucking pictures was the late Prince Philip.His biographer Gyles Brandreth once said Philip thought Sarah was simply beyond the pale and gave her a wide berthBrandreth claimed the Duke of Edinburgh decided that aposenough was enoughapos and that he didnapost want anything more to do with her.He told MailOnline : When I asked him [Prince Philip] why he wouldn’t see Sarah, he said: ‘I am not vindictive.’Then, looking at me directly, he added emphatically: ‘I am not vindictive, but I don’t see the point.’ The pair are said to have not met for  years, with Fergie banished from ­Balmoral each summer before Philip arrived. Diana feud It wasnapost just Prince Philip that Sarah stopped talking to - she also had a falling out with her friend Princess Diana.In the early years of their marriages, Diana and Fergie had a close bond. They were often pictured chatting at events, such as Ascot, and took their children on skiing holidays together with Fergie frequently describing Diana as her best friend. But itaposs thought that in  the pairaposs relationship became strained and at the time of Dianaaposs tragic death a year later, they were not on speaking terms.According to the Daily Mail, the reason stemmed back to Sarahaposs autobiography, My Story, released in .Before it was published, Diana is reported to have told her former sister-in-law not to include any gossip about her in it. But Sarah included an unflattering anecdote, saying she got a verruca after wearing a pair of shoes she borrowed from Diana - causing the rt. William wedding snub In , Fergie was snubbed from the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after being unceremoniously left off the guest list.The wedding came a year after she was caught up in a sting set up by a journalist in which she appeared to ask for and accept , in cash in exchange for access to her ex-husband Prince Andrew.Speaking to Town and Country Magazine she said: I didn’t think I was probably worthy to go to their wedding. I took myself to Thailand, actually, to be far away from it so that I could try and heal.”But she bore no ill will towards her nephew William and said previously: I think Diana would be so proud of her son... I really love the feeling that Diana and I both werenapost there. Harryaposs invitationHowever, by the time Williamaposs younger brother Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in , the tide had begun to turn.And Fergie did bag an invite to the big day - marking ato the royal fold. In later years, she of course took her place alongside he royals at the weddings of Beatrice and Eugenie. Balmoral Despite Fergieaposs frosty relationship with Prince Philip, she is said to have remained on good terms with the Queen. And this year she appeared to be back in the royal inner circle by spending time with Her Majesty and other royals at Balmoral. According to royal expert Angela Levin, this made Fergie happy and feel assheaposs back in the crowd. Praise for the Queen And showing her gratitude to the Queen, Sarah has given her some high praise indeed. Speaking on the Tea with Twiggy podcast earlier this year, she said she admires the way Her Majesty is so modern and flexible. She said: I think to myself that honestly my mother-in-law has been more of a mother to me than my mother. I absolutely think there is no greater mentor because from a little girl to now, the consistency of Her Majesty has been a great honour and makes me want to cry.

The man, whose identity has not been made public, was held in a darkened room and fed sporadically, the Carabinieri police said. He was able to use some kind of code to tell his family he was being held hostage while calling them with the ransom request, it has been reported. They then contacted the police who located the -year-old in Monte San Giusto, near the city of Macerata in central Italy,  hours later. On Wednesday afternoon Italian police said they surrounded the apartment of the alleged kidnappers - who had demanded €,for his release - before safely securing the Brit.  Yesterday the Italian force said that the young man had been on holiday in Italy when he was kidnapped. Three of his alleged kidnappers were Italian, while the fourth was Moroccan. They were reportedly arrested and remanded in custody in a prison near the city of Ancona. The young manaposs release was secured via a joint operation between the Carabinieri and the National Crime Agency. It is unclear why the amount of money demanded was relatively small, given the wealth of the British manaposs family.His family, who are fairly wealthy, received a message from him and contacted the British police and the NCA, who in turn contacted the Carabinieri, Colonel Nicola Candido, who was also involved in the operation, said, thereported. Within  hours, we had located the apartment in which he was being held prisoner. The raid took place at  on Wednesday. We surrounded the apartment block, arrested the captors, and released the hostage. The British man had been in Italy since June, he said. Colonel Massimiliano Mengasini, who was also involved in the operation, said the man was found in a darkened room with furniture pushed up against the wall. The man was exhausted but slowly recovering, he added. Sean Kelly, operations manager for the NCA’s Anti Kidnap and Extortion Unit , said: “We have been working closely with the Italian authorities since the kidnap of a British man was reported. “NCA officers in Italy and specialists from AKEU, working together with UK policing, have been providing close support to the Carabinieri Police as part of its ongoing investigation. “We are pleased that this incident has been resolved successfully.”  Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Crime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Le is tough on Unst, Britain’s most northerly inhabited island, but it could soon become the site of Britain’s first venture into space from its own territory. Ready for blast-off...Mirrorman Martin Fricker stands on the proposed launch site area Image: Jonathan BuckmasterByMartin Fricker:,  Oct | commentsWise-crackers on a remote Scottish island set to be the new Cape Canaveral have already come up with a slogan: “One wee step for man, one giant leap for McMankind”. Unst, Britain’s most northerly inhabited island, is closer to Norway than Aberdeen and home to fewer than . It has one pub, one hotel, one school, three shops, a lone bus route and no police station or hospital. Located further north than Moscow, sheep outnumber locals and the nearest railway station is in Bergen, Norway. Here le is tough, with an average temperature of C, near-constant gales and just five hours of winter daylight. Yet Unst could soon become the site of Britain’s first venture into space from its own territory. Have your say on this story in the comment section Edinburgh rocket company Skyrora announced this week it had signed a deal to launch satellites from the former Saxa Vord radar base on the island. It wants to send its -metre -ton XL rocket into space from  with up to  launches a year by . Crucially, the SaxaVord Spaceport is expected to create  jobs locally. Not surprisingly it is the talk of the island. At its peak in , during the herring boom, Unst had a population of , but its fortunes declined with the closure of the radar early warning station in .  Hundreds lost their jobs and left the island, creating a knock-on effect for the local economy.In the “capital”, Baltasound, two miles from Saxa Vord, Victoria Mouat, , runs Victoria’s VintageTea Rooms.She moved to Unst  years ago from her native Devon and hopes the spaceport will bring in much-needed trade. She said: “When I first arrived here the island was thriving, thanks to the RAF. “There were social events and re- gattas. There was even an Oktoberfest. “But when the base shut people left in droves, especially young families. “We have an ageing population so I’m really willing the spaceport to succeed because it should bring in new families.”  The mum of four went on: “In summer this is the greatest place on earth. We have hardly any crime and most of us leave our doors unlocked. I genuinely don’t know where my door key is. “But it’s a dferent story in winter. After October we hardly see any visitors.“The weather is bad and it’s only light from am to pm. I just hope it doesn’t put people off coming to work here.“Our northerly location is our claim to fame now but being home to the UK spaceport is even bigger. It’s so exciting.”  Unst, which measures  miles by three, may not boast Cape Canaveral’s tropical climate but it does have one crucial thing in common – its isolation and a “clear run” to space. Rockets must be launched away from urban areas and cannot overfly towns, villages or even oil rigs. From Unst they can head directly north over the Arctic Circle before leaving the earth’s atmosphere. Its northern latitude also means more satellites pass overhead than anywhere  on earth, making it an ideal spot for downloading data from space. At Unst’s only pub, the Balta Light, barmaid Yvonne Thomson, , is confident the spaceport will boost the local economy. She said: “It will bring in the tourists and they will be looking for somewhere to drink. Anything that attracts more visitors is a good thing. “In the longer term, new employees will be bringing their children here which means the school can survive.”  At first sight it is hard to believe Saxa Vord will be launching rockets in a matter of months. New US and Scottish flags fly alongside shiny plastic signs announcing the futuristic site is “under construction”. But just feet away, sheep wander in the howling wind and drizzle through what remains of the RAF base. However, spaceport boss Frank Strang insists plans for a  launch remain on track. The former RAF pilot said: “I’m % confident the first UK orbital launch will take off here next year.” The country-music-loving entrepreneur admits that at first glance Unst is an unlikely frontrunner in the new space race. But plans are in hand for an eco-resort to house visitors and scientists coming to the spaceport.  Get all the latest news straight to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters The -year-old said: “When I first mooted the idea with the local council they thought it was an April Fool. “People of my age think of the old space race but we’re now in the new space race where satellites the size of a teapot cost as little as £,. “On average we all use satellites  times a day in our everyday lives, from cashpoints to mobile phones to GPS. “The UK is ideally placed to be a frontrunner in the new space race and Unst is the perfect spot.” Surprisingly, Frank says there are as many weather windows to launch on the island as there are at sunny Cape Canaveral. “You need a three-hour window of winds under  knots,” he said.“We looked at Met Office data going back a decade and it showed that in spring and autumn we have those windows on % of days. The first rocket is due to be launched from Lamba Ness, a bird-watching spot a mile from the tiny settlement of Haroldswick. Access is via a single-track road where sheep and Shetland ponies wander freely. But plans are under way to build a new road to accommodate the cranes and lorries that carry the rockets. In a reassuring sign of the times, the spaceport is also aiming to be the world’s greenest launch site. Skyrora plans to fuel its rockets with Ecosene, which is made from waste-plastic, preventing more than , tons of un-recyclable plastic going to landfill by . As we leave Unst on the ferry, mph winds howl across the hills and the rain is horizontal as the first early winter storm of  blasts in. It begs the question: Will  really be the year this remote outpost goes up, Unst and away  Just watch this space.

The loving father had been tormented for more than a decade by the horrendous murder of his daughter, Meredith - with key questions surrounding the infamous case remaining unanswered to this day. In January last year, the -year-old died in hospital after being found in the road near his Croydon home with two fractured legs, a broken arm and a head injury.In yet another cruel blow to his family, this week a coroner said he was unable to sayJohn was killed in a hit-and-run - with police unable to establish why he was on the road.In a book about Meredithaposs murder, the grief-stricken dad spoke movingly about the stark possibility the Kerchers may never know what happened in her final hours. This is how the family was rocked by the murder trial and subsequent acquittal that made headlines around the world - and why they have a complicated relationship with Meredithaposs exonerated flatmate, Amanda Knox. aposBeautul, caringapos daughter stabbed  times Described by her father as beautul, intelligent and caring, Meredith - from Coulsdon, Surrey - was murdered on November , , during an exchange trip to Italy. Sickeningly, the -year-oldaposs body was found with  stab wounds on the bedroom floor of her apartment in Perugia. Her throat had been cut and an autopsy revealed evidence of sexual assault. John, who was a national newspaper journalist, later recalled how he first discovered his daughter was dead after ringing up a news desk to find out about reports of a British student killed in Perugia.I drop the phone. I do not believe it, he wrote in the Daily Mail.There has to be a mistake. I refuse to let the facts sink in. I repeat it over and over to myself: ‘Not beautul Meredith... Not beautul Meredith.apos  In a case that became a media storm, Meredithaposs housemate Amanda Knox was twice convicted and twice acquitted of her murder and spent four years in prison along with her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Another man, Rudy Guede, was also convicted of murder and was released in December last year after serving a -year sentence. Explaining the sensational acquittal, court adviser Gennaro Marasca said none of the evidence demonstrated that either Knox or Sollecito was present at the crime scene. He added that no biological traces ... could be attributed to them in the room of the murder or on the body of the victim, where in contrast numerous traces were found attributable to Guede.Familyaposs torment over aposstark possibilityapos of never seeing justiceIn the years since, Knox, , has furiously slammed the handling of the case and her utterly unjustied treatment. The Kerchers, meanwhile, have kept a lower profile as they struggle to get answers over what really happened the night Meredith was murdered.  Speaking on the tenth anniversary of her death, sister Stephanie said the pain and helplessness never ceases.She told MailOnline : It is dficult to come terms with not knowing exactly what happened that night, as whether you believe the guilt or innocence of the accused there are still contradictions and discrepancies in the judgeaposs summary.Nor have we heard anything more of a further investigation into who  they think may have been involved. Rudy Guede ... was convicted on the basis that he did not act alone, however, with no one  on trial or convicted it does of course raise questions for us as a family and anyone following the case. In his memoir, Meredith: Our Daughter’s Murder And The Heartbreaking Quest For The Truth, John revealed his pain that the courtroom drama had overshadowed the le of his little girl. In a moving portrait, he paid tribute to her jokes, her wicked one-liners and her laughter - revealing how following his orce from we Arline in , he was comforted by a voicemail from Meredith singing Whitney Houston’s I Will Always Love You down the phone. Yet the familyaposs torment was still painfully raw. We are still waiting for justice for our daughter and sister, he wrote. [We] have to face up to the stark possibility that we might never have a satisfactory picture of what unfolded in Perugia on that terrible November night. In the summer of , John suffered a stroke which he speculated could have been related to the stress of the criminal investigation and draining trips to Italy. Last January, he was found yards from his front door collapsed on the pavement. Scotland Yard initially said John died in a suspected hit-and-run, but later said he had died of a fall. An inquest into John’s death heard the freelance journalist was found by passers-by near his home in Croydon, south London, on a “dark, wet and windy” night in mid-January last year. He was “conscious but confused” and did not know why he was on the ground, the court heard. A Kercher family spokesman said at the time of John’s death: “We loved him dearly and he is going to be very sorely missed.” Knoxaposs aposcomplicatedapos relationship with Kerchers The Kerchersapos search for answers has at times brought them into conflict with Knox, with relatives slamming her inappropriate behaviour following her acquittal.The American has built up a huge media profile - releasing a memoir that reportedly earned her £.million, taking part in a Netflix documentary about the case and most recently hosting a series of podcasts including The Truth About True Crime. In , she ed to Italy to participate in a conference about wrongful convictions, sparking a rare statement from the Kerchers branding her actions inappropriate and very painful.The Kerchers’ lawyer, Francesco Maresca, told the: “All these insistences and appearances are only ever done to keep the attention on herself.“The murder is a tragic memory for the Kercher family, they lost their daughter and sister in such a terrible way. It’s also an injustice for them as they still don’t know the full truth.” He added of her involvement in the conference: “It’s unjustied because her process was not a classic case of ‘judicial error’. There was a swing in the decisions: some judges decided one way, and others in another way.” Previously Knox has said she would like to meet the Kercher family and visit Meredithaposs grave - but was warned by sister Stephanie to stay away.  She is currently pregnant with her first child with husband Christopher Robinson after suffering a miscarriage in May. Speaking to RTÉ Radio  in August, Knox admitted she has kept her distance from Meredithaposs parents, saying: “To this day, I can’t tell youthey know that I’m innocent or not.”  Given the fact that I don’t know that fact, I also understand that me even approaching them is a potential cause of great distress to their family and a dredging up of terrible memories.”She added: “I understand that the Kerchers have gone through an incredibly traumatic journey, not just from the tragic loss of Meredith but also through the incredibly confusing trial that they had to experience and go through and the feeling of being denied a sense of closure because of the outcome of the case. “Given that understanding, I also know that they have a complicated relationship with me.” Comment MORE ON Meredith KercherAmanda KnoxRudy GuedeRaffaele SollecitoMurder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The force released audio footage to remind people that their  service is for emergencies only.Police made the recording public as part of their Think Before You Dial campaign - but some said shaming an aposelderlyapos man wasnapost the way to deal with the situation.In the two-minute call, the man - whose voice has been disguised - said: This is an odd thing to put to you, but I bought a chicken yesterday from Tesco. What do you think to this story  Have your say in the comments  I put it straight in the fridge without opening the bag. I opened it and the smell from it is absolutely disgusting. Itaposs putrid. I donapost know what to do with it, can you advise me  Despite being repeatedly told the matter was between him and the supermarket, he continued to ask for help - tying up a  call handler for more than two minutes. There is nothing the police are going to be able to do with it, Iaposm afraid. This is a civil matter between you and Tesco, the operator said.  But the man didnapost hang up, he continued to ask for police assistance. If I paid for the petrol, could you not send a car out for me , he asked. The handler replied: No unfortunately, we are dealing with crimes at the moment. Itaposs not under our remit for us to come and collect a rotting chicken. The call ended soon after. But Thames Valley Police followers on social media have hit back at the force, claiming the caller could have dementia. This is CLEARLY anelderly person that needs help. Perhaps even has dementia, Klara Badrick Twelftree wrote.The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening. Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  She went on: This call shouldnapost have been shared. Perhaps some time should have been spent stopping the talk of a chickenand seeingheaposs actually ok rather than sharing for all to hear. Another person agreed, adding: Thataposs sad as that elderly lady could have dementia. My mother has dementia and often phones me in distress so Iaposm wonderingrather than share this maybe the police should consider getting themselves some phone numbers or transfer calls possibly to someone more suitable eg mental health.

She says this meant that she couldnapost even breastfeed her daughter, Willow, now two, as they would have covered her face and suffocated her. The mum has also had issues with other women and men, who sexualise her because of her breast. The -year-old is now a JJ in cup size and desperate for breast reduction surgery because she hates her boobs so much. Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror Elizabeth said: My boobs havenapost stopped growing since I was a  year old child and obviously my boobs grew even bigger during my pregnancy.I really wanted to breastfeed my daughter because I thought it would be an amazing way to bond, but my boobs were just too big.My breasts are so big that they entirely covered Willowaposs whole face and she would have just suffocated underneath them.It was really upsetting because it was something Iaposd really wanted to try but I just couldnapost.Even now the size of my boobs affects the stuff I can do with Willow.I have to carry her above my boobs as I canapost carry her on my hips because my boobs are in the way.I canapost even hug her properly, she has to be above my boobs in order to hug me back.And because of the constant and severe back pain caused by the size of my boobs, I canapost really run around after her and play with her.When Elizabeth reached her twenties and realised her boobs were still growing she began to hate them.She struggled to find bras that would fit her and doubled up on sports brasshe was going to exercise.As she has continued to get older, Elizabeth says she still gets growing pains in her boobs now and that she thinks theyaposre still growing.As a young teenager it was quite cool, but Iaposm  now and theyaposre still growing, she said. I get a lot of hate from women, I have lost female friends. And I get abusive stuff from males because they see them and they think that is all I am.She added: I am sure my boobs are still growing because I am still going up in cup sizes. I am now bursting out of bras that fit me a couple of months ago.As I have gotten older my boobs have gotten heavier, they hurt more and they are blotchy purple where the strain of the weight has stretched the skin so thin. I hate them. I have a bad back all of the time and the physically hurt to touch which obviously affects my time with my husband, Richard, . It feels like shooting electricity.I have to be very careful when I am cooking over the stove so that I donapost burn them which I have done a few times previously. They just get in the way of everything.I also only buy baggy clothes now to hide away becauseI wore anything where you can slightly see my boobs I get disgusting attention from men and people just stare at them.I have even been called a aposslagapos before while wearing a turtle neck. I canapost win.Elizabeth canapost buy bras from high street brands, she has to specically search online for underwear that will fit her ever-growing boobs.The bras that she has to buy cost her between £ to £.Elizabeth has been turned away multiple times by NHS doctors for a breast reduction as they have just told her to lose weight.However, she says that no matter her weight her boobs are always big.Elizabeth, a stay-at-home-mum, added: No matter my weight I have always had large boobs, even when I was  stone I still had large boobs.My weight fluctuates, as most womenaposs does, but my boobs have just kept growing. I went from  stone G to  stone with H - they just kept growing despite my weight loss.So I have taken matters into my own hands and I am trying to raise the money for the surgery myself.It would completely change my le.People seem to think itaposs a good thing to have big boobs but it is not at all.I even struggle to sleep. I canapost lie on my back as theyaposre too heavy, I canapost lie on my front as itaposs too painful.I have to lie on my sides and even then I have to physically position my breasts with my hands.Iaposd love to just do simple things like chase my daughter around and wear halter neck tops.Comment MORE ON NHSPregnancyBack painCosmetic surgeryPlastic surgeryTeenagersFitnessBoobsBreastfeeding\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Unfortunately, the whole of the NHS remains under severe pressure hospital handover delays, unfortunately, mean patients waiting longer for an ambulance response. Our staff and volunteers are working tirelessly to reach patients as quickly as possible, but we accept that on too many occasions, this is not as quickly as we would want and certainly not as quickly as patients and their loved ones would want. On September ,  per cent of handovers at the Royal Stoke University Hospital were delayed, with the average handover being  minutes  seconds, against a national target of  minutes.

PCR swabs from a number of testing sites have been ing negative results to people who had the virus due to errors at a major laboratory in the Midlands. The public have now been told to get retested while close contacts with symptoms are also advised to get a PCR check. It is the latest controversy around the bungled NHS Test and Trace programme which has seen the Government hand multimillion contracts to private firms to run much of the system. Immensa Health was handed a £ million contract and runs a laboratory in Wolverhampton which health officials said gave , people incorrect results between September  and October . Have you been impacted by unreliable testing at the lab  Email webnews@mirror  Most of these results were for people in South West England, prompting fears of spike in the region. Dr Will Welfare, incident director at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “We have recently seen a rising number of positive lateral flow test results subsequently testing negative on PCR. “As a result of our investigation, we are working with NHS Test and Trace and the company to determine the laboratory technical issues which have led to inaccurate PCR results being issued to people. We have immediately suspended testing at this laboratory while we continue the investigation.” Dr Kit Yates, expert at the University of Bath, said: “There’s been a concerted effort to highlight what’s been going on with these strange results for a while now in the hope that someone would investigate. “We now know , people are believed to have been given  negatives, but this doesn’t even come near to the cost of the mistake.  “Many of these people will have been forced into school or work potentially infecting others. This could be part of the reason behind some of the recent rises we’ve seen.” The testing site had previously made headlines after staff were filmed fighting, sleeping, fighting and rolling around on the floor. The contract was handed to Immensa without a standard tender process and according to Companies House the firm only appears to have existed since May just after the start of the pandemic. Andrea Riposati, CEO of Immensa Health Clinic Ltd, said: “We are fully collaborating with UKHSA on this matter. “Quality is paramount for us. We have proudly analysed more than . million samples for NHS Test and Trace.  “We do not wish this matter or anything  to tarnish the amazing work done by the UK in this pandemic.” West Berkshire Council released a statement calling on those who used its Newbury Showground testing site to book another PCR check. The mass testing site in Chieveley, West Berkshire, is one of those affected by the errors at the Immensa lab.  It said Newbury Showground “had results sent out that may have incorrectly shown as negative for Covid-”. It continued: “After receiving reports from local residents in recent weeks that there were concerns about the accuracy of test results from the site, we passed these concerns onto the DHSC for further investigation. “The DHSC has now confirmed that a number of sites nationally may have been affected by this issue, including the one at Newbury Showground.” Those who received a negative result for a PCR test between October  and , as well as their close contacts, were “strongly” encouraged by the local authority to take another test. Dr Welfare, of the UK Has, added: “There is no evidence of any faults with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits themselves and the public should remain confident in using them and in other laboratory services currently provided. “If you get a positive LFD test, it’s important to make sure that you then get a follow up PCR test to confirm you have COVID-. “If you have symptoms of COVID-, self-isolate and take a PCR test.

The pub has not responded to Berkshire Liveaposs request to comment on the situation. Councillor Helen Manghnani, who represents Tilehurst, says she sometimes visits the pub but had not been aware of the sign. She said: Like everything in todayaposs world, things seem to be louder, music, traffic and even people intend to talk in higher pitched voices. It is dficult for those in senior years to deal with ultra-loud noises and to be quite frank, many of the complaints I receive revolve around loud music and late night garden parties. She added: With regards to the sign, it could have been a little more understanding, leaving off the sentence referring to living next door to a pub. We don’t know how long people have lived there, whether the pub came first or the house.

Prince William blasted billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk over their race to leave the planetto travel around space.He urged them to focus on saving Earth and hailed them for having “great minds”. However, he failed to criticise the wealthy duo for how their companies and lestyle play a signicant part in the climate crisis.Meanwhile, the Queen was “overheard” slamming world leaders who “talk but don’t do” when it comes to climate action, ahead of COP.The monarch’s private comment was coincidentally recorded by a journalist and quickly made headlines around the world.  And it’s understandable why. The Queen - renowned for staying silent and dressing in impartiality - suddenly having a rather strong opinion on such a political issue is quite the story.And while there’s a blatant sense of hypocrisy about a family preaching about the climate while sitting on mined jewels, flying private jets and running multiple estates the Royal Family’s sudden interest in Mother Nature also feels like a transparent attempt to ert people’s attention.  From what  Or who  Well, Prince Andrew, of course. This week was the Duke of Yorkaposs pre-trial hearing as part of the -year-oldaposs sexual abuse allegations. In , Virginia Giuffre claimed the Duke of York abused her on a number of occasions when she was just . Vigorously denying the allegations in his infamous  Newsnight interview, Andrew said he had no recollection of ever meeting her and claimed the photo of the two together had been doctored.But the noise surrounding Andrew’s legal battle has quickly been muffled by coverage of William’s Earthshot initiative and the Queen’s rare anger towards Russia and China’s green efforts.The Met also quietly announced it was dropping its probe into Andrew, while the Duke is still laying low, playing on Mummy’s horses.So while the Queen and William are sweating about the planet, Andrew is staying cool.

The powder, which reportedly came from a nearby manufacturing plant, baffled locals in Preston Brook, near Runcorn, on October .The road is near the Saint Gobain Isover manufacturing plant, which produces mineral wool insulation, CheshireLive reports. Residents are worried about their pets and wildle ingesting the powder as some fear it contains glass. Dave Espley, , woke up to find his car and the street he lives on covered in the substance and said it looked like it has snowed.  He also said a number of cars have been damaged and residents with vegetable gardens have been told to throw their home-grown produce away. He said: The issue is what it has discharged and whether itaposs safe for wildle and pets, itaposs also very abrasive so itaposs causing all sorts of issues with peopleaposs cars as well. It looked like it snowed when we got up in the morning, literally everything was covered in it and the main concern was wondering what it is.  He added: Weaposve been told it is  per cent glass so apparently it will not dissolve as soon as it rains. Iaposm not quite sure how they are going to fully recty it because itaposs all over the fields as well. I know people have vegetable patches and they have been advised to chuck it all away. You can still see it all over the road outside the plantitself, it looks like frost. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email .The Environment Agency has been round and so has the Isover plant manager and apologised and I think he was having a worse day than anyone . The main concern here is what is in it andit is potentially toxic. Weaposve been told itaposs not harmful and not to eat it, but obviously we are concerned about pets and wildle. Dave also said that due to the abrasive substance, it has damaged a number of cars on the street and valets have been arranged to help remove the powder from peopleaposs cars. He added: Theyaposre trying toand theyaposve booked appointments with car cleaners to come round and clean all the cars, I had to use the hose to get it off of my car. It was absolutely covered, thankfully we didnapost rub it, but I know other people who have taken their car to a car wash and this stuff has caused real damage. I am assuming this is what they use to clean out the chimney as it is real abrasive stuff. A neighbour of mine has said their windscreen is covered in scratches because he took it to a car wash. They have been around valeting peopleaposs cars and doing a big clean up as they can. Itaposs been reported to the environmental agency and there is a big clear-up happening at the minute. A spokesperson for Isover said that the dust is nothing to worry about and apologised to residents over the situation. The statement read: There was a small release of dust from the vent ducting when we restarted the plant after a short planned shutdown. Our Plant Manager has been visiting local residents over the last few days to explain the situation, apologise and to reassure residents that there is nothing to worry about at all. Where needed we have also arranged for professional cleaning to take place and we have been in dialogue with the Environment Agency who are fully aware of the release. We take great care to be a responsible business and take issues like this very seriously indeed.” A spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: We are working with the company to offer advice and guidance under our regulatory role.

Lyra Cassell, , from Allerton, Liverpool, found a lump in her groin at the end of August and asked to see a doctor. Her mum, Hayley, says they were told the lump was a hernia, and that they could not get a hospital appointment for months due to an NHS backlog that has been caused by the pandemic.Hayley told the Liverpool Echo : She had a hernia as a baby so we thought it was nothing to worry about. Then we went for a walk in Garston Park and she went aposIaposve got this lump on my neck.apos It was on the side of her neck and it was quite big. I thought aposthataposs not right Lyraapos and I phoned the doctors again. Following her second appointment with a nurse, Lyra was referred for an appointment the hospital and a few days later she had her bloods taken by her GP. Hayley said: [The doctor] phoned me on the Tuesday morning to tell me she was anaemic and to stop giving her sweets and fizzy drinks. They said sheaposs not diabetic but her blood sugar levels are slightly high. However, two weeks later, Lyra went for an ultrasound appointment followed by a biopsy and further blood tests, and on September  received the devastating news that she had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. She started receiving chemotherapy the next day. Mum Hayley said: Everything was going well for her. The fit and healthy Belvedere Academy student had recently smashed her GCSEs and was running five times a week for the Liverpool Harriers And Athletic Club. Hayley, , said: [Lyra] works in Ginoaposs restaurant in town part-time on the reception and she also taught dance in Liverpool College to four- year olds, so she was really busy and she was loving it. She was saying she was tired but we just put it down to working and going out with her friends. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is a type of cancer that affects white blood cells. It progresses quickly and aggressively and requires immediate treatment.  Hayley said: Lyraaposs first question was aposwill I lose my hair apos They explained to us that it will be a very dficult process of at least two years. It feels like itaposs someone  this has happened to - this doesnapost happen to us. Itaposs just horrendous. Two weeks ago I had a normal, and what we thought was a healthy teenager, ready to smash her A-levels and go out clubbing and do all the things we did as a   year old, and now everything is a train wreck. Lyra is currently undergoing treatment and has recently been diagnosed with steroid-induced diabetes. If Lyra hadnapost found the lump on her neck when she did, Hayley fears how long it would have been before she found out she had cancer. With this in mind, Hayley is keen to raise awareness and encourage others to get checked out at the first sign of symptoms.In a bid to help the family during this time, Lyraaposs running coach and family friend Jayne Teare has set up a Go Fund Me page.In a message on the page Jayne said: Lyra’s unique love of le and people shines through with most people she meets. She is warm, funny, goofy, caring, determined and very kind. She and her family are terried by what this new future holds and the upset it will have on Lyra and her loved ones. The journey will be long and dficult but we have to focus on the light at the end of the tunnel. Currently, le for Lyra is tough as she undergoes extensive chemotherapy and deals with the complications that this can cause. Any support or help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

The -year-old, who had been an MP for  years, was holding his regular Friday surgery for constituents at the Belfairs Methodist Church, Leigh-on-Sea. Police have arrested a -year-old man on suspicion of murder and a kne was recovered at the scene. His death comes five years after Labour MP Jo Cox was murdered as she arrived to host a surgery in her Batley and Spen constituency in June . As tributes poured in, Downing Street lowered the Union flag to half-mast as a mark of respect to the popular Southend West MP. While Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs we Carrie said he was a true gent.Taking to Twitter to express her shock and send her thoughts to Sir Davidaposs we Julia, she said: Absolutely devastating news about Sir David Amess. He was hugely kind and good. An enormous animal lover and a true gent. This is so completely unjust. Thoughts are with his we and their children.Labour leader Keir Starmer said: Horric and deeply shocking news. Thinking of David, his family and his staff.Deemed on of the longest-serving MPs, below is an outline of who Sir David was and where he came from. Who was Sir David Amess  Sir David was born in Plaistow, Essex, now known as Newham in London on March , . As a child he attended St Anthonyaposs Junior and Infant School, then St Bonaventureaposs Catholic School in Forest Gate before moving on to the College of Technology. His higher education took place at the Faculty of Science and Technology of Bournemouth University, where he got a bachelors in economics and government. He taught at a primary school in Bethnal Green and had some experience as underwriter and recruitment consultant but he quickly turned to to public service in politics.  Family le The MP and his we Julia, who worked for him as a part-time caseload worker have four daughters and a son. His daughter, Katie, is an actress based in LA and recently starred in Captain America. Political le The Conservative MP served as an MP for  years, initially in Basildon from  before he took on the role of representing Southend West from . He regarded his main interests and areas of expertise as animal welfare and pro-le issues. But his campaigning efforts in the House of Commons in recent years were most closely associated with his campaign to see Southend awarded city status. A long-term eurosceptic, he was part of the Leave Means Leave pro-Brexit campaign during the EU referendum. He never held a ministerial role and was vocal about a whole range of issues, from animal rights to campaigning against abortion.During his time in parliament he sponsored a string of bills including the AbortionBill , the Protection Against Cruel Tethering Actand the Warm Homes Bill, which passed into law in December  as the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act, according to his website. The two main issues he had at heart were animal rights and pro-le issues. Sir David has not been shy in ensuring questions he asks Government ministers also include his long-running campaign to make Southend a city. In December , he secured an adjournment debate in the Commons specically on the campaign and he told MPs: I am not messing around. We have got it from the Prime Minister that Southend is going to become a city - and it will become a city.  As a strident supporter of the British monarchy, Sir David saw another opportunity in November  as the Commons considered plans for the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee next year. He asked for a new statue of the Queen and for a city status competition to ensure Southend is finally elevated. In March , Sir David repeated his statue calls - insisting the Queen deserved one for being a great monarch.  His campaign for a memorial to Dame Vera Lynn on the White Clfs of Dover also won support from a minister in May this year. He was well known in Southend West for his support for local causes and every year held the aposannual centenariansapos tea partyapos to celebrate constituents who had turned . Away from his campaigning, Sir David announced in December  that he would run to be one of the three deputy speakers in the House of Commons.He ultimately missed out and continued with his support for Brexit and working in his constituency.He recently wrote of how MPs had received security advice about holding surgeries, and how attacks had spoilt the great British tradition of the voters meeting politicians. In Ayes  Ears: A Survivoraposs Guide to Westminster - which was published in November - he wrote about Jo Coxaposs murder and how she had been attacked in the most barbaric fashion imaginable. Sir David also wrote about the machete attack on Nigel Jones MP, which resulted in his aide Andy Penningtonaposs death as he tried to protect him. And the Essex politician mentioned he had experienced nuisance from the odd member of the general public at his own property. He said most MPs had changed the way they interacted with voters, and the Commons authorities took the threats members faced very seriously.  Achievements Sir Amess was knighted in the  New Year Honours for political and public service. He was also given the Animal Welfare and Environment Champion award at the Dods Charity Champion Awards in  for his commitment to animal warfare. Ahead of his death being announced, Councillor John Lamb, who was the scene of the horric attack, heaped praise on the MP, who he called a family man. Heaposs always trying to help people and especially refugees heaposs tried to help. Heaposs a very amicable person and he does stick by his guns, he says what he believes and he sticks by it. Tributes to apostrue gentapos and a aposgreat manapos Tributes from across the political spectrum have flooded in for Sir David. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said all our hearts are filled with shock and sadness. Mr Johnsonaposs we, Carrie, said she was devastated. Absolutely devastating news about Sir David Amess. He was hugely kind and good, she said on Twitter. An enormous animal lover and a true gent. This is so completely unjust. Former Conservative prime minister Theresa May tweeted: Heartbreaking to hear of the death of Sir David Amess. A decent man and respected Parliamentarian, killed in his own community while carrying out his public duties. A tragic day for our democracy. My thoughts and prayers are with Davidaposs family. Former prime minister Tony Blair said he was shocked and horried by the murder of Sir David Amess. David and I came into Parliament together in , he said in a statement. Though on opposite political sides I always found him a courteous, decent and thoroughly likeable colleague who was respected across the House. This is a terrible and sad day for our democracy. Meanwhile, Jo Coxaposs widower Brendan said: My thoughts and love are with Davidaposs family. They are all that matter now. This brings everything back. The pain, the loss, but also how much love the public gave us following the loss of Jo. I hope we can do the same for David now.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Conservative PartyEssex PoliceDavid AmessEU ReferendumHospitalsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dad Thomas Hughes, , and step-mum Emma Tustin, , are accused of mistreating Arthur Labinjo-Hughes before he suffered an un-survivable brain injury at his home in Cranmore Road, Solihull, West Midlands, on June  .The young boy died in hospital in the early hours of the following day, Birmingham Mail reported. Hughes and Tustin both deny murder. Yesterday in court on the sixth day of the trial jurors were played CCTV footage taken in the living room of the family home on June , when Arthur allegedly endured the fatal injury.  They were also shown texts between the Hughes and Tustin from that day, including a photo sent from the woman in which Arthur appears to be crying. From the home Tustin texted Hughes, who was out at the shops, multiple times, writing that the boy was grabbing walls and door and throwing himself down just before pm. They discussed whether a mark on his face was bruising before Tustin sent Hughes an audio clip of Arthur crying followed by a text saying: Still at it. The prosecution showed a clip of the woman leaving the living room for about a minute, during which time they contend she dealt Arthur the fatal blow. Jonas Hankin QC told the court that around this time Tustin texted the aposballoon ladyapos about her birthday decorations for an upcoming party. At .pm Tustin messaged Hughes: Just copped me in the stomach he has thrown himself all over the floor wonapost get up for s*** Iaposve shut the door on him.  A minute later she took a picture on her phone showing Arthur lying down in the hallway. The court was played living room footage showing Tustin walking into the kitchen before ing while looking at her phone and then walking into the hallway. She s carrying Arthur into the living room, Mr Hankin told the court. His body is limp. She carries Arthur into the kitchen then into the living room and places him on the floor. Arthur appears to be unconscious. His eyes are closed, body is limp. He falls to the left onto the floor. It appears his body is limp. Tustin gets up and goes into the kitchen. The next footage from .pm shows Tustin partially pick Arthur up from the floor and drag him into the hallway. She then reappears and places Arthur on the sofa before walking into the kitchen. Giving evidence in court earlier on Thursday, Tustinaposs hairdresser, Catherine Milhench, said she wished she had called police after seeing Arthur on June  and . Ms Milhench, who works from home and first cut Tustinaposs hair in the summer of , said she met Arthur later that year and he seemed absolutely fine, healthy, a normal boy.  Describing a hair appointment at her home in February , Ms Milhench said of Arthur: He was still, I would say, healthy-looking but not happy. He was made to sit downwith his hands on his knees and not move. Ms Milhench told the court: I just thought heaposs obviously been naughty at home. When you go to other peopleaposs you donapost want your child to misbehave. Answering questions from Mr Hankin, Ms Milhench said at another six-hour hair appointment on June  , Arthur was told by Tustin to stand by and face the front door. Mr Hankin asked Ms Milhench: Throughout the time that she was there in your home, how did she sheinteract with Arthur  The witness answered: Telling him to stand, not to lean on the door, to face the door... not to move. Tustin then went to the bathroom to have her hair washed, Ms Milhench said, adding of Arthur: He was made to come upstairs and face another door upstairs. She said he couldnapost be trusted. Asked for her view of Arthuraposs state during the visit, Ms Milhench said: Deteriorated. You could see his collar bones. He was wearing a pyjama onesie and you could just see his collar bones sticking out.  I didnapost remember that from last time. He had lost weight. Using the phrase like skeletal to describe what Arthuraposs condition made her think of, Ms Milhench said the boy appeared to be drained and weak, adding: It wasnapost nice to see. His legs trying to walk up the stairs would be shaking, like he couldnapost hold himself up. Asked what happened when Hughes arrived at her home to pick up Tustin, Ms Milhench added: He parked on my drive. Tom had himby the scruff, took him out. I remember Arthur falling on the floor. He just collapsed and fell into the car. The court heard Tustin ed to complete her hair appointment on June , arriving at around .am. During the visit, Ms Milhench said Tustin and Hughes were constantly swearing at Arthur like a game of tennis, with Tustin going on to claim that Arthur was being pressure-pointed. Ms Milhench said she had suggested Arthur should be sent to live with his grandmother, but was told that would be what he wants and would allow him to win. The court was also told that Ms Milhenchaposs partner, Tobias Jarman, snuck a drink of water to Arthur without Tustin and Hughes knowing. Mr Jarman, who said Arthur looked malnourished and had cracked lips, told the court: I tried to reassure him. I said, aposyou have not got to be scared of me in any wayapos. He look petried. It was not the normal glow you see in a kidaposs eyes of that age. It looked like there was fear ingrained inside of there. Hughes and Tustin deny murder. Tustin has admitted one count of child cruelty but has denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denies child cruelty offences.

Madison Collins began suffering from head jerks and ticks, which mum Melanie says seemed to come from nowhere in January of this year.Melanie, , described how one frightening attack in June left -year-old Madison, known as Madi, unable to breathe and needing hospital treatment. The worried mum said she now fears the ticks are being caught via social media after learning  other girls developed similar symptoms.The manager said Madi is now aposticking every dayapos to the point where sheaposs repeated phrases  times, punched herself and her hands have even locked into place for three hours. Melanie remains sceptical that her daughteraposs sudden condition is caused by social media specically as she questions why boys have been less affected, however she said she aposwouldnapost rule it outapos. She is now speaking out about Madiaposs situation and urging parents with similar experiences to come forward to find its cause. Melanie, of Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, said: [The college] said that they had  girls and one boy that have ticks at the moment. I was relieved. I know thataposs an awful thing to say but hearing that made me know that something has actually happened.  Something is happening to make this happen to girls andI can find a reason for it, I can deal with it better. If somethingaposs happening as a nation, we need to get to the bottom of it. We owe it to our daughters to find out why this is happening and what we can do to make sure it doesnapost happen to other girls her age. I just felt like I wanted to do something and rather than sitting there speculating, I want to find out for myself how big of a problem this is rather than being told aposthis is happeningapos. I want to get people together so we can do something about it. I think thereaposs strength in numbers and rather than this getting pushed under the carpet,I can find other people going through this, we can push this to the government level to get something done about it and get proper research to find what the cause is. Research led by Dr Kirsten Muller-Vahl at the Hannover University Medical School stated that a spike in patients displaying aposticksapos positively correlated to a rise in videos featuring Touretteaposs on sites such as TikTok, YouTube and Instagram.The study claimed the rise in ticks could be viewed as a aposstress reactionapos to societyaposs emphasis on iniduality and aposvaluing their alleged exceptionalityapos, which they say promotes aposattention-seeking behavioursapos. Worried Melanie has read the articles on the subject and also heard the condition linked to stress from the pandemic but she remains unsure what is causing it. However she refuses to rule anything out and called for more people to come forward so that more research can be done.  Melanie said: Online articles are saying that social media sites like TikTok is a probable cause. One of them is that people are going on there to highlight their ticks and thataposs starting off other kids to have it. On my LinkedIn posts there have been comments that have been said about that social media is being looked into as a possible cause, people have said aposmaybe social media is the reason whyapos, thereaposs been a couple of articles as well that have been linked on my LinkedIn post. My gut is telling me that itaposs external. Something has happened which is affecting girls. A lot of people are putting it down to [social media] or the stress of the pandemic but Iaposm not convinced of that because Madi will delete her social media every so often. Andshe feels like sheaposs becoming a bit consumed by social media she will delete it from time to time and will almost hit a reset and then go back to it. When I asked her about her stress levels during the pandemic she wasnapost particularly overly stressed. Iaposm not saying that it hasnapost played a part in it, Iaposm just not convinced she was stressed enough to bring on ticks. But then I donapost know, Iaposm not a medical doctor. I donapost think itaposs social media because I thinkit was social media,it was TikTok, like people are saying, I think boys would be affected. I wouldnapost rule it out. But I just thinkit was social media, it would affect boys as well, particularly as this condition is more prevalent in boys than it is in girls.  Melanie, who described her daughter as aposreliableapos, aposactiveapos and aposfunnyapos said she never had any of these symptoms as a child and from her understanding most children with Touretteaposs usually get recognised by the child is six-years-old. The devoted mum said sheaposs also been told by professionals that normally cases of Touretteaposs are more prevalent in boys. However, in the last  months thereaposs been a massive spike in referrals for girls between the ages of -. Melanie said: It was probably about eight months ago that she started these head ticks where she was jolting her head and they started getting progressively worse. Then she started having almost seizure-type ticks where her eyes would roll in the back of her head. We had to phone the ambulance, sheaposs been to hospital about it twice. They were so bad that she couldnapost breathe properly. It was almost like a seizure but when she was in hospital they confirmed it wasnapost because her vitals were quite normal, so it was just a tick spasm attack. It was frightening to watch. Sheaposs had a few of those. And then the vocal ticks about this time started kicking in as well. Madi says the ticks have had a dramatic effect on her daily le.  Her ticks include clicking noises, neck jerks, punching herself, vocal ticks in which she repeats a phrase repeatedly, sometimes for a whole day, scratching herself and even banging her head against the table. Madi said: When the ticks were small it didnapost really matter and to be honest I put it down to anxiety ticks for quite a long time and I just thought theyaposd go away. And when they got really bad it stopped everything. I used to read a lot and for a few weeks after my ticks got really bad I just couldnapost pick up a book, Iaposd just throw it. And there are still times I do throw my books. Just not as often now, you kind of learn how to deal with it. I wasnapost able to sit through my classes. I was told to leave a lot. I practically wasnapost able to do anything normal anymore. Everything became a lot harder. When I was working at the restaurant, I would have incidents where I would throw a glass on the floor. Then when I was trying to pick it up, I would just put it in my mouth and try to bite down unless someone took it out. There will be days where I can barely walk a few steps without falling over. When Iaposm trying to have a conversation with someone, my vocal ticks can get in the way and they can cause a lot of mishaps. For example, people think Iaposm calling them a b*tch or something. When Iaposm trying to do assessments or exams it can be really hard. I was trying to do an assessment in criminology and my hands locked so I was trying to do it with one hand and it didnapost unlock for three hours after, which is quite painful because itaposs quite a cramping one. Mum-of-three Melanie shared a post on LinkedIn and said that around - parents have contacted her, with around four or five of them saying their children have suddenly developed Touretteaposs.  She said that Madiaposs college have been aposabsolutely brilliantapos and theyaposve kept her included in all the decisions made surrounding her education. Melanie said: She hasnapost been diagnosed with Touretteaposs yet because she had to have symptoms for over a year to get diagnosed. Itaposs walking that fine line of not accepting it but at the same time accepting it because you donapost want her to feel uncomfortable by it. At the moment it looks like Touretteaposs, thataposs what itaposs presenting itself as. It was a lot to get my head around and to be honest itaposs only then when talking to the college that I was realising that other girls are going through this that I thought there must be a cause, andwe can find the reason weaposve got a better chance of finding treatment or a cure. Dr Muller-Vahl et alaposs study claimed teenagers were presenting ticks similar to a popular German YouTuber who demonstrated them in his videos, which have gone viral over the last two years. Suzanne Dobson of Touretteaposs Action, a UK-based charity that researches the condition and supports affected families, suggested in an interview earlier this year that social media may simply be encouraging teenage girls to be more open about their ticks. But she also speculated that gathering more aposlikesapos for demonstrating severe ticks, could be resulting in the girls no longer trying to stop the ticks. Hospitals in the UK claim to have seen an increase in ticks being reported in teenage girls since the pandemic. Great Ormond Street and Evelina Childrenaposs Hospitals each received between four and six referrals of ticks in teenage girls between -. However during the last three months of , this surged to each receiving three to four referrals per week.

There could also be some dense fog patches first thing Saturday, slowly lting through the morning. It will be milder towards the west, C or C towards the southwest, and colder to the north east, C or C. The first snowfall of the season could hit as early as next week. Some forecasts suggest snow could fall over high ground late next week, possibly the October - weekend. Friday night Many parts cold and clear with grass frost for central, northern and eastern UK. Windy with showers far northeast Scotland. Patchy low cloud and drizzle far southwest ing northeast later. Saturday Fog patches in south-west clearing by midday.

Rachel Kennedy, , and Liam McCrohan, , had placed a bet for the numbers , , , , ,  and  for five weeks in a row. They did it the same way — an automatic ticket, with the direct debit coming out each week for their £. go. But back in late February this year, Rachel had brought one too many cups of coffee and her funds dipped below where it needed to be.Have you ever aposalmostapos won the lottery  Email us at webnews@mirror  Her account didnapost quite have enough to process the transaction, so payment for their ticket payment didn’t go through. Not the end of the world , as usual, your number havenapost come up. Itaposs quite the issue, however,they all have - and your lives should be changing forever. The seven digits came up, and Rachel was notied on the app that she had a Winning Match. She then excitedly called her boyfriend and her mum before contacting the hotline. Liam and Rachelaposs joy quickly faded as Camelot told the couple they indeed had a match - but Rachel hadnapost had the funds in her account to buy the ticket, so it wasnapost ever actually purchased. Liam said the app really made it look like they had won as it comes up with winning match in orange. After Liam got over the shock of losing, he posted a screenshot of the win to Facebook - incredibly laughing about their loss.He said he’d posted it so his friends can see but it quickly blew up - and the post amassed over , likes and the unlucky lovebirds became worldwide news. Liam said: Initially I just posted it so my friends could see. I’ve only got like  followers but then it just blew up and I think itaposs got over , likes now. The jackpot was since claimed by one winner in Switzerland.  Rachel, a business student at Brighton University, said: I called my boyfriend Liam and my mum into the room and they couldnapost believe it either so I was like, aposoh my god I need to call themapos. I called the number thinking that I had won £million and they said aposyeah youaposve got the right numbers but you didnapost have the funds in your account for the payment of the ticket so it didnapost actually go throughapos.

But she now believes the numbers she had been playing for weeks are unlucky and she has changed them for good. She said: I actually have two sets of numbers that I use. One of them is birthdays of family members and stuff, but the ones that were the winner were just random numbers that I had clicked one day and had been using ever since.

Jaclyn Misch, from Michigan, USA, was -years-old when she started to think she had a health issue as she hadnapost had her period yet. After several doctors appointments she was diagnosed with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-HauserType , a rare condition that occurs in females and mainly affects the reproductive system. Essentially it means that she was born with no womb or cervix, and also has an incomplete vagina. A dilator was used to stretch her vaginal canal so that she could have penetrative sex, but she cannot carry her own child. In , the now -year-old who won the title of Miss Michigan USA , met Jonathan and then married him in .  The couple tried for a baby through IVF and gestational surrogacy, but after three failed embryo transfers they parted ways from their former carrier. They currently have a new gestational carrier that volunteered to potentially carry their baby. I was diagnosed with MRKH when I was sixteen my family physician was concerned I had never started my cycle but since I was lean and athletic, thought this might be the delay, Jaclyn said.  At sixteen years old, I really wanted to pretend that none of this was happening, so thataposs exactly what I did. Iaposd been trying so hard to fit in with my high school friends, but as fate would have it, my diagnosis had a dferent path planned for me. I was now one in , women around the world diagnosed with MRKH Syndrome. The fundamental biological traits that made me a woman, my self-identity and the plans for my future had shted.  I had to use dilators to have sex, I would never have a period and be like my girlfriends and I would never carry a child. I didnapost feel the same as other females and I frankly still donapost. Jaclyn said she kept quiet about the condition for years, not even telling members of her own family. Husband Jonathan helped the wine educator and marketer open up. He encouraged me to enter my first pageant and I won, she continued. I truly feel like I won as a way to use the  to spread awareness about MRKH syndrome. At the time of my diagnosis, there was no social media and the only thing my parents and I could find online about it were a few research articles. I felt confused, scared and angry. I ignored most of my emotion towards it and didnapost want to think about it.  It took me years to come to terms with the diagnoses and fully process. I had to learn to become comfortable in my own skin again for sixteen years of my le I had been conditioned by society and our culture to think I would grow up, get married and have a baby. Jaclyn had long hoped that she would one day become a mum.  I played with baby dolls and dreamt of having a baby bump, she continued. So when the diagnosis came, my self-identity shted and I had to start envisioning a le without the blessing of pregnancy. As far as sexual intercourse goes, I think itaposs important to preface this by saying everything is aposnormalapos down there on the outside. But girls with MRKH have a aposshallowapos vaginal canal, meaning in order to have sexual intercourse you need to self-dilate . Or have surgery to elongate the vaginal canal my doctor and I decided dilation was my best option, as itaposs also the first line of treatment recommended by The American College of Gynaecology.  I didnapost have much of an issue and things went quickly and smoothly. As happy as the couple are together, MRKH has had an affect on their relationship. Iaposve been with my husband Jonathan since  and I have to say that my diagnosis affects our relationship emotionally in our journey to parenthood, Jaclyn said. Seeing our friends get pregnant so fast and easily will always strike a small chord in my mind. Of course, Iaposm happy for them but always wishing to have that ability myself. After our three failed embryo transfers and parting ways with our previous gestational carrier I was a mess. Asking myself what my le purpose is, will we ever have a child of our own  I was completely deflated, and it hit me much harder than Jonathan. Instead of the path to parenthood being joyful and happy ours is stressful, emotional, and draining both mentally and financially. Our journey to parenthood is by far the most challenging. For the longest time, Iaposve seen PGS aposchromosomally normalapos embryos taking on the first time. Iaposve had friends with MRKHget pregnant on their first transfer with their high-quality embryos so naturally, I thought we would too as our embryos were perfectly normal. But that wasnapost the case three times in a row. The waiting period is also extremely dficult. Between transfers, waiting for the two-week pregnancy blood test building up excitement only to be completely deflated with the negative results. Currently, we have a new gestational carrier and are beyond grateful that she and her husband have volunteered to help us start a family. We are in the process of having her screened by our IVF doctor. Jaclyn hopes that others will gain strength from her story. She said: You are never alone so many women have been diagnosed with MRKH from around the world there is an entire network of MRKH sisters waiting for you with encouragement, understanding and support through every phase of MRKH.

The peculiar scene was discovered on Monday between Great Langdale and Little Langdale, a spot considered one of the most spectacular in the area. The table was set with plates, champagne flutes and water glasses, as well as what appeared to be a two-level stand for cakes and a cheese platter. One plate had been polished off, while the other held remnants of a piece of cake, strawberries and cheese. From a small jar of jam and a bowl of what resembles whipped cream on the cake stand, it appeared likely that scones had featured as part of the meal.Photographer Ashley Cooper told the BBC he had first thought the table and chairs, which were set up a little less than m from the path, were part of an art installation.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter However, on closer inspection, it appeared the half-eaten food and glasses of fizz had been abandoned by a celebrating couple, he said.Mr Cooper thought it likely that the table had been left by someone from the Instagram generation.The Ambleside local, who works as a climate change photographer, had been walking in the woods when he spotted the odd set up. It looks like a romantic meal in the woods but then they couldnapost clean up after themselves,” he said. He pointed out that the couple had gone to a “lot of trouble” to carry the gear down from wherever they had come from - as it was about half a mile from the nearest road.  Staff at nearby hotels denied having anything to do with the set-up. Mr Cooper said it wasn’t unusual to see abandoned items around the area he said he had seen a number of tents, along with sleeping bags and cooking equipment, over the past  months. The region had proved popular with visitors as lockdown measures he eased, and there had been a type of visitor who had no respect for the place “whatsoever”.

By the end of the video, there is no hiding Nova’s fully developed ears as they stand all by themselves in true German shepherd style. Viewers instantly fell in love with the unique puppy, with one user commenting: “Oh my goodness, what a gorgeous happy fluff ball! Beautul little pup, please give her a treat for me and a little nose boop.” Another commenter wrote: “Sir, this is not a German shepherd, this is clearly stracciatella ice cream.” A third added: “Awwww hahaha went from border collie ears to German shepherd ears!

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

A History of Violence [later turned into a film by David Cronenberg] sees the writer depart from the sprawl of post-apocalyptic Mega-Cities to modern-day small-town America. The initial premise is a simple one, but brilliant in its execution. A reluctant hero gets his picture in the paper and is recognised by some very bad people from his past. Wagnerrsquos writing never misses a beat, building the tension up to a massively exciting and satisfying conclusion. Itrsquos accompanied by Vince Lockersquos art, which is never flashy, keeps you in the moment, and presents every scene to maximum effect. A masterpiece in storytelling.Bad CompanyPeter Milligan and Brett Ewins and othersTake a futuristic Dirty Dozen and place them in a never-ending war against a brutal alien invader. Another simple concept, but it comes alive in the hands of writer Peter Milligan. Chock-a-block with broken, warped and wonderfully evocative characters inside and out, and aided and abetted by deliriously trippy, twisted visuals by original artist, the late Brett Ewins. Unrelenting and gut-clenching. The only thing in Bad Company with a heart is darkness itself.The O menby Martin EdenThe most striking aspect of this book is its ordinariness. But thatrsquos no criticism, anything but. Normally we have a superhero team portrayed as dysal characters, who see their powers as much a curse as a blessing, with a pressing need to get together to take on a greater threat.In the O men, we have superheroes whose powers, in the face of the everyday issues, are incidental. The type of issues we all face in terms of relationships, making ends meet, looking forward to the weekend.Think of your favourite soap-cum-kitchen sink drama with a sprinkling of superhero powers. It shouldnrsquot work, but it does. Created from the febrile mind of Martin Eden it displays the full range of indie punk sensibilities.theomenix.org.ukThe Ballad of Halo JonesBy Alan Moore and Ian GibsonBest known for comic behemoths Watchmen and V for Vendetta, Alan Moore is also capable of more nuanced work. The Ballad of Halo Jones is deliberately understated and all the better for it. Set in the future, Halo Jones is an ordinary person who finds herself in extraordinary circumstances. We first find her on a shopping trip where timing is everything. Then, in desperate need of a job, she enlists as a soldier in a future war. Finally, she is lover to an all-powerful warlord.Moore is at the top of his game as he fills in the gaps. Nothing is forced. Itrsquos all about character development, and itrsquos through this that we care as well. I first read Halo Jones in the late s.

A Transporter Chief no less. Hersquos always there, ready to transport the major characters onto the surface of some alien planet or other, but never really appreciated by his peers . From such unpromising beginnings is born a cult comedy classic. Jon Adams describes it thus: ldquoFor fans of crappy jobs, space travel, and ennui. And I guess,itrsquos on this list, I must be a fan as well!The book consists of single-page comic strips with the main character always upbeat and happy to help despite the constant putdowns. OrsquoBrien remains statuesque in many of his scenes. Unmoving, someone you wouldnrsquot notice twice. The result is, by turn, unexpectantly charming, sad, and very, very funny. Chief OrsquoBrien at Work has to be read to be believed.chiefobrienatworkGood Cop by Jim Alexander is out on paperback and on Kindle and available from Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Kobo."},{"url":null,"title":"us-lift-travel-restrictions-fully-vaccinated-tourists-november-8","story":"The Whitehouse confirmed that the borders will reopening on November  which is a major boost for the UKrsquos struggling airlines, airports and travel firms.Former president Donald Trump introduced a ban on visitors coming into the USA in March  following the coronavirus outbreak.The new policy to reopenwas announced last month, but it was not previously known when in November it would be implemented.Responding to the news British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle said: ldquoNearly  days since the introduction of the US travel ban, this is a pivotal moment for the entire travel industry and finally provides the certainty we have so desperately needed.Yeeha!

Any nationwide industrial action will involve disruption to the COP climate change conference being held in Glasgow between October  and November .Last Thursday, Stagecoach confirmed it has submitted a fresh pay offer, in a bid to prevent industrial action by workers in Orkney and across the Highlands.But the union representing staff at the bus operator criticised the timing of this response, suggesting that “there is still some distance to go” when it comes to reaching a deal.Confirming its offer, last Thursday morning, Stagecoach Highlands said it hoped to break the deadlock and reach an agreement with trade union Unite.New deals will be put to Unite in talks this week, covering employees in Kirkwall, Inverness, Tain, Portree, Thurso, and Aviemore.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it. I often wonder about my uncle’s short spell in Orkney and how he celebrated his last birthday on October , .”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But were it not for Murdo Dan’s job as a joiner and Chrissie Mary doing a few shts as a carer, their economic ‘situation’ would be very dficult indeed.To supplement their income, they have decided to use their meagre savings, borrow a not insignicant sum from their local bank, and apply to stick a couple of pods on the croft.Meanwhile, Nigel and Pippa saw a croft for sale in the Sunday Times Property Section for what they thought was a snip at £k and decided to use part of a trust fund to purchase it as a commercial investment.They thought that they could also capitalise on the local tourist ‘boom’ and have applied to turn the derelict croft house into a vegan cafe and craft shop and also to stick several pods on their newly acquired croft to offer a ‘holistic getaway’ for their jet-set pals.Do you, and I certainly don’t mean to pre-judge anyone who reads this paperthink that their ‘cases’ should be treated any dferently by the local planning authorities If the answer is “yes”, then think again.Too dficult a scenario to judge Try this one.Should an application to build a couple of pods on a croft, which is basically  per cent bog, in the middle of Ranish and has no view of anywhere except adjacent croft bog, be given any additional merit over a similar application in beautul Scaristavore or Ardroil where ‘breathtaking scenery’ will be the selling tagline Wrong again.As a member of the local planning board here in the Western Isles, I’m more than well aware of what my responsibilities are and it’s certainly not to pre-judge any applications based on my own preconceptions, or prejudicesof what should or shouldn’t be allowed.I’ve to stick to the guidelines and the training I’ve been given, understand what’s expected of meand to base my decision without emotion or bias. across the front pages of this paper and others, on social media and the television news, can influence any of my our decisions.The capitalist playground which crofting tenure has now become, and the seismic change in the scale of speculation on ‘marketable’ properties available, is in danger of knocking the fragile socio-economic balance of the west of Scotland even further off its already very shoogly axis.Crofts have now become the equivalent of crypto-currency the ‘Bitcoins’ which can provide financial security for those fortunate enough to be sitting on ‘gold’.What’s being done to stabilise and bring a dose of reality to a market which threatens to get completely out of control How can single iniduals be able to own several crofts with not an intention to ‘work’ or develop any single one of them I believe that a crofting historian once said that this form of land tenure has become ‘the single biggest impediment to sustainable development in Western Scotland and the Highlands and Islands’.That wasn’t yesterday.‘Things’ are already well out of control.But who should intervene I’m not the only one who keeps asking the question.Apparently ‘we’ should legislate to address.We need, it has been suggested, to become Jersey or Guernsey.That people shouldn’t be allowed to buy homes here unless they intend to be used as a primary residence .Second homes taxation needs to increase signicantly and the additional income be used to support tourism infrastructure.From the Butt to Bodmin there have been ious proposals as to how to legislate to prevent the worst effects of tourism from destroying fragile local economies.Have any worked, andso, could they be implemented here to make any dference Let me be very clear.Tourism is hugely important to our rural economy.More so since Brexit and Covid.But I’ll say this again, at the risk of boring you all: it needs to be carefully nurtured and sustainably developed.We cannot survivewe turn our villages into ‘ghost-towns’#yes, I know…..for the winter months.We need a balance, we need the ‘tools’ with which to legislate properly and we need those charged with ‘oversight’ to take better ownership.We need, and I’ve yet to see any evidence of this, these same people to begin to take this seriously.For our future generations.They are the ones who will be impacted mostwe don’t sit up and pay attention.Now."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CATTLE-SALES-SEP-21-2-scaled.jpg","title":"remember your roots skye plan is urged to recognise","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThose were the comments of Roddy Murray, former Western Isles councillor and now the grazings clerk for Tarskavaig in Sleat, who this week voiced his concern that there was no mention of crofting at all in the ‘Skye and Raasay Future’ plan published in August with the full backing of all four local councillors.He told the Free Press: “There are  projects listed in the plan but not a single mention of crofting.

You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4157474.jpg--.jpg?1634222796000\n","title":"nipsa wants stormont department to take over management of council","story":"NIPSA has confirmed that it has written to the Minister for Communities asking that the Department takes over the managementat Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.

Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

It was quite the experience. I put a lot into it and there was highs and lows, but mostly highs.”Liam said he took the role of handling the public’s mail seriously, explaining: “Just generally, you have to have a certain amount of security about it and respect for other people. You have to ensure that things keep moving along.

I didn’t want a fuss, but there was sandwiches, cakes and buns,” he added.Delivering the post is something of a family trade for Liam, with his sons Paul and Richard based in the Omagh office and his grandson Kyle having been a postman for five years.“Richard mainly worked with me and Kyle gets his mail from the Omagh office in the morning and goes to Dromore to deliver it,” he said.One demand of the role Liam is more than happy to say goodbye to is the eye-watering early starts.“The last while, especially since Covid, I’ve been getting up for work at am and getting into work for am, driving from Donegal, then my sht would end at .pm,” he said. “The way we worked was a three-day week, doing double shts.”Now that he has extra free time on his hands, Liam is planning to get more involved with his local Gaelic football team.“I do a bit of training and I’m involved with the senior team a bit as well” he said. “I’ve a big interest in the county team as well. I’ve plenty to keep me going.”With more than four decades of memories to look back on at the Omagh office, Liam has plenty of memories, good and bad.Among the worst is Omagh’s darkest moment: the day the Real IRA blew up the town centre. The atrocity, on August , , killed  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, nine children and three generations of one family.It was the single biggest tragedy of the Troubles, and took place three months after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.“I was working that Saturday. It never leaves you. [In] the aftermath... the photographers, the post office was overrun with Press doing stories.

Credit: Europa Press via Getty ImagesOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA long time ago in a town not far away, my great grandparents, James and Annie Murphy, opened a petrol station.Murphy’s Garage, where the Pond Park Road meets the Antrim Road in Lisburn, was a trendsetter of its day. At the dawn of the motor age, they had the foresight to see the future. There was business to be had. It could well have been the first of its kind in the Co Antrim town .They passed on almost a letime ago now. They probably didn’t look far enough into the future to see the billion-dollar industry that petroleum would become.Read MoreNI fuel prices: postcode lottery for motorists as UK average per litre risesFuel, they likely figured all those years ago, would become a necessity. Sadly, those behind the big businesses that power the world around us know it’s a necessity too.I can’t survive without a car.

The suppliers know we need petrol. One plus the other equals a captive market — and we will pay whatever it takes to get what we need.I loathe paying for fuel. It’s not something I particularly want.I watch the miles-to-go dial on the instrument  of my car drip inexorably downwards. Sometimes I try and make it home without having to stop, my own little dare.These past two weeks, the world’s TV has been dominated by a new Korean phenomenon. Squid Game plays the rich against the rest. The have-nots, drained of all their money, no more than toys to amuse the haves. Squids produce oil. It might not be the sort that powers our world, but the link is there.The majority of us don our teal-green tracksuits and try to survive in the lopsided world of the few lording it over the many in a playground for the mega-rich paid for by those who can’t afford it.You wonder how they survived during lockdown.Like many, I worked from home.

An official date is expected to be announced for the resumption of transatlantic flights from Ireland and other countries to the US in the coming days but Aer Lingus have already confirmed a date for theirto transatlantic flights. googletag.cmd.push In what could be an indicator of the official date, passengers can book tickets to Newark from Dublin from as early as November  following confirmation by the airline. Aer Lingus transatlantic flights resume from Dublin to Newark from November  and Orlando from November , a statement read. Irish customers ready to travel US-bound once the travel ban is lted in November, can once again fly direct from Dublin to Newark and Orlando from November, it continued. The US announced last month that it would lt the strict air travel ban imposed on non-US citizens travelling to the country in early November. Expectation is mounting with an announcement possible before the weekend on the official date. The US has this week also announced the lting of travel restrictions with Canada and Mexico across its land borders for the same time in early November. Irish travellers will be eagerly awaiting official word to book flights to visit the likes of New York during the Christmas period but they will still be expected to adhere to some restrictions. Before travelling, Aer Lingus customers are advised to use the airline’s newonline travel support toolto search by destination and retrieve up-to-date tailored travel information based on their specic circumstances including vaccination status,travel and flight connection requirements. Should plans change, customers can also avail of the ‘Book with Confidence’ flexible booking proposition until  December , a spokesperson said.

An official date is expected to be announced for the resumption of transatlantic flights from Ireland and other countries to the US in the coming days but Aer Lingus have already confirmed a date for theirto transatlantic flights. googletag.cmd.push In what could be an indicator of the official date, passengers can book tickets to Newark from Dublin from as early as November  following confirmation by the airline. Aer Lingus transatlantic flights resume from Dublin to Newark from November  and Orlando from November , a statement read. Irish customers ready to travel US-bound once the travel ban is lted in November, can once again fly direct from Dublin to Newark and Orlando from November, it continued. The US announced last month that it would lt the strict air travel ban imposed on non-US citizens travelling to the country in early November. Expectation is mounting with an announcement possible before the weekend on the official date. The US has this week also announced the lting of travel restrictions with Canada and Mexico across its land borders for the same time in early November. Irish travellers will be eagerly awaiting official word to book flights to visit the likes of New York during the Christmas period but they will still be expected to adhere to some restrictions. Before travelling, Aer Lingus customers are advised to use the airline’s newonline travel support toolto search by destination and retrieve up-to-date tailored travel information based on their specic circumstances including vaccination status,travel and flight connection requirements. Should plans change, customers can also avail of the ‘Book with Confidence’ flexible booking proposition until  December , a spokesperson said.

Passengers must have both doses for vaccines administered in two shots. Proof of a negative test will also be required before travelling across the Atlantic.

They will receive a National Trust voucher to the value of pound. Aine and John began growing their own food this year after signing up to the National Lottery funded Acorn FarmI can growproject which involves  local families being mentored by a horticulturalist in growing their own fruit and vegetables over an-monthperiod. googletag.cmd.push Participants have received raised beds, seedlings and guidance on how to nurture their plants. Primary one teacher, Aine Kivlehan, said: Weve never won anything before, so this is a lovely surprise. Its incredibly satisfying eating a meal with ingredients grown in your garden. My son John really enjoys it too and we both find its a great way to relax. Im hoping to set up a little gardening club for some local children in the coming months to pass on some of the lessons weve learned as part of the wonderful Acorn Farm I can grow project. We are just so delighted to be part of this and to be given the opportunity to do something so positive for our environment. Having done a little bit of growing in the past, Aine was excited to see the Acorn FarmI can growprojects call out for interest to people in the Derry City and Strabane District area and signed up to be part of it. John really loves checking on the veg and watering the plants and Ive enjoyed getting some tips from the horticulturalist which Ive passed onto friends. Its lovely being able to lt something from your back garden and bring it into the kitchen to cook for dinner. It has been catching too with neighbours popping over to have a look and being inspired to give growing a go themselves.     Mayor Warke congratulated the pair, saying, It fills me with pride to see a local family like the Kivlehans doing their bit for the environment and turning their hand to growing their own food. Not only is this a lovely bonding activity for families, but it saves money and helps our environment too, reducing our reliance on importing fruit and vegetables from farther afield. This helps cut carbon emissions and eases the pressures on nature.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Ronan Coulter, of Greenvale Park, Magherafelt, entered a guilty plea to contravention of a requirement under the Health Protection regulations for Coronavirus on May  . Police had been called to Tulach Way in the town to attend reports of a possible fight and observed a number of people at a house in the area. googletag.cmd.push A woman identied as the homeowner argued no Coronavirus regulations were being breached that only four people were present and all lived at the property. When asked to bring the occupants to the door, the woman disappeared inside the house, and moments later, the defendant came to the door and spoke to police. Prosecution said Coulter had presented as being intoxicated and argumentative with police, and was issued with a fixed penalty notice under the legislation.

Rory Conway, of Roshure Road, Magherafelt, contested a charge of driving with excess alcohol on his breath at Magherafelt Magistrates Court last week. The court heard from a police constable who had attended a call from two female witnesses who had followed the defendant home along the Draperstown Road and Roshure Road on September  . googletag.cmd.push The constable told the court he spoke to the witnesses outside the property who said they had seen the defendant at a petrol station in Draperstown and observing he was driving all over the road, had followed him and called the police. After speaking with the witnesses, the constable located a car in the driveway of the house on Roshure Road, and noted the bonnet was still warm. Conways partner answered the door, and when askedthe owner of the vehicle was home, the defendant, who had been in bed, appeared downstairs. The constable noted a smell of intoxicating liquor from Conway and conducted a preliminary breath test, where a reading of mg was recorded. The defendant was then arrested and taken to custody and on leaving after police interview, said: “Boys, it would have been worseyoud got me in the car.” Defence for Conway argued that as the comment had not been taken down in the constables notebook and read and signed by the defendant, it was inadmissible in court. They also said there was no evidence of the defendant driving the car, as both his partner and father had access to it.     The constable said he was not aware of anyone  inside the property at the time, and that the witnesses had described a male suspect. Statements given by the witnesses were then partially read out in court by Judge Mullan. One witness said she had observed Conway getting out of the car and urinating against the garage, before she asked him: “What do you think youre doing ” The statement said the defendant replied “What ” and moved towards the car, prompting the witness to ask: “Where are you going  You nearly caused an accident there.” Conway replied “Im sorry, Im going to my bed,” before the witness went round the back of the house and observed him at the side window with no shirt on, looking out at them. Counsel for the defence said the details in the statement meant that the witnesses should have been able to identy the defendant as part of the Viper procedure, which they were unable to do. Summing up, they told the court the defendant had not been detected driving the vehicle, that his unsolicited comment had been inadmissible and that he had not been identied by witnesses. The prosecution submitted that Conway was the owner of the vehicle and that there were two witnesses to his driving who were so concerned they had followed him home. Police had found the bonnet of the car to be warm, had spoken to the defendant and noted there didnt appear to be anyone  in the house. It was also noted Conway did not deny the charge at interview. Judge Mullan found the defendant guilty of driving with excess alcohol on his breath, and said the failure of the defence to call Conway to give evidence was a factor in the decision. She disqualied the defendant from driving for a period of  months, and issued a fine of pound, alongside an offenders levy of pound.

Ryanair have confirmed they will operate three weekly flights between Derry and Manchester, England, from Winter . The airline have launched a seat sale to celebrate the announcement of the new route, and their Director of Commercial, Jason McGuinness, said they remain committed to growing their passenger network. googletag.cmd.push Ryanair remains committed to re-building Europe’s aviation and tourism industry by restoring connectivity and growing its network of passengers to over  million by , he said. As Ryanair takes delivery of  additional Boeing - ‘Gamechanger’ aircraft this winter, we are delighted to add this new route from Derry to Manchester. Local MLA for Foyle, Sinead McLaughlin, welcomed news of the new service. This route has long been an ambition of the airport and I congratulate the airports leadership, and Derry City and Strabane District Council as the owners, for getting this over the line, she said. Connections with Manchester are really important for our local economy, as well as being a key destination for study and social reasons. Manchester is a vibrant and dynamic city, which is becoming increasingly signicant within Britain as an economic hub. Creating business links between the two cities could be extremely beneficial for Derry. The City of Derry Airport provides important economic benefits for Derry, as well as the wider region on both sides of the border. It is essential that the Executive and the British and Irish governments provide the ongoing financial support it needs, not just to survive but to expand.

The SDLP leader said that the proposals presented by the Commission this week demonstrate generous flexibility and has called on the British Government to show the same willingness to reach an accommodation. Following the call, Colum Eastwood called on DUP Leader Jeffrey Donaldson to withdraw his threat to collapse the devolved institutions in light of the signicant movement made by EU leaders. googletag.cmd.push Colum Eastwood MP said: “We have had further useful dialogue with Maroš Šefčovič this afternoon. The SDLP is very pleased with the flexibility that the European Commission has shown and the proposals that are now on the table. It is time that we see a similar willingness to reach an honourable accommodation from the British Government. “There will now be a period of intense negotiation. That should be a constructive and relentlessly positive engagement aimed at securing a resolution. I hope that the briefing and counter briefing that has characterised previous talks, particularly in the British Press, will not come to define this negotiation. “In the spirit of seeking accommodation, Jeffrey Donaldson should now withdraw his threat to collapse devolved government in Northern Ireland. Unionism has achieved its goals, there is no further price to be extracted. Continuing to make undeliverable demands around the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is a hiding to nothing.”     ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Doherty, was a French teacher at Oakgrove College, before a combination of ill-health and redundancy left him twiddling his thumbs at home. Being an aficionado of words, he decided to put those thumbs – and fingers – to artistic use and create the spoonerism series. googletag.cmd.push Spoonerisms derive from error in speech in which corresponding letters are switched between two words in a phrase. The label takes its name from Oxford Don and cleric, William Archibald Spooner who would regularly do this. Sean, who is of the same family that own the citys famous Doherty Meats, said: “I would always do crosswords in the newspapers and I do love words. Sometimes I would spoonerise stuff in my head.  Spooner tries his luck at running a coffee shop. Pic: Sean Doherty “I started noting them down andthey amused me, I would then create wee scenarios for them. “To be honest, I couldnt draw to save myself and I am aware that the cartoons are less than professional. “I was running around trying to get quotes from people to have my cartoons done professionally but the cheapest quote I got was fty pounds a frame. “The wolves are not at the door, but I am on benefits at the minute. The house is paid for and my we is still working, but I still have two children at university so I cant be paying out that much for a professional cartoonist.     “I have a couple of hundred of drawings already created. Even to produce a set of ten would set me back five hundred quid. “I did a google search and came across a teach-yourself-how-to-do-cartoons programme. I went on there and used that to create my spoonerism characters. “The original Spooner was a nineteenth century cleric so naturally, I made one of my main protagonists a cleric as well – a bit like the Father Brown character on TV. “The we character is the one who interprets the spoonerisms, the mistakes with a for flips sake what are you at  and so on. “The cartoons Ive done are very rudimentary but I think as Ive been bouncing along, I got slightly better at it.” As mentioned earlier, Doherty has suffered with ill-health over the last few years with two bouts of Non-Hodgkins Lymphona leading him to take a redundancy offer from Oakfield College and take a break from teaching. He added: “I have had a colourful health history. I have had a number of things over the last ten years. “Im a teacher by trade having taught French at Oakgrove College. I dont do that anymore having had to take my redundancy. “I had my large bowel removed and a stoma bag installed. I recovered from that and went back to work. A couple of years after that, I had massive seizures and was diagnosed with osteoporosis. I broke a dozen bones – including my hip and backbone. “I was in hospital for a month after that. I recovered, went back to work and then I was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma cancer. That was around three or four years ago. “I was successfully treated for it. I was within a few days of being officially declared as being two years clear when I took ill again and found the Non-Hodgkins had ed. “When you get cancer once, your chances of survival are good. When you get it a second time, it can be bleak. “I was lucky enough to have a doctor who was fantastic. He got me onto a thing called Car T Cell Treatment in London. “Its a radical, new treatment, What happens there is they take a sample of your bone marrow and have it sent away to a facility the Netherlands, They convert the bone marrow to fight the cancer internally. “Unfortunately it makes you sick as a pig as you have no immune system. I was in hospital for quite a long time in London. But it was successful – so far, so good, touch wood. “I got sent back to Derry literally just before the pandemic. Im still classied as being clinically extremely vulnerable. “In the middle of all that, I was offered a redundancy from teaching. Being extremely clinically vulnerable and going into eight or nine classrooms a day with dferent sets of pupils is not recommended. “My plan A had been to work as a substitute teacher – and I would have got plenty of work being a language teacher. “But the doctor in London said to leave it until next April and then we could revisit that. For now, I was told that I was not to work as a teacher.”  Spooners Quadrophenia party takes a wrong turn. Pic: Sean Doherty While Doherty awaits for the doctors to give him the green light to resume his teaching career, the Spooner cartoons keep him busy and hopefully someone somewhere might offer him the chance to showcase his material to a wider audience. He said: “I do not claim to be some sort of great artist, but what I have managed to start doing is to give them a character, give them a continued presence and to visually represent a joke. “You might not go oh that is a wonderful cartoon there, but you might see the joke. If youre a wordy sort of a person, you will get the joke. “Of course some might not get the joke and find it funny but I do think there is a niche for spoonerism cartoons.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.         Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.         Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.         Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.”     For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCity of Derry airport welcomes a new route overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have urged the public in Derry to be vigilant towards scammersLocal NewsPolice warn Derry smartphone users of scammers overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Nadine, second from left, ACA fellow Last Singer Standing judges, Joey Fatone andSamantha Mumba, and series presenter Nicky Byrne, right.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening. The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men.     Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.  DERRY CITY: Nathan Gartside, Ciaran Coll, Eoin Toal, Cameron McJannett, Ronan Boyce, Danny Lafferty, Ciaron Harkin, Evan McLaughlin , Joe Thomson, Jamie McGonigle , Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe. ST.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening. The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men.     Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.  DERRY CITY: Nathan Gartside, Ciaran Coll, Eoin Toal, Cameron McJannett, Ronan Boyce, Danny Lafferty, Ciaron Harkin, Evan McLaughlin , Joe Thomson, Jamie McGonigle , Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe. ST. PATRICK’S ATHLETIC: Vitezslav Jaros, Shane Grfin , James Abankwah , Lee Desmond, Sam Bone , Jamie Lennon , Alfie Lewis, Darragh Burns, Chris Forrester, Billy King , Matty Smith.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

That was understandable in March , but needs to be addressed now.ldquoThe simple inadequacy of the emergency ambulance response times in this area is also a matter of grave concern. We recognise that a major element in that service failure is the y ambulance handover times that can occur at the hospitals with the centralised services.ldquoThat was to be dealt with under the Department of Healthrsquos ldquoNo More Silos document, published a full year ago. Why has that still not been addressed  he asked.Veteran hospital campaigner, Ann Trainor, has welcomed news in a letter from health officials that they are ldquoactively working on improving so-called point of care testingcapability at the Downe Hospital, which should signicantly increase service delivery in the urgent care centre.ldquoThis is good news, she continued. ldquoWe hope that progress on this will be very swt and perhaps the South Eastern Trust could explain why we are still waiting on an MRI scanner at the Downe too ldquoHoneyed words wonrsquot increase the diagnostic capability of our local hospital, one which has so much to offer on a regional basis too, but swt action will. The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision. That work must be done now and urgently and hand-in-hand with the creation of new medical workforce capacity.ldquoIt is time to build for the future and it is time for all the political parties to vigorously pursue this new investment for the Downe, the peoplersquos hospital. The people expect politicians to deliver and deliver now.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed that due to the pressures of Covid-, a small number of theatre lists at the Downe Hospital had to be cancelled in the past two weeks in order to provide staff support in the Intensive Care Unit at the Ulster Hospital.ldquoPatients who unfortunately had their procedures postponed have been rescheduled or have already had their procedures at another site in the South Eastern Trust area, she confirmed.The spokeswoman said a normal theatre schedule will resume as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Arts.jpg","title":"Downpatrick Arts Society event in St Patrick Centre  ","story":"LADY Margaret Ritchie joined members of Downpatrick Art Society as the grouprsquos st exhibition got underway at the St Patrickrsquos Centre.Over  paintings are on show encompassing a range of styles and themes, with many of the works inspired by local landscapes, while other paintings have stories to tell.Other paintings depict faraway shores to dream about and there are a few abstract works too ndash so therersquos something for everyone.The exhibition allows the artists to share their joy of painting with the public and indeed many of the paintings can be purchased to be enjoyed at home or as a gt for someone.The Society began over  years ago with four founding members and has continued to flourish as this yearrsquos exhibition proves.Prior to the Covid- lockdown, the Society enjoyed demonstrations and critiques by professional artists as well as outings and social activities and it is hoped toto these activities as the restrictions ease.Those who love painting or drawing and would like to join the Art Society should call    or leave their contact details at the reception desk in the St Patrickrsquos Centre.The new exhibition runs until the end of October between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Park.jpg","title":"East Down runners enjoy Castlewellan parkrun fun  ","story":"AFTER the huge efforts at the ious marathons last weekend, many runners were justiably taking their ease this weekend so it made for a quiet weekend on the racing front.Some East Down AC members saw this as a good opportunity to stay close to home by taking part in the Castlewellan parkrun.This is a free weekly K timed run and anyone can take part whether they belong to a club or not.If you want to appear in the results you must first obtain a bar code online at https:www.parkrun.org.uk register  and then turn up in good time for the .am start.There are around  dferent parkrun locations in Northern Ireland with new events being set up all the time.Castlewellan can claim to be one of the most scenic and it attracted  plus participants on Saturday past and whether the EDAC runners enjoyed their morning exercise or the post run refreshments more is up for debate.Ollie Robinson was first EDAC runner home possibly to ensure he had the pick of the goodies, while others were happy to run easy while taking in the beauty of the lake and trail.As promised there was ample coffee and homemade cake at the finish for our club runners and we were more than happy to share with other passers by.We may even have acquired the odd new member or two so all in all it was a successful day out. The idea is to visit a iety of locations in the months ahead.At the same time as some were having a leisurely lsquocupparsquo, three EDAC members had donned their red and yellow vests ready to take on the Cooley Coast K in Carlingford.Patrick Smith reported back that the weather was kind, the first eight kilometres was gentle and almost flat, but the last two gave them their moneyrsquos worth with a steady climb back to the finish line at the Cooley Kickhamrsquos GAC grounds.He managed to complete it in a time of .which put him in well inside the top half of the field of .Kelly Smith was ahead of him up the road as she stormed to a . which took a full minute off her previous best time.She was fth female overall which should really boost her confidence to no end.

Well done Kelly.Aine Grant who has settled in well to the club was doing her first K since Jimmyrsquos Ten in June and was well pleased to finish in  minutes. They all said that they would recommend this as a race to others in the club.Aaron McGrady had another good day on the hills on Saturday. He seems to flourish when there is hardship.He was out wearing his EDAC vest with pride at the Bradwell Fell Race in the centre of the Peak District.Not an easy one as it comprises eight kilometres and m of climbing with a profile of three steep climbs early in the race, a rolling circuit for a few km on the fell top and then a final steepdescent to the village.The conditions on Saturday were misty and cool on the tops but good for running and helped by a well marked course.The race set off fast into the first climb and Aaron settled back in and around tenth, hoping to work his way forward on the climbs.Over the top of the first climb, there were three main contenders with Aaron one of them.He took the lead on the way over the second climb and managed to put in a hard burst over the top and down the second descent.When he couldnrsquot hear the sound of the others breathing, he knew he had created a good gap so he relaxed a little on the third climb to gather some energy for the loop on the top.He was reasonably confident that he had built about a  second lead when he reached the final descent, but he gave it a good rattle anyway crossing the finish line with well over a minute to spare.Great pacing and a pleasing result.This weekend sees the Cross Country season taking the headlines with the NI Mastersrsquo Trials at Queenrsquos Playing Fields.Entries for this are now closed but those who are taking part will be vying for selection for the upcoming Home Countries event in November.Plenty of others will also be planning some off road training in order to prepare for the Bobby Rea XC which is the week after.It is great to see some recent recruits adding their name to the team entry and hopefully they will enjoy their first experience of lsquothe muckrsquo.

Three minutes later the visitors had their first effort when from Casey Courtneyrsquos long throw, Christopher McKay headed back to Courtney but his enterprising effort was wide.Villa should have been ahead in the th minute but Aaron Carberry produced an outstanding double save.The game was being played at a frantic pace with both midfields battling for supremacy with Jon Joe Sharvin and Darren McConnell linking to produce an outstanding pass for Jack Sharvin but his effort was well blocked.Soon afterwards there was almost a repeat with McConnell and Barry Walsh linking, and Jack Sharvin flashing the ball across the six yard box.Killyleagh were playing some neat football with Jonny Murray and Jon Joe Sharvin combining for Jamie Sharvin to almost thread it through for Declan McComiskey. There was time for Jamie Sharvin to stride forward and try a long range effort.The visitors have made an outstanding start to the season, reaching the quarter finals of the Steel Cup, and they knocked the ball about with confidence as they had their best spell of the game.A free kick from the impressive Arthurs was cleared for a corner in the th minute and then, six minutes later, first Jamie Sharvin blocked the effort from McKayrsquos knock down, and Jonny Murray cleared a clever short corner as Thomas Dickson prepared to strike.At the opposite end twice before the interval Jack Sharvin went close, first with a free kick on the far left and then he had an effort cleared off the line in the nd minute but in truth both teams were very evenly matched in the first half.Killyleagh took control in the second half with a midfield masterclass from Barry Walsh and Darren McConnell in particular, and McComiskey having a lot of joy down the left side.

Jack Sharvin curled the ball round his marker Hylands from the edge of the box and into the stanchion of the goal in the th minute.It was a goal worthy of winning any cup tie, at any level. For a long time it looked asit would.Killyleagh had half chances, after this, with Walsh again winning his midfield tussle with Dickson to set up Jon Joe Sharvin and then Jack Sharvin went even closer from brother Jamiersquos free kick. Villa had half chances too at the opposite end with Jake Wilson going close to an equaliser.Then came that dramatic finale. Wilson was presented with a second chance in the box after his initial effort was saved and he produced a stunning finish high into the net from a tight angle.Cue th minute pandemonium and it seemed the tie was set for extra time.But when the game was restarted Killyleagh won a corner and after two blocks at close range the ball was eventually scrambled over the line by Jon Joe Sharvin in the th minute.The huge crowd contained several former players from the first Killyleagh team to win the Border Cup in  and now Paul Sharvin will be hoping his team get a chance to match that Christmas glory.To reach the semi-finals, however, they must beat Crumlin United on November  ndash a chance to avenge an incredible - defeat when the teams last met in this competition exactly two yearsrsquo ago when Killyleagh tossed away a - half-time lead in the last nine minutes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Slieve.jpg","title":"Slieve Donard sold for £40m  ","story":"NEWCASTLErsquoS iconic Slieve Donard Resort and Spa has been sold in a poundm deal to American investors.Owned by the Hastings family since , the world famous five-star hotel has been acquired by US-based AJ Capital Partners which is planning a major upgrade.After weeks of speculation that the hotel had been sold, the news was finally confirmed last Thursday with the new owner a Nashville-headquartered real estate developer and hotel operator with more than  hotels across the US and Britain, including St Andrews in Scotland.Announcing that the Newcastle hotel has been acquired, AJ Capital also confirmed that renovation work is planned to start in October next year, with the work completed by the following spring.During the planned upgrade, the hotel will remain closed.Howard Hastings mdash the managing director of Hastings Hotels mdash described AJ Capital Partnersrsquos acquisition of the Slieve Donard Resort and Spa as ldquoencouraging news for hospitality and tourism in Northern Ireland.He said it also represented a boost for the burgeoning golf tourism industry which ldquohas been an important driver of local tourism in recent years and shows signicant growth potential in the future.Mr Hastings added: ldquoI have every confidence that AJ Capital Partners will be sympathetic to the heritage of the hotel and that, under their leadership, it will continue to flourish and maintain its reputation as an iconic destination in Northern Ireland.ldquoThis investment is a strong sign of confidence in the local market by a major international hotel operator with exciting ambitions for the Slieve Donard in the coming years.

I have a particular problem with butter balls. They are horrible, liable to crack your jaw and I remember a now long dearly departed aunt repeatedly sucking on them at church, and offering me one to sweeten a tedium I knew could only be endured with stony faced compliance.There is no amount of sexy or stylish or slick advertising, not even a nationwide campaign with Kate Moss sporting one between her teeth, that could bring back the butter ball in any way that would ever make it fashionable or appealing again to those beneath octogenarian status. Nobody but nobody could make a butter ball appealing.

Please try again later.Submitting...Head of the English department of Strathearn Grammar, Wendy has the idea for her first short story while regrouting her bathroom floorMany of them are weary and the cityscape comes to reflect this in instances of pathetic fallacy one character observes the concrete jungle as tired, “like it can’t be bothered with the afternoon either and longs for the shutters down”.She writes of characters like Mo, who did fortune telling while working at a call centre before opening a beauty parlour that is subject to paramilitaries hounding her for protection money of a bigoted teacher who objects to Celtic place names and won’t eat green sweetsof the fictional rockstar Gil Courtney for whom the Troubles are utterly irrelevant the couple obsessed by their niqab-wearing Somali neighbours and of hilarious insights into teenage besties Cath and Lauren.People stare out of their windows or go on meandering walks peering aimlessly into shop windows. Or they collect online vouchers for cheap meals at restaurants with inconvenient time constraints. This is the stuff of real le, people doing their best to cope in situations of searing isolation or emotional constipation, grieving, love-lorn, waiting for a triumph that doesn’t come, grappling with disappointment that arrives devoid of sugar-coating. Wendy with her daughter Mathilda, . The author and teacher regards motherhood as her proudest achievementNot that Erskine doesn’t do humour, she does with gusto, but she also “wants people to be moved” by her precise rendering of all the absurd tragicomedy of le as it is lived every day.Erskine, an avid fan of “s girl groups, New Wave and psychedelic music” who gets a glowing . out of  on the Rate My Teacher website for her role at the prestigious east Belfast institution that boasts alumni such as Margaret Mumfordand novelist Lucy Caldwell, dismisses the notion that the ordinary lives of the people of her native city are somehow not rich enough to make appropriate thematic material for fiction.“Somebody might say ‘Oh, you write stories about ordinary people.’ And my response is, yes, but who are these extraordinary people you are talking about  “Because strip away status and artice and we are all ordinary people. Plus, once you get to know ordinary people and understand their lives, they become extraordinary, inidual, special and just as worthy of literary analysis as some powerful hero or heroine.”Erskine, who has a massively high score on the Rate My Teacher website, has just been appointed a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queens University Belfast. She is delighted by the opportunity to help fledgling writers improve their creative effortsShe continues: “People ask of my writing, “Is everything going to be set in East Belfast ’ As though people who live in London have lives that are more complex or more exciting, by virtue of the fact that they live in a big metropolis, whereas I really do think I could write collection after collection about people who live on streets here similar to the one I live on. I think their lives are just as rich as any.”So too does she deride the notion that local fiction has some kind of moral imperative to focus on the  years of conflict that so disturbed our peace. Erskine believes that the literary imagination should have unbridled permission to roam free through whatever territory it is intent on exploring: “If you come from Northern Ireland you have an absolute prerogative to write about whatever you wish, whether that is the Troubles, the post-Troubles landscape or novels about turtles or about people playing the guitar or about landscape gardeners. “There shouldn’t be any expectation about what you decide to write about. ANGEL FACE: Wendy as a baby, long, long before literary fame beckoned“With me, what I’m thinking about is that there is no sort of homogenous Northern Ireland le where you live or whatever social class you come from doesn’t mean that your experience is any less worthy of exploration or any less profound.”She is interested in characters on the margins navigating lives that may seem nondescript from the outside, but are charged with an emotional valence, poignancy and levity so that, as Erskine intends, “people may laugh, but I also very much want them to be moved. I could write a story that is simply funny ha-ha, but that would not be true to the complexity of human experience. “In the same way to centre my literary focus solely on melancholy would also be to deny that le is an absurd tragicomedy composed of darkness and light. To go back to Blake, “joy and woe are woven fine”.“That is very much the philosophy behind the fiction I try to write.”‘QUIET STOICISM OF ULSTER PEOPLE COMPELLS ME’Erskine’s first foray into creative writing began when she was offered an afternoon off amidst her hectic schedule as head of the English department at Strathearn Grammar.Though tempted to “join the gym, volunteer in an art gallery or mooch around coffee shops reading magazines or watching make-up tutorial videos on YouTube which I endlessly love,”, she saw a Facebook ad for a six-month writing course at the Irish Writers Centre, a lofty Georgian edice on Dublin’s Parnell Square, run by The Stinging Fly magazine. She committed to it in  after submitting a story named Locksmiths, the idea for which came to her while regrouting her bathroom floor and stripping away the layers of paint and wallpaper left by previous owners of her home.It is about a woman engaged in the optimism of a DIY project while the Troubles rage on her doorstep: “I’m interested in people on the side-lines, those who aren’t the centre of attention, the lives quietly lived. There are plenty of characters like that in the collection. Quiet stoicism compells me.” ‘I LOVE THE CITY, CONCRETE, TOWER BLOCKS, STREETS, BOOKSHOPS AND MARGARITAS’Wendy had a happy childhood, and with her brother would be taken to the library once a week by their mother,who kept “random” books in the family home in Jordanstown.She inherited her mother’s love of reading, and delighted in creative writing exercises at Belfast High School, situated between Whiteabbey and Greenisland: “We used to be given a Mars bar at the end of the classwe did well, which was absolutely blissful for me.”She went on to study English at university in Glasgow before going into teaching there and then in Newcastle Upon Tyne before relocating to home, sweet home.“I always wanted to study English, because reading was my thing more than anything . I think Hemingway said that ‘the good parts of a book may be only something a writer is lucky enough to overhear, or it may be the wreck of his le, and one is as good as the other.’”Though she is a dedicated teacher who delights in her colleagues, pupils, the discussion of literature and a school she loves so much she has stayed for over two decades, as well as a much feted writer of short stories, Wendy considers her greatest achievement to date as being mum to her two children Mathilda,  and son Bobby, , whom she shares with art teacher Paul, whom she met on herto Belfast in .“I’ve never found parenting stressful, it’s been more like this joyous voyage into uncharted territory and I am very proud of the fact that my children have grown up to become two lovely human beings,” she confides.The secret to her longevity with husband Paul “Spending substantial time apart and having separate interests as well as being able to totally enjoy each other’s company. You need to be self-sufficient iniduals as well as a couple.”And despite being an enormous bookworm, who especially adores the Russian master of the short story Anton Chekov, Wendy is also something of a fashionista who stocks clobber by The Vampire’s We, Isabel Marant and western shirts in her wardrobe as well as a panoply of finds she bought on Ebay for next to nothing. Then too, when not looking cooler than any teacher has a right to in pencil leather skirts with choppy-cut silvery hair and flicky eyeliner, she loves nothing better than wandering through her native Belfast: “I love concrete. I love tower blocks and streets, browsing in bookshops and going to a nice old bar with lots of red velvet for margaritas.”QA: ‘I’D HAVE MARY SHELLY, GENE CLARK AND LOU REED TO DINNER’Tell us some of your earliest childhood memories Hearing my Mum and Dad have a conversation about how they didn’t think The Beatles were that good. Also, trying to bang an Ormeau Easter egg on the side of a chair to break it open to get the little fluffy plastic chick that was inside.School days - what subjects did you excel at and were you ever in trouble Not surprisingly, English was my favourite subject and I always loved it. I don’t think I was a real goodie-goodie though, I always liked make-up, eyeliner, back combing my hair and wearing a lipstick I remember that used to change colour. So I would have got into trouble sometimes because of my attempts at aesthetic improvement, for sure.Who in your le makes you laugh the most Probably my Mum who is . She’s very funny and has a very particular wit and original way of looking at the world. She’s very aware of the ridiculousness of things.Who is your best friend My husband of over  years, Paul.Some of your favourite books The Sound and The Fury by William Faulkner, Sea State by Tabitha Lasley and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison.Favourite film Once Upon A Time in the West, directed by Sergio Leone.If you could invite anyone from history to an ideal dinner party who would you bring and what would you serve them I would % have Mary Shelley. Then Gene Clark from The Byrds and The Velvet Underground’s Lou Reed. I’d serve a great big plate of nice breads and cheeses and meats so that I could sit and enjoy their company with minimal effort, although I think Mary Shelley was vegetarian, so no meat for her.Can you describe yourself in three words Disciplined, frivolous, observant.How much do you enjoy teaching I’ve worked at Strathearn since  and that is an indicator of how much I love the place. It’s the kind of job where every day is dferent, and there is always something interesting going on. I love the discussion of literature above all.You’ve recently been made a fellow of the Seamus Heaney Centre at Queen’s. What does this mean to you Before I began to write I’d always loved reading other people’s writing, first as a student, then as a teacher. Being a writer can be lonely, so what I really look forward to is being able to help writers, whatever their age or background, find a way to improve their creative endeavours. To collaborate with somebody on making a piece of creative writing as powerful as it can be will be a huge privilege for me.Love is...Essential.The meaning of le is...Not always apparent.Dance Moves by Wendy Erskine will be published by Stinging Fly and Picador in February ."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/12449725.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

My parents didnrsquot know I was pregnant, so I planned on getting extra scan photos for them.ldquoWhen they told me Irsquod had a miscarriage I didnrsquot believe it ndash the realisation that my baby had died hit me. I could barely stand to leave the room.As social distancing was in place staff were unable to physically comfort Ms Paskell, whorsquod been unable to bring her partner to the scan.ldquoI understand why Phil couldnrsquot be there, but I donrsquot think itrsquos right for any woman to have to go through that on their own, said Ms Paskell.ldquoI was gone for longer than expected so he called me, and I had to tell him over the phone, while he was looking after our four children at home.The next dayshe went to University Hospital of Wales alone to deliver baby Cariad who was estimated to be  weeks old when she passed away ndash and was later revealed to have Downrsquos syndrome.ldquoI delivered her on my own, said Ms Paskell, who was also grieving her grandmother whorsquod died unexpectedly in April .ldquoThe staff were very supportive ndash they allowed time with Cariad to hold her and sing to her. They made some footprints for me and I had some photos taken.     ldquoI told her how sorry I was that I couldnrsquot protect her and that I had to leave. Instead of bringing a baby home all I had was a little box with her footprints and photos.ldquoI didnrsquot deal with the aftermath very well at all ndash trying to grieve without being around my family was extremely hard.Cariad had a private funeral ndash attended only by her parents ndash at James Summers funeral home.ldquoThe funeral home was amazing ndash particularly Julie, said Ms Paskell.ldquoShe helped with everything, including reading a poem at Cariadrsquos funeral.This month would have marked Cariadrsquos first birthday ndash instead her mother is raising money for two charities: Aching Arms and Downrsquos Syndrome Association.ldquoAching Arms supported me personally, said Ms Paskell.ldquoI received a teddy bear from them, which is something to hold when my arms feel empty.

I have told one of the instructors there who is very supportive.\"OTHER NEWS:She continued: ldquoIn the UK it is estimated that one in four pregnancies ends in baby loss ndash but I donrsquot think itrsquos talked about enough.ldquoI donrsquot want anyone to feel they canrsquot say Cariadrsquos name to me or ask me about her.ldquoI am a mum to five amazing beautul children and always will be ndash Irsquom lucky enough to hold four in my arms every day and I hold Cariad in my heart. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

tips for safe student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
