He said: \u0027She was amazing, very satisfying. In the islands we don\u0027t kiss and tell, but there were no complaints in that department\u0027          Misick says their relationship fizzled out because of the long distance and he began dating the actress and model LisaRaye McCoy (pictured together in 2006), whom he married the next year. He says they broke off ties for good after McCoy spotted him chatting to Omarosa at an NAACP event and angrily demanded they end their friendship\u0027She would always give me sound advice. In fact I wish I had taken more of her advice - some things would have been different.\u0027 Omarosa has never publicly disclosed the fling with Misick, which he says took place in 2005 after she orced her first husband, Aaron Stallworth. She was a rising reality TV star at the time, having achieved infamy one year earlier as the villain of the first Season of The Apprentice. The well-connected pair first crossed paths at a charity function in New York when they were introduced by a mutual friend.\u0027Clearly there was chemistry. We chatted for a very, very longtime. She\u0027s a beautiful and amazing woman. I was attracted to her,\u0027 the ex-Premier recalled. Misick was in the US to court celebrities and well-heeled tourists in a bid to bring wealth and glamour to his sun-drenched archipelago, southeast of the Bahamas. But the smooth-talking statesman said he would end up spending the entire weekend with Omarosa, touring Manhattan and enjoying intimate nights at his suite at the plush Four Seasons Hotel. \u0027I knew who she was and she knew who I was. What struck me about her was her intellect. She was highly intelligent which is not the first thing that comes to mind with a reality star,\u0027 Misick said. \u0027She was highly knowledgeable about politics and world affairs. We had a very interesting, stimulating conversation. \u0027We were obviously mature, consenting adults who were both single at the time and we were smitten with each another. So, yes, we did spend an amazing time together.\u0027 Misick would fly back to New York just a week later with the fledgling couple enjoying a romantic dinner date at Sylvia\u0027s Harlem restaurant, famed for its soul food and celebrity clientele.             The two began their romps in 2005, meeting at a charity function in New York after the Apprentice villain orced her first husband, Aaron Stallworth (pictured together in 2004)          Misick\u0027s tenure in the Turks and Caicos ended in notoriety when he was accused of corruption by the British government who forced him to stand down in 2009 and imposed direct rule          Omarosa\u0027s first \u0027White House\u0027: Misick said Omarosa was a regular visitor to the Turks and Caicos during their six month tryst. Pictured: Misick\u0027s former $8 million mansion, nicknamed the \u0027White House\u0027Weeks later she would accompany him to Dubai, where he slipped away from official functions to entertain her at the One and Only Royal Mirage Hotel, where suites cost $6,000 a night. \u0027We were dating, to use the American term,\u0027 said Misick, who has been married three times and has six children by five different women. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say that we were monogamous - that question never came up. We were dating, we were getting to know each other and having fun. \u0027She was amazing, very satisfying. In the islands we don\u0027t kiss and tell, but without kissing and telling, there were no complaints in that department.\u0027 Omarosa was a regular visitor to the Turks and Caicos during the six month tryst, sometimes taking along her mom Theresa - who calls herself Momarosa - to enjoy the swank resorts and restaurants laid on by Misick. \u0027Her and her mother have a special relationship and they were really nice people,\u0027 he said, sitting down with DailyMailTV on the island of Providenciales, the archipelago\u0027s principle tourism hub.           \u0027She was highly intelligent which is not the first thing that comes to mind with a reality star,\u0027 Misick said. Pictured: Omarosa around the time of their tryst in 2005The lovebirds were seen together at official functions and attended the South Caicos Regatta, where Misick recalls they were caught out by the tides and got stuck on a sandbar for hours. \u0027We just chilled and enjoyed the moment,\u0027 he said with a smile. \u0027We would have had catering on the boat, strawberries, grapes, fruits, champagne, beer, whiskey. And seafood - fish, conch, lobster.\u0027 He added of their time together: \u0027Most of the time it would be three or four days or a long weekend. We would either stay at a resort or my residence.\u0027Omarosa enjoyed the water. She loved the beach, she loved to swim, she loved boating. \u0027She was not a big drinker but of course everyone loves champagne. She respected the office that I had so she never did anything improper while she was with me. \u0027She was a fun person but she wasn\u0027t a wild, party crazy type of woman. I\u0027ve clearly dated those types as well, but she was not one of those. \u0027I never saw her indulge in over-drinking or drugs or anything like that. I think she could have made a good First Lady.\u0027 Misick, who married this year for the third time, says he was impressed by Omarosa\u0027s networking skills and contacts in the world of celebrity and politics. The Howard University alumnus had previously worked in the office of Vice President Al Gore during the Clinton administration, though she was later panned by her former administrator as the \u0027worst hire we ever made\u0027. Determined to transform the Turks and Caicos into the \u0027Monte Carlo of the Caribbean\u0027, Misick asked Omarosa to help raise his profile in the US, particularly among his key tourism demographic of wealthy African Americans.\u0027I would ask her the best way to market our destination,\u0027 he said. \u0027She\u0027s a very strong, powerful and opinionated woman. I\u0027m not intimidated by a strong women, I embrace strong women. \u0027She would give her advice and sometimes it was strong but ultimately as the person who was the leader of the country, it was my decision to make.\u0027           Trump and Omarosa have fallen out bitterly since her abrupt departure from the White House, with Omarosa aiming a series of barbs at her former boss in her best-selling memoir, Unhinged          Misick said he believed Omarosa and Trump were \u0027friends\u0027 with a \u0027love hate relationship\u0027. He added: \u0027Clearly something happened and he wanted her out of the White House so maybe the circumstances made her change her loyalty\u0027 Misick told DailyMailTV he also discussed Omarosa\u0027s time on The Apprentice with her - and her relationship with Donald Trump, who would later appoint her director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison. The pair have fallen out bitterly since her abrupt departure from the White House, with Omarosa aiming a series of barbs at her former boss in her best-selling memoir, Unhinged. She also alleges that tapes exist dating back to their time together filming The Apprentice in which the President is caught on mic using the N-word.\u0027They were friends. They seemed to have a love hate relationship. She was a Democrat at that time and maybe he was at the time as well, I don\u0027t know,\u0027 recalled Misick. \u0027I was not surprised he chose her to be part of his government.

Clearly something happened and he wanted her out of the White House so maybe the circumstances made her change her loyalty. He added: \u0027I can\u0027t recall whether she ever told me that Mr Trump used the n-word. I know Mr Trump as well, I\u0027ve gone to events at his estate, Mar-a-Lago. \u0027At one stage we were talking to them about hosting the Miss Universe pageant. In all my interactions with him he\u0027s been very respectful and I\u0027ve certainly not heard him use the N-word.\u0027 Misick says his relationship with Omarosa fizzled because of the long distance between them and he began dating the actress and model LisaRaye McCoy, whom he later married in 2006 but orced two years later. He says they broke off ties for good after McCoy spotted him chatting to Omarosa at an NAACP event and angrily demanded they end their friendship.           \u0027We were dating, to use the American term,\u0027 said Misick, who has been married three times and has six children by five women. The lovebirds were seen together at official functions and attended the South Caicos Regatta, where Misick recalls they were caught out by the tides and got stuck on a sandbar for hours          Last year Omarosa married Florida-based pastor John Allen Newman (pictured together in 2016) and became First Lady of his downtown Jacksonville churchOmarosa subsequently began dating Green Mile actor Michael Clarke Duncan who died of a heart attack in 2012. Last year she married Florida-based pastor John Allen Newman and became First Lady of his downtown Jacksonville church.Misick, meanwhile, was linked to a string of high-profile US actresses and celebs including Rocsi Diaz, best known as the co-host on the BET show 106 \u0026amp Park, and Nicole Murphy, ex-wife of comedian Eddie Murphy. He also built himself a sprawling $8 million mansion, nicknamed the \u0027White House,\u0027 which the British government now accuses him of funding through graft. Misick was appointed Premier of the Turks and Caicos in 2003, taking charge of a country with limited infrastructure and few modern amenities.His supporters say he oversaw a period of massive growth, developing hotels, resorts and establishing it as an A-list vacation spot. But after a landslide second election win in 2007 he demanded the island\u0027s British-appointed Governor begin the process towards a referendum on independence from the UK. British officials responded by launching an investigation into Misick that accused him of ushering in massive corruption and \u0027a palpable climate of fear\u0027. They also questioned how someone with declared assets of $50,000 when he came into power could be living a playboy lifestyle complete with Presidential-style mansion and leased private jet.           Misick was put on trial in December 2015 for fraud, bribery and money laundering in a case that has been dragging on ever since, costing its citizens an estimated $1 million every month          In 2009 the UK declared a national emergency, suspending the constitution and taking back control of the island. Misick and other ministers were accused of financing lavish lifestyles by acquiring publicly-owned land and selling it to developers. Before charges were brought, Misick moved to Brazil where his claim for asylum was rejected and he was handed over to Interpol to be returned to the Turks and Caicos. He has spent the last three years on trial in a court case which is estimated to be costing the country of just 31,000 inhabitants around $1 million a month. \u0027I just couldn\u0027t accept that you can get elected and then you have some civil servant from England come and dictate to you how you should run your country,\u0027 he told DailyMailTV.\u0027I found that offensive then and I still find that offensive. We know what\u0027s best for our country - we want to be free.\u0027Misick has described his nation\u0027s official status as a British Overseas Territory as a \u0027relic\u0027 of colonialism and alleges his prosecution is a racially-driven political witch-hunt.\u0027As a matter of fact, the then-governor in a cable to London said, \u0027we have to stop Misick now because he\u0027s popular and he wants independence. And unless we stop him now, nothing will stop him.\u0027          Misick also hopes to add Omarosa\u0027s Unhinged to his reading list in the coming weeks. \u0027I haven\u0027t read her book as yet. I\u0027m waiting for an autographed copy,\u0027 he joked\u0027So they used that as an opportunity to make these allegations of corruption.

The Palm Court Hotel, which closed last year, was one of the country\u0027s worst guesthouses with shocking reviews by unhappy guests on TripAdviser          Before being purchased for £500,000 by The Libertines last year, the hotel, with its badly patterned bedspreads, earned just one star out of five on TripAdviser  Put off by the garish decor, one guest complained about bedbugs while another blasted: \u0027This is a \u0027truly ghastly place to stay… we would have had better facilities if we had camped out\u0027A friend of the band has posted a series of YouTube videos of the building work in April, July and September showing how far the project has got to go.A recording studio being built in the basement and bars throughout look almost finished while other areas look some way off completion.  The group bought the five-storey hotel early last year and needed at least the same amount for extensive renovation work, which has been ongoing since the start of the year.According to approved plans submitted to Thanet District Council, the first, second and third floor will remain and the hotel will have seven en-suite rooms.The biggest difference is on the ground floor and basement, where there used to be hotel rooms and a dingy restaurant area for serving breakfast and evening meals. Now the ground floor will have one large and one small recording studio, both with control rooms, an isolation booth and a reception area.A new ground floor, single storey extension will house a bar with seats and tables.  The band have also been given permission to use the site for music from 8am to midnight, Monday to Saturday, and until 9pm on Sundays, which may concern some of the neighbours.A council environmental health report stated as such, saying: \u0027This appears to be a change of use from a building connected to a hotel to a music studio. My immediate concerns over this transfer are around noise transfer to surrounding residential.\u0027 Despite noise fears, planning consent was still given.Councillor for Cliftonville West, Emma Dawson, says that people shouldn\u0027t be scared of the band taking over the hotel.She says: \u0027It\u0027s really a good thing that artists who are famous are calling Margate their home. We\u0027re pretty tolerant in this area, people don\u0027t mind who they are, we need to have the new energy.\u0027Property is cheaper down here, it\u0027s right by the sea, they\u0027ve got a lovely outlook - what better setting to write songs? They have that freedom, the weather is better than anywhere else.\u0027People shouldn\u0027t be scared, obviously, we don\u0027t want to hear them until two or three in the morning. But I understand recording studios are cushioned and you can\u0027t hear anything on the outside. There\u0027s a few studios now in the area, it\u0027s becoming trendy and acceptable.

Once known as pygmy chimps, these primates are the closest thing we have to a living ancestor. Certainly, they resemble us more than the common chimp. They are fine-boned, with pink lips, proportionately long legs on which they can walk upright and hair that falls into a neat centre parting.However that prissy hair-do is misleading. Bonobos are, as is well known, shameless sexual gluttons, especially the females. They wander around in a girl gang and, when they fancy a bloke, go up and put their arm around him. If he moves away the female follows him for a bit. Pretty soon, though, she gets exasperated by his coyness and turns to one of her girlfriends instead. Together they have a lovely time, rubbing their enlarged clitorises together, with murmurs of pleasurable excitement. If a boy wanders up at this point, he’s likely to be seen off with an exasperated nip for being far too late to the party.Martin argues that we should all be a bit more bonobo (minus the nipping, obviously). Our cousins can teach us a lot about how human sexuality operated before it was corralled into an essentialist narrative about men being “naturally” polygamous while women “instinctively” seek out their one and only. Of course, this call to revision is not uniquely Martin’s. Although she has a PhD in anthropology from Yale, she remains a journalist, reporting and synthesising the work of such pioneering fieldworkers as Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Meredith Chivers, Alicia Walker, Cacilda Jethá and many more.Some of Martin’s authorities, such as Brooke Scelza of UCLA, work with human subjects. Scelza’s research on the semi-nomadic Himba tribe of Namibia provides a window into alternative ways of dealing with what anthropologists call “extra-dyadic sexuality” (AKA consensual cheating). With the Himba men periodically away at remote cattle stations, their wives keep busy by “going to the far place to collect water” – another way of saying they bunk off to meet their lover. If a baby is the result, no one sees any reason to fuss: the child will simply have two dads (AKA partible paternity). Indeed, Scelza reveals that those Himba women who are particularly keen on going to collect water end up with more and healthier children than those few who to decide to stay “true” to their husbands. Might we actually be looking at a state of affairs, Martin asks, where, from an evolutionary point of view, a woman’s insistence on monogamy starts to seem just the tiniest bit selfish?Those who have a nodding acquaintance with work on what evolutionary biologists call “female choice” will doubtless be worried that Martin has simply cherry-picked the examples that support her argument, while passing silently over all those thousands of studies that don’t show research subjects behaving in ways we’re used to: prudent egg-guarding females, and splashy seed-scattering males. One also wonders whether this material, invigorating though it is, quite counts as the “new science” that is trumpeted by the publicity. Some of this work, including that by the pioneering biologist Hrdy, dates back to the 1980s.The tone and structure are awkward, with the interviews with academics mixed with case histories of women who have chosen to break cultural taboos by openly sleeping with a secondary partner while retaining their primary relation (the trick is being handy with shared Google calendars). But the problem with these mostly pseudonymised case histories, in which, Martin tells us, “I have changed many specifics”, is that they sit uncomfortably alongside reports of scholarly work where to change a “specific” would be to invalidate the whole process. Indeed, after an earlier book, Primates of Park Avenue, about life in New York, Martin faced criticism for playing around with details. What are the rules for this kind of popular reportage? To stick to the factual record while protecting privacy through anonymising the case histories, which is how it works in academic science, would be to sacrifice any hope of the work being “relateable” to the general reader. And relateability – the call to rethink one’s own dilemmas by hearing about others’ – is the engine that drives Untrue.Martin’s own attempt at fieldwork is marked by a counterproductive coyness. In particular she simmers over something called the Skirt Club, a gathering where carefully invited straight women meet for a night of lesbian sex. Everyone seems to be clean and rich and thin. Eventually Martin wangles an invitation – we knew she would – and proceeds to describe toe-curling encounters along the lines of “her breasts strained against the plunging neckline of her tight nude pleather dress”. By which time we have strayed a long way from “female choice” and into a novel by Jackie Collins.• Untrue: Why Nearly Everything We Believe about Women, Lust and Infidelity Is Untrue is published by Scribe.

The UK brigade, including Aviva Investors, Columbia Threadneedle, L\u0026ampG, M\u0026ampG, Royal London and Schroders, have been commendably open in saying they will vote against the company’s plan to re-domicile in the Netherlands.These fund managers have probably spoken up for two reasons. First, they judge that public declarations may help to defeat a proposal they think is rotten. But the second reason is surely more important. Unilever is a long-established FTSE 100 company and its high-profile attempt to move the headquarters to Rotterdam has generated huge interest beyond the City. In those circumstances, fund managers are expected to have an opinion and to defend it. The customers are watching, as L\u0026ampG’s statement acknowledged. It took “the unusual step” of declaring its vote in advance due to “significant client enquiries about our position”.And here’s the firm’s message to people whose votes it will, in effect, be casting: we’re not telling you anything, you can find out how we voted afterwards.The policy is never to disclose voting intentions in advance and never to make exceptions. It doesn’t matter if, as at L\u0026ampG, customers have strong opinions about how they’d like their holdings to be voted. The policy is the policy.Arrogant? Aloof? Yes, but BlackRock’s stance is also surprising. Most of its funds are invested passively so Unilever’s proposal lands directly on its patch. The near-certainty that the consumer goods giant, currently Anglo-Dutch, would be ejected from the FTSE 100 and FTSE All-share is one of the highly contentious elements of the plan. Other tracker funds are protesting about becoming forced sellers. BlackRock may have a different view of how passive investment works, but it is the biggest beast in the tracker world. You’d expect it to join the debate at least.What’s more, BlackRock is forever preaching to others about the virtues of “engagement”. Larry Fink, founder, chairman and chief executive writes an annual “dear CEO” open letter to corporate leaders and, if you can get past the holier-than-thou tone, some of the content is excellent. Here’s a rousing passage from this year’s sermon: “Just as the responsibilities your company faces have grown, so too have the responsibilities of asset managers,” wrote Fink. “We must be active, engaged agents on behalf of the clients invested with BlackRock, who are the true owners of your company.”Yes, that’s right, you are merely an agent. The real owners are the people whose fees pay your wages – a mighty $28m in Fink’s case last year. But the “responsibilities” of asset managers, as BlackRock sees things, do not extend to welcoming the clients’ views. It’s a very one-way version of engagement.It would, of course, be impractical for any big fund manager to consult with clients on everything. There are thousands of votes every day at thousands of companies around the world. And, legally, an end-investor is handing over voting rights when he or she gives an investment mandate. But common sense is also required in genuinely unusual situations.Here, for example, is a specific wrinkle in the Unilever case. Are BlackRock’s UK tracker funds allowed to vote differently from BlackRock funds that track the Eurostoxx 500 index? It’s a fair question because the end-investors may well have different views: if the resolution passes, one set of investors won’t own any Unilever shares while the other will own more. BlackRock normally imposes a global house view on all its funds but “carve outs” are technically allowed. Will the carve-out clause apply at Unilever? BlackRock won’t even volunteer that information."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/813cc622d51ddc6b79a233529463e42f4418458b/0_187_5075_3046/master/5075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c882f2973c2484237ffad58bae79868","title":"brexit stay engaged eu","story":"If we really have to leave the EU, voters must force MPs to come together on the things that matterDear Mariella, I have a problem.I can’t stand any more Brexit. I tear up newspapers. I scream and e for the TV off button. I have already smashed one radio. I crouch in a foetal position, banging my head against the wall. I fear my wife will leave me. And politics is my business. What can I do?Dear Simon, Pull yourself together. You are one among millions. But Brexit is going to happen next March, and you know it. Switching to Radio 3 will not help. Look on the bright side. What you write actually matters. People care. So back to basics, remind us of the difference between Canada plus and Norway minus?The truth is that wherever I go, into a Welsh butcher’s shop, in a London pub, at a school gate or in a bus queue, the topic of conversation is the same. What about Brexit? It is a national fixation that has become more intense and lasting than any World Cup or royal wedding. Worse, no one has recourse to tribe, to “I always voted at my party’s call, I never thought of thinking for myself at all.” The parties are split. The tribes are in turmoil. Britain is a nation of thinking zombies.Much has been made of the BBC Today programme losing 800,000 listeners in a year. The assumption is that people are fleeing news about Brexit, and bad news in general. This adds to a wider fear of the rise of populism and the decline of democracy, on which books are now two a penny. A YouGov poll this week even declares a national “empathy crisis”, with over half of respondents noting a “decline in empathy towards others”. We hate each other, doubtless because of Brexit.Pollsters find both leavers and remainers bored by the subject. But being bored by a decision you have just taken is not a permissible liberty. Nor do I think voters really are bored. The topic is seething. Newspaper online readership is buoyant. The Today programme only lost listeners it had apparently added during the referendum. The surest way to pack a public meeting is to talk Brexit. The public conversation may be monotonous, but the ruling obsession is plain.That said, I now detect a sense of panic. What have we done, and what can we do about it? With the usual conduits between public opinion and power blocked because power has disintegrated, we are left staring into space. The crucial question – what did voters really mean by Brexit? – gets no answer. We are left only with opinion polls and media chatter.YouGov earlier this year found a narrow majority regarded Brexit as a mistake, but agreeing it should go ahead, broadly along customs union lines. This tallies with polls since 2016, showing that the motive for Brexit had nothing to do with trade, but was over immigration. Detailed work by John Curtice for NatCen likewise showed people wanting free trade with Europe, but some form of immigrant restriction, mostly over access to welfare. This accords with Theresa May’s own direction of travel, from Chequers to Brussels, with her emphasis passing from customs union (short- or long-term) to some deal on people movement.I have become a reluctant adherent to leaving the EU, but I regard rejecting the single market as like climate change denial. Hence my anger at “equal time” being granted by the BBC to every no-deal Tory MP, allowed to yah-boo any item of news remotely favourable to a deal with Brussels. The corporation cannot tell balance from proportion. The crucial details of single-market membership are deafened between the shrieking polarities of no-deal and remain. It is barking Boris Johnson against a “vassal state”, a travesty of the real choices facing Britain.The obligation to continue this debate through the forthcoming winter passes to parliament. At first sight, this should be fine. Labour has declared itself for continued membership of the customs union. So too has the cabinet, for the time being, under Chequers. There is no shred of evidence that a “trade deal with the rest of the world” could remotely compensate for abandoning the customs union. No Full Fact, no Reality Check, no thinktank has been able to suggest it. But with the two parties hurling insults at each other, it is hard to see them jointly fastened to this rock of agreement.So it must be over to inidual MPs to mobilise the necessary coalition. A parliament openly united behind a customs union would be in a vastly stronger position to negotiate a sensible deal on migration with the EU. It is the one single-market compromise over Brexit that the EU has to acknowledge. That is the message public opinion must somehow communicate to parliament and on to Brussels.There were always two stages to Brexit, the referendum and its implementation. The first was for voters, the second for parliament. But with MPs dithering and squabbling and fighting for ambition, voters must sustain their sovereignty.

The attacks come in all shapes and forms – targeting an inidual’s personal account of harm, a workplace’s initiative, a researcher’s methodology, or a government policy. These attacks are often insidious, with the fear of losing power dressed up as a legitimate concern about “reverse discrimination” or “an attack on fair process”. The loud voices of those who hold the power invariably come forward under the guise of hailing a return to sensible, rational discussion returning balance to a debate that has tipped “too far” in the favour of the “feminist agenda”.The common response to these forms of backlash is to see the popular majority waver. They pause and look at each other, questioning whether, in our efforts to advance gender equality, we are “tipping the scales” too much in favour of women. Whether, perhaps, it’s all gone too far.We have not gone too far. As long as sexual harassment remains closeted because women fear coming forward as long as victims of sexual assault do not report for fear of the judicial process as long as young girls are taught to sit down and not stand up, as long as powerful men get to rise to even higher ranks despite the harm they have caused as long as “me too” can only be said among our friends and on our social media but not in our workplaces or in our halls of power: we have not gone too far. We have not even started.Following the challenge to Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the US supreme court and the extraordinary testimony of Dr Christine Blasey Ford, we will inevitably see the majority waver. Backlash to feminism, or opposition to initiatives designed to advance women’s rights and social status, is nothing new. Those who fear change react by focusing new energy into maintaining their privilege. Opposition has taken various forms throughout history and in different national and cultural contexts. The seed is planted by those who risk losing power – those men who have a long and rich history of assuming power with no regard to their past or even current actions.That seed will threaten to fester it will be disseminated through opinion pieces and conservative news media, through office watercooler chats and message threads. It is a seed that is planted in fear – the fear of losing power fear of seeing tens then hundreds and then thousands of other women come forward with the stories that they know are waiting in the wings. Fear of a shift in the dynamic that takes away from men something society has told them for all of their lives that they are entitled to and can expect: power.We should be poised for this backlash, not surprised or even outraged. We should expect it to take many forms – including from women, as has been seen through movements such as Women Against Feminism (as distinct from the ever-brilliant satirical Woman Against Feminism Twitter account, @notofeminism) and the current support for Kavanaugh from high-profile Republican women. That is not to say that a movement should be immune from criticism from the inside – indeed, most social movements have involved important discussions and, at times, tension about intersecting forms of oppression. Those challenges are equally important and cannot be framed as a “distraction” from the cause rather, the cause must be strong enough to handle critiques from both inside and out. In embracing backlash we need to recognise, too, that this stance comes from a place of relative power the ability to challenge the status quo is not a luxury that all women or people coming from a place of powerlessness can enjoy.But we should not – more so, we cannot – waver. We should reject the narrative that the movements we are seeing are making the situation worse that progress is being reversed. Change is not linear, and the retaliation may look like regression.

Previously studying ancient textiles using radiocarbon dating and dye analysis required physical samples to be taken.Dr Joanne Dyer, a scientist in the museum’s department of scientific research who developed the approach, said: “It was exciting to find that the different coloured stripes found on the child’s sock were created using a combination of just three natural dyes.”The technique, details of which are published this week in the open-access journal PLOS ONE, looks at the luminescence of different dyes and uses digital microscopy to examine fibres. It allows many more textiles to be examined, adding a rich layer of discovery to the understanding of how events in this period affected people.“It means we can look at more, and a larger variety of, objects. We can see the relationship between more objects and different time periods,” said Dyer. “Late antiquity is a very long period, from 200AD to 800AD. Within that period in Egypt there are lots of thing happening. There is the Arab conquest of Egypt, the Romans leave Egypt. These events affect the economy, trade, access to materials, which is all reflected in the technical makeup of what people were wearing and how they were making these objects.”While socks have been around since the stone age, when cavemen used pelts or animal skins, the ancient Egyptians are thought to be responsible for the first knitted socks, styling them with one compartment for the big toe and another for the remaining four toes to accommodate their use with sandals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a9f9cbb7d695d8d3fd9993cc340d67b22ff4cd5/0_0_700_700/master/700.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfeab60c220ddde61485ef4d410c5bfe 1010w","title":"fan bingbing mysterious disappearance chinese film star elite","story":"Three months ago, one of the country’s best known actors went missing. Now, seemingly chastened, she has reappeared with a bill for £112m in unpaid taxes and finesImagine if Jennifer Lawrence or Scarlett Johansson went missing and nobody knew where they had gone – even three months later. That is what happened to Fan Bingbing.Fan is one of China’s best known and highest-paid actors, thanks to a string of domestic hits such as Cell Phone and Double Xposure, and small roles in Iron Man 3 and X-Men: Days of Future Past. The 37-year-old was on the jury of the Cannes film festival last year, and is set to star in a new thriller opposite Jessica Chastain and Penelope Cruz.On 2 July this year she posted details of a visit to a children’s hospital in Tibet on Weibo (China’s answer to Twitter). Then her account went dead, leaving her 63 million followers, and pretty much the rest of China, wondering where she had gone. Had Fan been abducted? Arrested? Was she just taking a career break? The questions piled up, then tipped over into conspiracy theory. There were baseless rumours she and husband Li Chen gambled away $12m (£9.2m) in three days in Las Vegas. That she was being held in a military prison in Beijing after having an affair with Chinese vice-president Wang Qishan. “Someone is trying to use Fan Bingbing to get to Wang Qishan,” exiled businessman Guo Wengui told reporters. Fan strenuously denied the affair and was suing Guo at the time of her disappearance. Jackie Chan, who had starred with Fan in his 2016 movie Skiptrace, denied all knowledge of Fan’s whereabouts.The most credible rumour may have been that Fan was in trouble with the tax office, which is not quite as prosaic as it sounds. Shortly before her disappearance, the popular TV presenter Cui Yongyuan posted on social media what appeared to be two separate contracts for Fan’s work on her forthcoming movie Air Strike, starring Bruce Willis. One contract was apparently for 10m yuan (£1.3m) the other for 60m yuan (£7.6m). The implication presumably was that this was a “yin-yang contract” – two for the same job. The smaller figure, it was implied, was declared to the tax office the larger one purported to indicate what the star was actually paid. Fan denied the allegation, and Cui promptly retracted it, but the authorities reportedly began to investigate shortly before Fan went off the radar.This Wednesday, the mystery was apparently partly explained with the news that Fan and her companies had been ordered to pay 883m yuan (£112m) in unpaid taxes and fines. She has not been charged with any crime.Fan’s first public communication since July was a grovelling confession on Weibo: “For a long time, I did not distinguish between national, social and personal interests,” she wrote. “As a public figure, I should abide by the law, and play a leading role in society and industry … Without the good policies of the party and the state, and without the love of the people, there would be no Fan Bingbing.” In short, Fan seems to have been made an example of.China’s movie industry has mushroomed over the past decade. In 2007, its total box office was just over 3bn yuan (£335m) last year it was 56bn yuan (£6.4bn). It is poised to overtake the US as the world’s biggest film territory. This explosion has brought in a new breed of moneyed celebrity, some of whom have no inhibitions about its wealth.Three years ago, for example, the nation was gripped by the wedding of high-profile actor Huang Xiaoming to Hong Kong-born Yang Ying – AKA Angelababy, who is often considered China’s answer to Kim Kardashian (Kim has 118 million followers on Instagram Angelababy has 96 million followers on Weibo). The event, which was livestreamed on the internet, was like a royal wedding, with a comparable budget – an estimated $31m (£24m). There was a 10ft wedding cake, a holographic castle, a $1.5m (£1.1m) wedding ring, a custom Dior dress that took five months to make and goodie bags including mobile phones for the 2,000 guests.More than the regulatory crackdown, it is the nature of Fan’s disappearance that has sent a jolt through Chinese society. According to reports, Fan was detained at a “holiday resort” in Wuxi, under a 2013 legal framework known as “residential surveillance at a designated location”. It is essentially a legalistic euphemism for disappearance and forced detention. “In practice it often means someone is held in secret and denied all contact with the outside world,” says Michael Caster, a human rights advocate and editor of The Peoples Republic of the Disappeared, a collection of first-hand accounts of victims of such forced detentions. “Many of them were subject to one form of torture or another, from prolonged sleep deprivation to physical pain, beatings, stress positions, mental abuse and threatening family members.” In many cases, the outcome is forced confessions.Until now, forced detentions have been used against suspected political dissidents and human rights defenders, such as Caster’s former colleague, lawyer Wang Quanzhang, who went missing in 2015 and has not been seen since. In another case, Chen Yong, a driver for a Fujian official, disappeared in April. A month later, his family were told he was dead.Applying such blunt force to the entertainment industry would be new, but not entirely out of character. “President Xi Jinping has made it very clear that he wants to do away with elites and the fetishism around money and certain forms of power,” says Caster. “If you have people looking to what celebrities do and say online versus what the party dictates, that may be very plausibly part of it. Anything that rises to a level of social, economic or political power is seen as a threat to the supremacy of the Communist party.” We are unlikely to ever know what exactly Fan Bingbing underwent, but the implication is clear: if the authorities can get to the biggest celebrity in the land, they can get to anyone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df147d482450f7df8f513e4b240262260a83092c/0_0_4499_2700/master/4499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52d9eecb54bd2c33fb787db23d1128ce","title":"stanley kubrick exhibition uk design museum london clockwork orange","story":"London to host 2019 tribute to film-maker behind The Shining and A Clockwork OrangeA Stanley Kubrick exhibition that has toured the world from Germany to Mexico to South Korea but never been to the country he called home is finally arriving in the UK.The Design Museum in London has announced details of a exhibition next year that will be devoted to the film-maker. There will also be a Kubrick season at the BFI and programmes and films on BBC TV and radio.Alan Yentob, the former BBC creative director and a friend of Kubrick who played a key role in getting the show to London, said next spring would be a “festival of Stanley”.The show will mirror one which began at the Deutsches Filmmuseum in Frankfurt in 2004 and travelled to 16 cities across the world. It has never been to the UK, Kubrick’s adopted home and the place he made most of his films. The Vietnamese countryside around the Mekong Delta in Full Metal Jacket, for example, is the Norfolk Broads the bombed out city of Hue was created at Beckton.The exhibition will borrow heavily from the Kubrick archive at the University of the Arts London and is coming together with the support of Kubrick’s brother-in-law and executive producer on many of his films, Jan Harlan.He began working with Kubrick in 1969 on his unrealised film Napoleon. It has become known as the greatest movie never made, but Harlan said an HBO TV series based on Kubrick’s research for the film, masterminded by Steven Spielberg, directed by the recently appointed Bond 25 director Cary Fukunaga, and written by playwright David Auburn, was close.“What fascinated Kubrick about Napoleon is that he is a modern character. Hugely charismatic, colossally successful, utterly vain and foolish. He ruined himself and there was nobody to blame but himself. Intelligence, talent, charisma is no guarantee of success. For Kubrick, it was a current affairs programme, not a history lesson.”The new Napoleon may be different to Kubrick’s but that’s fine, said Harlan. “Of course it will be different. Cary Fukunaga is a different director but a very good one, he is a brilliant man.”The London show will feature props, costumes, films and scripts and shine light on a director who was demanding and driven. It will explore his work with designers including Hardy Amies, Eliot Noyes, Ken Adam and Saul Bass, whose creations for The Shining poster went through 300 versions before Kubrick was happy.Harlan said Kubrick was difficult, but he was more difficult on himself. There is a popular image of Kubrick as an obsessive recluse, secluded on his Hertfordshire estate near St Albans.While that is not the whole story, Harlan revealed that Kubrick came to his New Year’s Eve party 20 years in a row because “he knew he would meet the same people. To be asked: ‘Oh I didn’t understand the ending of 2001’… that just embarrassed him.”Many things in his films happened by chance, Harlan said. For example, Kubrick was hunting around for music for 2001: A Space Odyssey and Harlan randomly put Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra on the record player. Itbecame one of the most famous pieces of film music.Yentob said serendipity also played a part in the Kubrick exhibition coming to London. He was seeing Harlan off at St Pancras train station and they were chatting about how crazy it was that the touring show had never been to the UK. Yentob said the Design Museum, in its new home at the former Commonwealth Institute in west London, would be perfect.Within two minutes, by chance, Yentob said he bumped into the Design Museum director Deyan Sudjic, who was also at the station. He agreed straight away.Yentob said Kubrick was not a megalomaniac. “He had an ability to distil the chaos, to find a way through, to ask the questions … he was always wanting to learn.”To coincide with the exhibition, the BFI will present in April to May what it has called the “definitive Stanley Kubrick season” showing his films in celluloid using projectors. There will also be a new print of A Clockwork Orange.• Stanley Kubrick: the Exhibition will be at the Design Museum in London from 26 April until 17 September 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a81a613a626b856346b97f62ac4c0c8042be345/0_353_2598_1558/master/2598.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f1ae8421e022565f0ff8f60e42dd8c3","title":"working girl power suits female ambition modern equivalent","story":"The 80s movie celebrated women striving to get ahead. Now 30 years on, Hollywood seems to want to put women in their placeThe women in Working Girl looked amazing in their power suits. How do professional female characters dress now? Cyrus, by emailI like the cut of your jib, Cyrus! Any man who spends his evenings not just watching but RE-watching Working Girl is welcome to sit by me. And you are right, women don’t wear power suits in movies any more, but that is because women in real life don’t wear power suits these days. In fact, one of the most interesting fashion stories told in Working Girl, aside from that it really is possible to pay $6,000 for an item of clothing and “it’s not even leather”, is that you can see the power suit changing shape in this late-80s movie, shifting to something decidedly more 90s. Whereas Tess (Melanie Griffith) and Cynthia (Joan Cusack) wear big shoulders and heavy jackets, Katherine (Sigourney Weaver), the woman with the real power, wears far more minimalist, slimmed-down suits. As Tess gains power, she does, too. In the last scene, Tess turns up to her new job, which she thinks is a secretarial position, in a heavily shoulder-padded jacket. But when she realises she is actually the boss, the jacket starts to slip off her shoulders. It’s 1988, baby, and a new era is beginning: no longer do big shoulders symbolise female power.(Whether then having Harrison Ford then pack Griffith’s ickle wickle lunch box for her, as if she were his toddler daughter instead of his extremely impressive girlfriend, symbolises female power is a question we shall have to save for another day.)But your question touches, I think, on something that goes beyond suits, Cyrus. The question isn’t what do ambitious women wear in the movies these days, it’s why aren’t they celebrated in movies the way they used to be?Fortunately, a film comes out tomorrow that illustrates the point. Now, you might have thought that if I had written a 2,500-word article on A Star Is Born last week for this paper I might have got that film out of my system. Well, you, my friend, have underestimated just how much I overthink popular culture. Now who’s looking like the foolish one?While the new A Star Is Born sticks very closely to the 1954 and 1976 versions of this movie, it differs in one huge and telling way: whereas in the earlier films the female character becomes more successful than the man because she is more talented, in the new version it is just because she becomes a creative sell-out. Instead of making Ally (Lady Gaga) a better singer-songwriter than Jack (Bradley Cooper), the movie has her jettison her songwriting skill in order to become a pop star who sings garbage pop songs, dyes her hair silly colours and puts up with cheesy people around her. Thus, Jack remains An Artist while Ally is just a plastic product.It is a fascinating twist, partly because Cooper directed the movie and this is a definite change to the franchise that flatters his character. It is also interesting to do this to the movie now, in an era when female pop stars are such a dominant force: Beyoncé, Taylor, Rihanna, Ariana and – oh yeah! – Lady Gaga. The whole thing feels like a reassuring pat on the shoulder to all the male artists left in their dust, and it’s very weird to see Gaga play a character who feels too close for comfort. But this also feels like the natural conclusion to the direction Hollywood movies have been going in for the past few decades. Once female ambition was normal – sexy, even. Most obviously, in 1940’s His Girl Friday, Hildy’s (Rosalind Russell) professionalism is what Walter (Cary Grant) loves about her and, even when they marry at the end, it’s obvious they are going to work on their honeymoon, and he is delighted by it. In Working Girl, female ambition is sexy, in the form of Griffith – as long as she doesn’t become more successful than the man,\u0026nbspa problem embodied by Weaver.Which brings us to the 21st century and all you need to do to see how bad things have got is to compare Kay Thompson’s character in 1957’s Funny Face with Meryl Streep’s in 2006’s The Devil Wears Prada: they are both fashion magazine editors, but Streep’s professionalism is mocked whereas Thompson’s is admired. (And, of course, in true 21st-century romcom style, the conclusion of the latter film is that the young female character should give up her excellent job and try to get her boyfriend back. Yay women!)The question isn’t what ambitious women should wear in movies but when will ambitious women learn their lesson and give up their jobs for their men? Ally doesn’t in the latest A Star Is Born and, well, we all know how that turns out. A salutary tale to learn from, ladies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60104f6dba27c16988f27614287fff40278d7b21/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1419f9889e47876641ffb75c07a657d6","title":"eat more pollock and less squid conservation charity urges","story":"MCS’s Good Fish Guide also says unclear labelling on seafood products means shoppers should ask if their choice is sustainableConsumers are being urged by a UK marine conservation charity to eat more pollock and less squid in a fresh attempt to alleviate pressure on threatened stocks.Warning of a lack of clear labelling on packaging as well as menus, it also advises shoppers to ask their fishmonger, supermarket fish counter or restaurant whether their choice is sustainable.The MCS wants the public, chefs, retailers and fish buyers to refer to the Good Fish Guide to ensure they have the most up-to-date sustainable seafood advice.Native oysters (sail and oar)European hake (gill or fixed)Haddock (from Rockall or MSC-certified)Seabass (caught at sea)Dover Sole (from the Irish sea and pulse trawled)Plaice (from south-west Ireland and caught using pulse trawls)Squid (common or European squid caught in the English Channel with fishing gear other than jigs)“Choosing sustainable seafood is a complex issue not helped by a lack of clear labelling on most seafood products,” said Bernadette Clarke, programme manager of the Good Fish Guide. “That lack of information means consumers need all the help they can get. Using the Good Fish Guide will point people in the right direction and start the sustainability conversation with the fishmonger or restaurant. If consumers can start asking ‘Is that sustainable?’, seafood suppliers will need to have an answer.”Squid, a popular fixture on many restaurant menus and widely available on seafood counters and in supermarket freezer sections, is described as a “mixed bag” when it comes to consumer choice. The species is flourishing in the UK as the waters around the shores grow warmer.While squid caught using jigs (a type of hook and line that is very selective compared with trawling) – from the Channel and Scotland is rated a 3, meaning it is OK, elsewhere squid has the worst rating, a 5– which means consumers are advised to avoid it.Haddock remains a fish and chip shop staple and the newly rated Rockall fishery has been rated 1, making it a guilt-free “best choice”. Haddock from the North Sea and west of Scotland has improved from 3 to 2, meaning it can again be considered a “good choice” after fishing pressure has continued to reduce and stocks have increased.Meanwhile, consumers who fear that a fish burger may be nothing more than the scrapings off the factory floor may be reassured. Alaskan pollock, which is used in the McDonald’s Filet-O-Fish, is also rated a 1.Dover sole, often regarded as an upmarket fish, is rated 2 when it comes from the western Channel or Cornwall, or is MSC-certified from the North Sea. But if the sole on your plate comes trawled from the Irish Sea, or is electric-pulse-trawled from the North Sea, the MSC urges you to reconsider: it is rated a 5.In March the charity said less popular UK species such as dab, hake, herring and mackerel should be Britons’ fish supper of choice in order to support the UK fishing industry and help the seas. For the first time it suggested a “post-Brexit” UK top 10 including species of fish that are not household names. The organisation says that as the UK prepares to leave the EU and tries to secure a bigger share of the fish market, now could be the time to consider new options."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86383a0c200ac24c4a54285204ee6776601fd00e/0_44_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb64f2fb988b62e70242b79202469b00","title":"chelsea vidi europa league match report","story":"Álvaro Morata puffed out his cheeks and tried to muster a smile. He had provided the game’s decisive moment and his grateful teammates ran to congratulate him after his poacher’s finish. Yet his overriding emotion was clearly relief rather than elation and his struggle to enjoy the moment rather summed up the occasion.This game had threatened to become an ordeal for Chelsea before Morata’s late winner allowed them to maintain control of their Europa League group with a slender win over Vidi. They even turned to Eden Hazard in the second half before Morata scored his first goal since August. Even then, however, Maurizio Sarri’s side almost threw away their lead when Istvan Kovacs forced Kepa Arrizabalaga to make a fine late save.This was the first time Stamford Bridge had witnessed a game in this competition since 2013 and perhaps it was inevitable that Chelsea found it difficult to impress against opponents who were content to sit deep, put numbers behind the ball and play on the counterattack.Sarri, who could be seen chatting with David Luiz on the touchline 20 minutes before kick-off, made eight changes after last weekend’s intense draw with Liverpool and that resulted in the hosts playing like strangers during the first half, to the extent that they might even have trailed at the interval.Chelsea were certainly relieved that Miroslav Zelinka, the Czech referee, chose not to penalise Gary Cahill when he appeared to bring Boban Nikolov down on the edge of the area. The Vidi striker had run clear of his markers and the away bench leapt up to protest as Cahill went to ground in an attempt to win the ball. They could not believe it when their appeals for a free-kick and a possible red card for the Chelsea defender fell on deaf ears.In fairness, Chelsea also had a reason to feel aggrieved at the end of the opening period. Ruben Loftus-Cheek looked determined to impress on his first start of the season and the England midfielder raised the temperature with a lightning burst into the area shortly before half-time. Paulo Vinicius had a hold on Loftus-Cheek’s shirt and the Vidi centre-back was fortunate not to concede a penalty.By then, however, sloppiness had started to infect Chelsea’s play. Vidi had offered little for long spells but the Hungarian champions went close to snatching a shock lead when indecision between Kepa Arrizabalaga and Andreas Christensen almost allowed Loic Nego to prod home a loose ball. Nego would also threaten after dribbling inside from the right, only to scuff a shot straight at Kepa.However, that miss was not as bad as Morata’s in the 16th minute. Pedro, causing problems with his direct running on the right, carved Vidi open with a deft pass that left Morata with only Tomas Tujvel, the away goalkeeper, to beat. Yet Morata’s difficulties in front of goal were encapsulated by the way he fluffed his lines. The Spaniard appeared to have a sizeable target to hit and some members of the crowd were even celebrating as the ball left the striker’s foot. Yet those cheers turned to jeers as the ball sailed wide. Sarri could not believe it.Chelsea had not anticipated the evening turning into such a grind. They had dominated the early stages, pinning Vidi pack with sharp passing and slick movement, and there were moments when a breakthrough felt inevitable. Cesc Fàbregas was pulling the strings in the deep-lying role normally occupied by Jorginho, and Emerson Palmieri and Davide Zappacosta, Chelsea’s full-backs, did not have to spend much time in their own half. Emerson, dashing inside from the left, was disappointed to aim too high after a weaving run in the eighth minute, and Willian, twisting and turning to shake off his markers, had the ball whipped off his toes just when he seemed poised to fire past Tujvel.Yet Chelsea’s momentum faded after Morata’s miss and they were indebted to Kepa’s quick reflexes when Nego threatened with a fierce drive at the start of the second half. Having crept into the contest, Vidi were starting to believe that an upset was possible.Marko Nikilic’s players were competing well and they could take it as a compliment when Sarri introduced Hazard in the 55th minute. For Chelsea, however, this was not part of the plan. The crowd roared as Hazard made his entrance but Sarri was entitled to feel that his squad players ought to have been talented enough to cope.Even more worryingly for Sarri, Hazard’s arrival did not lead to an improvement at first. Vidi continued to threaten on the break and Loftus-Cheek’s influence had waned by the time he made way for Ross Barkley.Yet Chelsea would finally break through the 70th minute. Fàbregas chipped a pass into the area, Willian flicked a header into the six-yard box and Morata, who had just been booked for dissent, darted to the near post to smash the bouncing ball past Tujvel.

This week the Las Vegas police force announced they would be returning to the case after Mayorga went public with her claims in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel.The club’s account tweeted: “Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus. The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.”Meanwhile, US sportswear firm Nike, with whom the player has a $1 billion lifetime endorsement deal, said, in an email to the Associated Press: “We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.”Ronaldo, who captained Portugal to victory in the 2016 European Championship, was left out of the national side’s 23-man squad by Fernando Santos on Thursday for the Nations League fixture against Poland on 11 October and a friendly against Scotland three days later.The 33-year-old was also missing from the last Portugal squad, with Santos citing the player’s summer move to the Italian champions as the reason. Ronaldo played for Juventus in Serie A on Saturday but missed the midweek Champions League fixture against Young Boys after being sent off in the previous fixture against Valencia.He added on the national team’s Twitter feed: “In the future, nothing prevents Cristiano from giving his contribution to the national team.”Lawyers for Mayorga have this week sued Ronaldo in a district court in Clark County, Nevada, and on Wednesday gave a press conference in which they said the Portugal forward had 20 days from the filing of the lawsuit to respond.Mayorga was not at the conference and her lawyers claimed the alleged assault had caused her severe mental and emotional damage.“She has decided not to make herself available to the media and stay out of the public because of her emotional state,” attorney Leslie Stovall said. “It is not pleasant for her.”Her lawyers added they were considering whether to release documents they say relate to the case, including police reports, medical records and an out-of-court settlement that apparently included a non-disclosure agreement about the incident.They claimed that a psychiatrist had determined she suffers post-traumatic stress and depression because of the alleged 2009 attack in Las Vegas.Ronaldo issued a vehement denial of the accusations on Twitter. “I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me,” he said. “Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in. Keen as I may be to clear my name, I refuse to feed the media spectacle created by people seeking to promote themselves at my expense."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc9e2c811e9073a1b37a224cb99b089f87ed43b/0_247_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e9162ca18f086123d2cf180c4d28362","title":"glazers manchester united","story":"At Manchester United, the football club’s multilayered travails, the misery of the manager and the palpable sense of soullessness around Old Trafford are all stark reminders of how quickly the world can change. United won the Premier League with a final farewell to Sir Alex Ferguson as recently as 2013, and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan of Abu Dhabi bought their noisy neighbours only 10 years ago. Yet the long modern era, when United’s conveyor-belt successes were further highlighted by City’s repeated mishaps, is already becoming a little hard to recall.One United veteran lamented to me this week that City now not only eclipse United so vividly on the field, in the style and brio with which Pep Guardiola’s winning teams are playing, but in all areas. United, owned and financially exploited by the Glazer family, and run by Ed Woodward, the former banker who orchestrated their debt-loading takeover, are floundering. Yet if they have needed a model for how to do things much better after bungling their challenge, albeit fraught, of replacing Ferguson, they can see it across Manchester.City, of course, is the far-fetched project of a sheikh from an oil-rich country subject to serious human-rights concerns which has its international image to curate when endeavouring to do the right thing in Manchester by the supporters and deprived neighbourhoods around the club’s stadium. But as is now widely acknowledged, whatever their motivation and soft-power gains, and the strange structure of English football which allows such super-fuelled international funding into the people’s clubs, Mansour’s executives have gone about the project intelligently.They appointed consultants at the beginning to assess the takeover and the most considered future-shaping of a successful Premier League football club. They, the chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak and his key advisers recognised that a director of football structure was vital, to administer the multimillion pound operation a playing side is, and try to recruit players in a planned way.They understood that although modern football clubs are branding corporations, for their health they must embrace supporters’ sentimental loyalties. Accepting that a football club is still considered a community centrepiece led them also to accompany the investment with public benefits, the community college and leisure centre built next to the £200m academy, old mills refurbished into good apartments for reasonable (ish) rent in Ancoats, and emphasis on social inclusion projects.The academy itself blasted United’s Carrington operation into inferiority, although United have belatedly upped spending on theirs to £24m a year. The Old Trafford club is finally now looking for a head of recruitment-style appointment, which will be aimed at avoiding the personalised process which blew up in José Mourinho’s resentment at Woodward this summer for refusing to sanction signing another centre-half.City’s supremacy, of course, has been facilitated by the extraordinary £1.3bn Mansour has spent on City since 2008, most of it on paying huge transfer fees and wages for players. But if there is one club besides Roman Abramovich’s Chelsea which cannot validly complain that it has been disadvantaged by this Abu Dhabi investment, it is United. The Glazers’ takeover has in fact drained out of United more than £1bn in interest, costs, fees and idends since 2005, not too far off the amount Mansour has invested into City.United continue to financially serve the Glazers every year. United published their latest accounts last week, with the football world agog at the then-latest episode in the war of the grumps between Mourinho and Paul Pogba, his underperforming stellar player. It showed record income of £590m – still a lot more money than City’s £500m – for the operation of selling strata of sponsorships, which Woodward minted after he moved from the bank JP Morgan to United’s Mayfair office in 2005. The accounts also showed that United’s borrowings remain at £487m from the Glazer takeover, which Woodward was instrumental in structuring with £525m debts loaded on to the club, including £275m high interest “payment in kind” loans.This debt is more than financially manageable now after Ferguson’s successes saw United through the early Glazer years of eye-watering payments, but the 2017-18 finance costs were still £24m. That could have helped pay for one of the players Woodward refused as short-term fixes on cost grounds.Pogba, a World Cup winner for France, hankers after the freedom to play with more elan Mourinho sulks about Pogba, being denied a defender and Woodward not supporting him publicly to assert his managerial authority. These, though, are only the most visible symptoms of a cultural dislocation which radiates from the top in New York and Old Trafford, via the Cayman Islands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c8996dd32ebf6750bd0f6ceb0bfbea979646f5/16_189_3236_1942/master/3236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56e617691819b2a512d5afeb018ce5eb","title":"qarabag arsenal eurupa league match report","story":"Qarabag on a Thursday night might not have been the kind of trip players would be queueing up to take part in. Arsène Wenger was in the habit of leaving his first XI at home for Europa League group games, allowing them to put their feet up before a Premier League assignment, but Unai Emery sees each match – no matter where or against whom – as a stepping stone towards improvement.This latest win was notable for the fact three players – Sokratis Papastathopoulos, Emile Smith Rowe and Mattéo Guendouzi – scored a first goal for Arsenal to savour on the journey home from Azerbaijan.Eight consecutive wins, a steady start in the Europa League, a fraction outside the Premier League top four on goal difference, a new goalkeeper in Bernd Leno who looks full of smart saves, a first senior goal for two teenagers in Baku – what’s not to like about Arsenal’s fresh start under Emery? Well, here is the rub: for all the positives there is still something inescapably incoherent about the way they are playing. They get going in fits and starts, and defensively remain unconvincing enough to routinely give their opponents a bunch of clear chances every match. Qarabag were not short of opportunities.Arsenal may be a bit of a riddle, with problems that need ironing out, as was made plain by the fact Emery started with a back three and then switched to a four as he continued to try to settle on a strategy to make the team more balanced. But during this period of change and getting used to things and having a stab at different combinations, Arsenal have hit on a knack for winning.They enjoyed a comfortable start, taking a fourth-minute lead when Guendouzi floated in a corner for Nacho Monreal to head goalwards. The ball skimmed off Sokratis, who gladly if slightly inadvertently snaffled his first goal in Arsenal colours.There might have been more as Arsenal enjoyed space down the left side, with Alex Iwobi and Smith Rowe linking up well. At the other end the back three were not an instant fix as Qarabag had their share of first‑half chances.Innocent Emeghara appealed for a penalty, gesticulating furiously by tugging at his shirt to suggest some guilt on the part of Rob Holding. Then as the first half developed Qarabag gained the confidence to run at Arsenal with numbers. Mahir Madatov danced into the box to test Leno. The German made an excellent reflex save to beat away Filip Ozobic’s fierce shot before half‑time.Emery reverted to a back four after the break but that did not ease the defensive lapses and Qarabag found the net only for the celebrations to be curtailed by an offside flag.Who could ease the pressure? Step forward a product from the Arsenal academy. The front players seized their opportunity and it was a special moment for Smith Rowe to clip home his first senior goal for his boyhood club.Danny Welbeck won possession and the purposeful Iwobi moved play on expertly, delaying his pass to make it as easy as possible for the 18-year-old to score. Then, with 11 minutes to go, Guendouzi showed clever feet to find the room to shoot across the goalkeeper for his first goal.The choice to bring such a strong substitute’s bench ensured the win, as Qarabag ran out of legs once Mesut Özil, Alexandre Lacazette and Lucas Torreira came on.Now to pick it up again, after a long return journey and a brief recovery, for the Sunday noon kick‑off at Fulham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86383a0c200ac24c4a54285204ee6776601fd00e/0_44_4372_2623/master/4372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb64f2fb988b62e70242b79202469b00","title":"chelsea v vidi europa league live","story":"Álvaro Morata’s goal drought came to an end as Chelsea eked out a narrow victory over the Hungarian championsAnd with that, I’m done. Bye! Oh, and here’s a match report:It was a job done, as they say. It’s important we go out motivated to get the three points. We tried and we tried and we got what I thought we deserved. But they did make it difficult for us. Delighted, job done.I want to play football, like everybody else. I’m no different. The ambition never changes. So I’m delighted to be back out there and to have the armband back on.While you wait for your match report, here’s some bonus Europa League reading for you:Vidi go to thank their fans, and receive a noisy ovation. For all that they were really quite lucky to still be in the game at half-time, this was a fine away performance and on several occasions in the minutes before both half- and full time they very nearly scored.Morata, who has looked happy at no point tonight, even after he scored, strops off the pitch after the final whistle. The idea that he would be suddenly rejuvenated by a single goal has been dispelled by his reaction to it when it came.90+3 mins: Vinicius finally wins it, and Vidi push forward. Could they?90+3 mins: It’s the last minute of stoppage time, and Chelsea are selfishly hogging the ball, passing it all around the pitch.90+1 mins: Morata wins the header, and Chelsea clear.90+1 mins: Into stoppage time, and it will start with a Vidi free kick, just to the right of the area, after Zappacosta fouled Scepovic.90 mins: Emerson leads a good break, and Hazard slides the ball across the area to Barkley, whose shot deflects wide.87 mins: Oooh! Morata takes the ball to the byline and hits it across goal, where nobody gets the tiny touch it would have taken to prod it over the line!85 mins: Now Nego has a pop, but from 35 yards yard he hammers the ball way over the bar.83 mins: Nearly an equaliser! Kovacs runs onto the ball in the area from the right, collects a fine reverse pass, and hits a decent shot with the outside of his right foot towards the far corner. Kepa, though, gets down well to push it out, and Moses clears!82 mins: Two more Vidi substitutions. Hodzic replaces Milanov, and Patkai replaces Hadzic. That concludes the evening’s substitutional activity.80 mins: There has been no opening of the floodgates since the goal, but there has been a significant lessening of intensity.77 mins: Vidi take off Huszti and bring on Istvan Kovacs.77 mins: Hazard crosses, Barkley heads, and the ball hits the crossbar and rebounds to safety!76 mins: Emerson wins a free-kick on the left touchline. A second goal will surely kill this.73 mins: Chelsea’ final substitution sees Willian depart and Moses arrive.72 mins: Nearly another! Hazard dribbles into the area and then surprises Barkley by passing to him, and the Englishman, stretching and falling, shoots into Morata.70 mins: And it’s a lovely finish! Fabregas lifts the ball into the area, Willian flicks it on and Morata, who could hardly miss, volleys it smartly past Tujvel.68 mins: Morata runs into the area but Paulo Vinicius gets in his way. He wants a penalty again, but gets only a corner.67 mins: Barkley spears a shot at goal from just outside the area, which Tujvel saves.66 mins: Morata is caught on the chest inside the penalty area. He holds his lip and complains about it to the referee for so long that he gets booked.66 mins: Loftus-Cheek comes off having not really grasped his opportunity tonight, and Barkley comes on. “Vidi would be ‘I saw’ in Latin, as in Veni Vidi Vici, wouldn’t it?” muses Andrew Benton. “Surely Vici would be a much better name for some would-be giant conquerors.” The problem is that Latin conjugation would ruin everything. If teams are referred to in the third person plural, you’d be left with (according to Google) Venientes, Viderunt, Vici. Which doesn’t really work so well.63 mins: Milanov runs into space on the right, and while three defenders run towards him Nikolov runs free on the left. Milanov spots him, but overhits his chipped pass, and Vidi end up with nothing but a corner.61 mins: Milanov tries a Salah-esque left-footed curler across goal towards the far corner. It flies well high.57 mins: Hadzic is very harshly penalised for handball, after Loftus-Cheek flicked the ball up into him. Free kick, but it was right on the very edgiest edge of the area, so it could have been worse.56 mins: Milanov is booked for touching Willian’s shoulders.56 mins: Fabregas lifts the ball into the area, where Morata and Juhasz run shoulder-to-shoulder towards it and fall over each other. Goal kick.54 mins: Cometh the six-minutes-before-the-hour, cometh the man: Eden Hazard is on, and Pedro goes off.52 mins: When the ball is sent in Morata gets his eyebrows to it, and it hits a defender and bounces wide.51 mins: Loftus-Cheek is taken out by the scarlet-haired Stopira, and Chelsea have a free kick on the right wing.50 mins: Chelsea win a corner, which is headed behind for another corner, which is headed behind for another corner, which is flapped away by the keeper and vaguely cleared.47 mins: Save! And it’s Vidi, and Nego, with the effort! The ball drops to him inside the area and his shot is walloped across goal and was on its way in before Kepa got his hands to it!“Any chance of getting Greaves back for this game?” wonders Tom. If only. A goal is surely coming, though it’s been obviously coming for so long now that it is becoming increasingly possible that in the end it won’t. Good insight here. But what about the novelty ice cream flavours?45+1 mins: After four seconds of stoppage time, the first half is over. 45 mins: Willian’s free-kick is deflected wide, and a madcap first half is on the verge of ending ridiculously goalless.44 mins: Another booking, this for Huszti, who brings down Kovacic.43 mins: And another Vidi chance! Nego gets past Emerson’s poor challenge, cuts nicely onto his left foot and then feathers a weak shot straight at Kepa.41 mins: Nikolov is played into the area, Cahill goes to ground in an attempt to get the ball and fails to do so, and now Vidi want a penalty! Perhaps it should have been a free-kick, with contact taking place just outside the box, but instead Vidi get nothing at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d056ddbdea30e95b211d80e4d7a3d76d84eafa/0_99_3669_2201/master/3669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5614352864140a8dd3f9d25ade900850","title":"qarabag v arsenal europa league live","story":"Teenager Emile Smith-Rowe shone as Arsenal eased to victory in Azerbaijan as three players scored their first senior goals for the clubArsenal have six points after two matches in the Europa League group stages and will travel to Sporting Lisbon next. This was their eighth win in a row in all competitions and there were some clear positives: they were clinical and several iniduals put in fine personal performances, not least 18-year-old Smith-Rowe, as well as Iwobi and Guendouzi. But there were areas of concern, too. They were sloppy at times and defensively they still look fragile, and Emery abandoned his back-three experiment at half-time because it wasn’t working. Still, it was a deserved win and there were more pluses than minuses, with more stringent tests pending.90 min: Another sweeping counter-attack by Arsenal, with Guendouzi and Ozil instrumental. But Welbeck botches the finish.88 min: Papastathapolous plays a superb long pass from just outside his own box over the Qarabag defence and into the path of Laazette. The French rolls it into the path of Welbec, who tries to guide a curling shot into the top corner from 18 yards. But he spoons it over the bar.85 min: Zoubir lets fly from over 20 yards. Leno flings himself to his right and touches it around the post with both hands. 82 min: Medvedev curls in a menacing ball from the right. No one reaches it.A splendid counter-attacking goal! Welbeck started it by winning the ball just outside his own box. Then Lacazette and Ozil got involved before the German fed Guendouzi, who sidestepped one man at the edge of the area and fired a low shot across the goalkeeper and into the net! 77 min: Game management breakdown! Emeghara miscontrols after Arsenal’s defence is sliced open by a pass from Delarge. That’s the severalth time something like that has happened. Arsenal have gotten away with some slackness today.75 min: Arsenal’s remain in game management mode. They’d be happy to just ease their way to full-time. Qarabag are not entirely dispirited but they’re not playing with the verve they had in patches earlier.72 min: Ozil turns down the chance of a shot from 20 yards in order to allow Arsenal to keep knocking the ball around, almost trolling their increasingly frustrated hosts. Good stuff from the visitors.69 min: Emeghara shunts Ozil off the ball and charges towards the Arsenal box. But he’s closed down before he gets there.68 min: This match isn’t yet dead. Arsenal are in charge but there is still a latent threat from Qarabag. They’re creating opening but haven’t yet shown they have the composure to finish them. In other words, Arsenal are winning but still not particularly convincing defensively.Arsenal substitution: Ozil on, Smith-Rowe off - it won’t be the last you hear of him, that’s for sure. 63 min: Super skill by Iwobi on the left, followed by a dangerous cross to the back post. Qarabag clear.62 min: Iwobi breaks up a short corner by Qarabag at the edge of his own box and then runs all the way down to the Qarabag one. But he forgets to stop and runs the ball out of play. Shades of Wile E. Coyote there.61 min: Leno charges quickly off his line to block a shot by Emeghara after a Qarabag corner.60 min: Agolli hangs up an inviting cross from the left. Guendouzi meets it at the edge of Arsenal’s six-yard box and wellies it over his own bar!59 min: Zoubir makes a mug of Lichtsteiner down the left but then fails to deliver a telling pass, running into traffic and wasting the opening. 57 min: Arsenal players who have particularly impressed so far: Smith-Rowe, Iwobi, Guendouzi.56 min: Guendouzi and Elneny orchestrate a bout of possession-play intended for further deflate the visitors. The 18-year-old scores his first goal for Arsenal, to given them breathing space and crown a highly encouraging personal performance so far! Iwobi received the ball near the D and slipped it to Smith-Rowe to his right. The youngster took a touch on the run and then slid it under the advancing goalkeeper from eight yards. Way to puncture Qarabag-s second-half vim!52 min: A lovely pass from central midfield is dropped over the head of Kolasinac in the left-back position. Madatov had darted in on the blindside by miscontrols. 49 min: Arsenal are hustled off the ball in their own half. Emeghara then threads a nice pass through to Madatov, who fires past Leno and into the net. The crowd go wild! Until they see that the linesman’s flag is up for offside. That’s the correct decision. But a serious warning for Arsenal to keep possession better, for starters.48 min: Garayev has a potshot from 25 yards. It’s miles over.47 min: Ozobic fires off the first shot of the second half, a bobbly effort from 25 yards that goes nowhere near the goal. Arsenal substitution: Torreira on, Monreal off. Arsenal have reverted to a back four. Emery has apparently recognised the need to stem the flow of Qarabag attacks down the flanks, especially the left.Arsenal deserve their lead - given to them early and a little luckily by Papasathopolous - but Qarabag have shown enough promise to suggest this game is far from over. Both sides are most dangerous down their left wings, with Iwobi and Kolasinac combing well for Arsenal while Zoubir and Agolli torment Lichtsteiner down the right. Smith-Rowe has been exciting and influential on the ball but isn’t offering much help to the Swiss defensively.44 min: Qarabag goes close again, Medvedev collecting a pass over the top, wrongfooting Kolasinac and then firing into the sidenetting from 10 yards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd39ec7d0813462d8b058c91378cce5630aca42f/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8309cd56d2721803e4bab94b583975f5","title":"faulty batch of 58000 clear simple pregnancy tests recalled","story":"UK consumers urged to check digital tests, some of which have returned false positivesConsumers have been urged to check that they do not have one of a batch of faulty pregnancy tests, amid fears that they could incorrectly show a positive result.The makers of Clear \u0026amp Simple digital pregnancy tests said there had been a “small number” of false positives, all related to a batch of the kits made in July 2017.More than 58,000 affected kits were distributed in the UK, according to the manufacturer, Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which oversees medical devices and drugs in the UK, said that it had been alerted to the problem in early September.The faulty kits all carry the same lot number, DM10220170710E, and have an expiry date of 9 January 2020. They have been available in the UK since last November.The lot number can be found on the end of the box and is also printed on the sachet containing the testing stick.People who have bought one of the affected batch have been advised to return it to the place of purchase and to seek an alternative test.According to advice from the NHS, a positive test result is “almost certainly correct”, while “a negative result is less reliable”.The MHRA urged people to check if they had one of the affected packs. Dr Duncan McPherson, the MHRA’s clinical director of medical devices, said: “If you have any questions about using digital pregnancy tests, please speak to your healthcare professional.”McPherson said that anyone who had problems with the product, or with any other medical device, should report it via the MHRA’s Yellow Card scheme. This allows patients and healthcare professionals to tell the regulator about any issues with a drug or medical product used in the UK.The MHRA said it had received details of the problem on 7 September. A spokesperson said: “When MHRA received the notification from the manufacturer we began our own internal processes to clarify the situation, including working out the magnitude of the issue and potential risks to public health.“At MHRA we need to make sure our response to any report of device faults is proportionate and pragmatic.”Around 15,000 tests had been quarantined or returned by the retailers, the MHRA added.In a statement posted on its website on Thursday the UK distributor of the test, Healthpoint, said affected stocks had been removed from shops and were in its warehouse awaiting destruction.“The majority of users of this lot have received accurate results when using the tests,” it said.“We are very sorry for any inconvenience and upset that this manufacturing fault may have caused, and we are working closely with the manufacturer to ensure the accuracy of future supplies.”In online parenting forums women had shared experiences of getting false positives from the test – in one post, one even speculated that there could be a faulty batch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a491d1e8c50c0a139670e81c3dfba3561d4a9a51/0_9_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5878353ab0f002b701df36f5258e0bbe","title":"why is gay leather scene dying","story":"Not long ago, many clubs catered to enthusiastic leathermen. But predatory property developers, changing attitudes to gender and the rise of rubber threaten the scene’s existenceIn a dimly lit sidestreet in London’s East End there is a black box of a building scrawled with graffiti. A CCTV camera perched above the door signals it probably isn’t a squat, but there is no signage. Inside, past three sets of doors and a changing room cordoned off with an old tarpaulin, is a shadowy warren of alcoves, cages and dark corners. Knee-high leather boots hang from iron chains looped through ceiling hooks like fetish bunting. Men kitted out in chaps and overcoats prowl the corridors, while others sip Foster’s, waiting for a nod and a wink. A gregarious barman greets regulars while hairy-chested musclemen appear on a small screen next to an ice bucket.This is the Backstreet, London’s only remaining gay leather bar. But after a 33-year run serving London’s kinksters, its days might be numbered. “The developers have been sniffing around us for years,” says Aaron the barman. “They want to build another high-rise.” Opposition from Tower Hamlets council and community activists has granted the club a brief reprieve, according to the staff, who all work under the assumption that any day could be the venue’s last.A string of closures has caused concern for those interested in a variety of fetishes, but the leather scene seems to have been hardest hit, particularly in London. Bars such as the Coleherne, the Anvil, Bloc, Substation and, most recently, the Hoist, have all disappeared into the annals of gay history, replaced with gastropubs, luxe apartments and identikit offices. Rising rents, competitor fetishes and competition from online dating apps have all been a turn of the screw. Aficionados fear its decline is another milestone in the gay scene’s slow descent into homogeneity.“If some people want to have their matching knitwear and a cocker iel, then I’m happy for them,” says Nigel Whitfield, director of the Breeches and Leather Uniform Fanclub, “but some of us don’t. For lots of kinky people, we knew we were kinky before we knew we were gay. Losing these spaces is a tragedy.”On today’s gay scene, leather denotes an aesthetic and, sometimes, a set of sexual practices. An entry-level leather fetish might just look like getting your rocks off in a well-cut bomber. But for the more committed, it’s a full look: boots, trousers or chaps, belts, shirts, jackets, overcoats, captain hats, all in premium, black leather. The sex tends towards BDSM, from rough horseplay to sadomasochism.“For me, it’s all about the sensory experience,” says Eder, a 34-year-old leatherman who moved to London from Mexico nine years ago. “It’s the look, the feel, the smell – combine it with sex and it just feels amazing.” He discovered leather five years ago and estimates he has spent “a few thousand pounds” on the gear to date. Leather matters to Eder: he ended a long-term relationship because his ex was “vanilla” – a term for people not into kink or fetish – and has since explored his tastes more extensively on Recon, the world’s largest fetish app for gay men. “It doesn’t define me, but it makes me feel so much more confident,” he says. “It’s not just the sex, there’s a community, a social element that provides you with a sense of belonging.”Eder’s story of stumbling upon leather online, exploring in real life, and discovering some form of community was common to the leathermen I spoke to, but it’s only the latest incarnation of a famed subculture that stretches back to the post-war boom of America’s coastal metropoles.Leather as a gay subculture traces its roots back to the appearance of US biker gangs in the 1940s and 50s. Leathers were practical, but the rugged masculinity of biker culture imbued the material with an allure that spoke to men interested in men. Among gay men, leather was also a rejection of the tropes of effeminacy and passivity that homosexuality had accrued since the mid 19th century, a disavowal of the “sweater queens” – well-to-do, preppy gay men – of the time. “Leather was everything that the self-consciously effeminate homosexuals weren’t. They were some of the first gay men to reclaim masculinity,” says Eric Chaline, author and historian of gay sadomasochism.International travel – at least for the wealthy – helped the US leather scene percolate across the Atlantic, notably to Amsterdam, Berlin and London.In the UK, leather subcultures first seem to have taken root in London in the late 50s, though the history of those years has largely been lost. Networks of wealthy and closeted gay leather fans hosted invitation-only private parties to avoid the glare of the authorities.(Homosexuality for those over the age of 21 was not decriminalised in England and Wales until 1967, and some S\u0026ampM practices remain illegal to this day.) The scene was necessarily limited to the middle classes: hosting orgies isn’t easy when you are crammed into a two-bed terrace with a wife and kids, and leather gear is rarely cheap.From the 70s onwards, fan clubs for leathermen popped up in London, Brighton, Manchester, Birmingham, Bournemouth and elsewhere under the guise of Motor Sport Clubs, disguising the gay fetish as a passion for biking. Around the same time, permanent venues rose to the fore. The Coleherne, a bohemian pub in Earl’s Court, became a lodestar for the leather scene. The horseshoe-shaped bar separated regular punters and a morass of leathermen. At the same time, Tom of Finland sketches of burly men in leathers and denim spread through nascent fetish communities pushing life to imitate art.The gay leather scene had reached its peak. Thousands of leathermen congregated in multiple micro scenes across London, while thousands more revelled at club nights and events further afield.Then came a crisis. In 1981, the New York Times reported a “rare cancer spotted in 40 homosexuals”. In San Francisco, one of the first Aids-related deaths was Tony Tavarossi, founder of the city’s first leather bar. Entire communities were eliminated. Bars closed. Hospitals swelled. The leathermen were some of the first to go.Kellan Farshea, a veteran sadomasochist and campaigner for sexual liberty, recalls the early years of the crisis in the UK. “The Aids crisis was very much based in the leather community because that’s where a lot of the sex clubs were. A lot of the people involved in Earl’s Court were wiped out completely.”But the virus wasn’t the only threat. “Every single leather S\u0026ampM club in London was raided by the police at least once, but they couldn’t get any convictions because juries wouldn’t convict us,” says Farshea. The high-profile conviction of gay sadomasochists arrested in Manchester in 1987, known as the Spanner case, drew lurid headlines and stoked public prejudice. A campaign to appeal the conviction, spearheaded by Farshea and others, went through the high court and House of Lords before being referred to the European high court. The ruling on the case holds to this day and it is still not possible to legally consent to a range of “extreme” S\u0026ampM practices.Decades of stigma, epidemic and state persecution haven’t killed leather, but the feeling that the scene – or at least its physical spaces – is in decline is widespread.“The internet changed everything,” says Farshea. Apps such as Grindr and Recon mean getting off doesn’t necessitate going to a club online hookups don’t come with a £15 cover charge and they are not limited to a venue’s opening hours.But the internet has also fractured, and democratised, fetish. Retailers and club owners were often guided by their particular tastes – leather boots, in the case of the Backstreet’s owner – that dictated what people had to be into in order to get access to the kinds of sex they were chasing. “Leather was the dominant practice and discourse of gay BDSM from the 1950s to the 80s,” says Chaline. If you wanted to get tied up of a Saturday afternoon, chances are you had to do so in leather.According to Farshea, leather’s hegemony in gay BDSM scenes was as much about its commercial saleability as some mysterious gravitation towards processed cow skin. When the full look can cost north of three grand, it’s perhaps not surprising that younger generations are opting for PVC or rubber, a scene that has “exploded” in the past 10 years according to Sandy Pianim, brand director at Recon. “The leather scene hasn’t modernised, it hasn’t evolved,” he says. Many leather nights still exclude women. Lesbian BDSM nights existed separate from the gay men’s scene, but no clubs have lasted. The scene also remains glaringly white, according to Pianim. And in a time when queer cultures are shifting to conversations around gender rather than sex, leather’s celebration of unfettered masculinity feels out of joint, he argues. “Leather is based on this archetype of hyper-masculinity that doesn’t resonate in the way that it once did. Our cultural archetypes have changed.”For all the speculation on the reasons for the leather scene’s decline, however, there is a much more mundane truth. Venues in London that cater to specialist audiences, from leather fetishes to the queer communities more broadly, have been buffeted by spiralling costs, predatory developers and councils turning a quick buck to survive swingeing budget cuts. People in other cities in the UK, where venues were sparse due to the difficulty of maintaining premises catering to a much smaller scene, now rely on one-off nights or travelling to fetish events abroad.For the leathermen who spoke to me, old-school bars can’t be replaced with Grindr-fuelled hookups or occasional events such as Folsom Europe, a continent-wide fetish and leather festival held annually in Berlin. Farshea fears the death of physical venues will make it harder for him to meet with fellow campaigners. Whitfield is concerned that the unique atmosphere of a leather bar will be lost to history. And Eder, who has accrued a “leather family” in his five years on the scene, fears that community bonds are weakened when that community has nowhere to meet.“It’s always been the freaks who have been the canary in the coal mine,” says Whitfield, whether in the fight for basic rights or in the ongoing closures of minority spaces.For now, the Backstreet lives on, throwing specialist parties for rubberists and occasional gigs to keep afloat. For how long, though, nobody quite knows."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/283663e1a2c37e7708519e701625dd4be5d4ae09/0_1_2279_1367/master/2279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad1aadbf01c0643e3f56160a46387ee","title":"chris evans bbc overpaid men zoe ball","story":"Kirsty Wark may be the next David Dimbleby. Zoë Ball is definitely the new Chris Evans. But with the BBC finally giving women a shot at the top jobs, why are its recruiters so terrified of leaks?It’s just over a year since the chunky gender pay gap was revealed at the BBC, an embarrassing spectacle that left staff feeling undervalued and the public wondering whether they could be refunded the £750,000 they had paid for Jeremy Vine, or at least get some store credit. We could get a whole channel of Jed Mercurio characters just saying “Yes, sarge” for that price.The corporation’s response has basically been to say: “Yes, OK, we will fix things but also give us a break. It’s nobody’s fault that almost every high-profile job has been given to a bloke and you’re just going to have to be patient until these overpaid men leave at a time of their choosing.”Now the corporation is finally getting a chance to re-tip things, with some of its biggest stars – David Dimbleby, Chris Evans, Eddie Mair and Radio 1’s hip-hop host Charlie Sloth – having all announced that they are leaving their jobs.Evans gives the BBC the greatest opportunity to redress the balance. He is currently the Beeb’s highest-paid star, although his huge listenership made him virtually impossible to get rid of. Then last month, he shocked fans by announcing he was leaving the BBC to take the breakfast job at Virgin Radio.The original Virgin Radio was launched in the 90s, an era before media ersity awareness when having a radio station play only records by white men in trenchcoats was seen as a sound music policy. In the 90s, Evans twice left the BBC to take up roles at Virgin, the second time launching his new breakfast show as a spoiler on the same day as a young Zoë Ball took over the Radio 1 Breakfast show. Evans, in his boozing 90s peak, then decided to purchase the station, later selling it for £80m before promptly being fired. The station changing its name to Absolute Radio.This new Virgin Radio is an entirely different and rather less chaste operation. It is owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK and is something of a “Let me show you what you’ve been missing, Daddy” project for Rebekah Brooks, after her plans for global media domination were set slightly off-course by that pesky phone hacking scandal. Brooks took responsibility for a suite of radio stations in 2016, but so far listener figures have been low and her hiring strategy could be described as “nightmare sex party”, with shows already given to Julia-Hartley Brewer, Matthew Wright and George Galloway.Clearly star power was needed, and so Brooks managed to woo back Evans. As soon as it was announced he was taking over, the Sun, which up to that point had described Evans as an overpaid “Top Gear flop” and run stories about his marriage – plus, in the past year, photos of him scratching his arse and peeing by the side of the road – suddenly had nothing but nice things to say. Evans and his wife are now “delighted parents”, the only things they are flashing are “beaming smiles”. What a difference a huge new radio contract makes.The question then became who would take over from Evans on the Radio 2 show. Listeners seemed almost universally to want Sara Cox. Evans himself had practically anointed her on air, saying his “money is on Sara”. Some bookies stopped taking bets.But the Sun had different ideas, announcing two weeks ago that it was not Cox’s but Ball’s job if she wanted it. How could the paper possibly have had access to these sensitive negotiations? This week, Evans confirmed the news, although – seemingly aware the announcement was now a damp squib – he pretty much gave the game away an hour before, when a trailer mentioned Ball’s ex-husband Fatboy Slim and Evans commented: “They’re taking over.”It all had a ring of the past about it, as if Radio 2 is really Radio 1 plus 20 years and a stint depping on The One Show. The announcement appeared genial, with Ball joking that she “couldn’t remember” how long she was on Radio 1 because it was the 90s. But if you listened closely you could hear the gritting of teeth, as with a maid of honour giving a speech about a groom she loathes. The pair joked about what date Ball would be starting “January the somethingth” Evans joshed, but both acknowledged they would be keeping their exact timings secret, with Evans no doubt wanting to act as a spoiler, just as he had in the 90s.Cox also used her show to congratulate Ball, although her choice of opening track, Shaggy’s It Wasn’t Me, hinted at a little disappointment.Having had its thunder stolen by the tabloids on that big announcement, the Beeb is trying out a more leak-proof strategy with Question Time, holding secret auditions with potential candidates to replace Dimbleby. Reports claim it will film pilots with each host, including a studio audience and low-ranking politicians, to see who is up to the job. Mishal Husain, Kirsty Wark and Nick Robinson are among the contestants playing what one BBC insider called Question Time Idol – although considering the pressure on the BBC to achieve gender pay balance, Robinson’s pilot must feel more like an episode of Pointless.Wark has long been the favourite to take over, although a pointed comment from an insider that the channel is looking for someone with “general BBC One appeal” seems to cast that into doubt, as if viewers might disappear in a puff of smoke if they see someone too unlike Matt Baker.What of the others? Well, Eddie Mair left Radio 4’s PM for LBC, but Evan Davis has been announced as the replacement, so that’s just a man-for-man swap. Sloth’s announcement was perhaps the biggest shock, considering he has been groomed by Radio 1 for more than a decade. He was handed not only Tim Westwood’s rap show but a new weeknight show in which he became the only DJ on the station who is allowed to swear and talk openly about sex (in a way that normal people do, rather than a “Please call the BBC Action Line if you get an erection” kind of way). Sloth hasn’t announced where he is going, but you imagine it was an offer he couldn’t refuse. There’s no word on his replacement, but if it’s a woman, it is worth watching to see not only if she gets the same pay packet, but whether she is allowed the same freedom to talk about “mudpies” and to play games such as “balls in your mouth”.It has actually worked out well for the bosses that so many men have decided to leave at the same time, but then hasn’t that always been the way? The BBC is like a loving, supportive but slightly unglamorous girlfriend. Blokes always leave once they get famous, thinking they will find something better if they play the field. By the time they realise they have made a huge mistake, she has moved on to someone new."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1370bb0003774c3e34de01fc448cc5e06a93f04/0_2_1960_1176/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=087bba64ca4ad9521c8bd8a2693cd0e2","title":"meet some of the women succeeding in stem","story":"There are women with flourishing science and technology careers, but work is needed to make this the norm rather than the exception. Here, industry leaders explain the importance of breaking through stereotypes and giving support and mentorship to the next generation of female Stem talentBut how do you bust the myth that Stem careers are only for the boys? And how do we nurture the next generation of female Stem talent?“I wish it wasn’t true, but I think gender stereotyping still plays a big part in deterring women from entering Stem,” says Dr Sian Morris, associate director for scientific communications at P\u0026ampG. A veteran of the company, Morris joined P\u0026ampG in 1992, and since then has worked in a plethora of roles, including developing cosmetics that are still on sale today, and working in the consumer understanding team to gain insight into who buys P\u0026ampG products across the globe. It’s been a erse and varied career, and one that has enabled Morris to gain a huge range of professional experiences. But Morris believes that many young girls might be deterred from enjoying a creative and fulfilling career like hers, due to the gendered expectations we instil in young girls. “There’s this idea of ‘pink jobs’ and ‘blue jobs’ that still exists,” she says. “It starts early in life, and if it’s nurtured in the classroom, then girls opt out of Stem.” It’s critical, Morris argues, to challenge the false expectation girls often have that boys are simply better at Stem. “Some girls simply self-deselect. Girls and women are naturally tough on ourselves, and that, combined with having to fight for airtime in a boy-dominated class, or being put down for your interests, can sometimes make you find a different path.”Of course, it’s not all about encouraging women to study Stem subjects at school and university: it’s also about helping them feel supported and nurtured in their career, and particularly helping them to navigate the challenges of having a family and working. Many of the women I speak to cite the importance of female mentors and role models early in their careers as pivotal to their success. “I’m lucky to have an inspirational mentor who provides great support and taught me the importance of making courageous choices, even when they’re unpopular,” explains Ilaria Ambrogio, principal scientist at P\u0026ampG. For senior IT manager Sinead Devine, being a woman in IT felt challenging, especially early on. “When I started, I was in the minority,” she remembers, “and I felt that even more when I had my first child, about four years into my career.” But Devine used that feeling of being one of the few, not the many, to help champion a better work-life balance for working parents at P\u0026ampG, with considerable success. “The number of female IT professionals is more balanced now, and there’s a better network to support women in all phases of their careers.”Some women still feel there’s a lot of unlearning you have to do to rise to the top as a woman in Stem, such as unlearning the social checks we place upon girls in adolescence that they carry throughout their adult lives: aim high, but not too high be successful, but never boast avoid confrontation or handle challenging situations by trying to please people, rather than forging your own path. These gendered norms may impede some women from achieving their full potential in Stem careers – which is why they need to be unlearned.“I’ve grown in confidence in my ability to have true leadership, which isn’t a quality I had when I was at college,” Devine explains. “I’ve learned to hold my own in more challenging situations, and not just to be louder than anyone else, but to be more strategic and really drive decisions.”What advice would these industry leaders give to young women looking to get into Stem? “Be receptive to new possibilities and break through stereotypes,” urges Ursula Heng of P\u0026ampG’s beauty delivery engineering ision. “If you’re encountering prejudice, educate others, but above all – find your voice.” Also, stay true to yourself. “Women are still a minority in Stem,” Heng acknowledges, “but that doesn’t mean you have to be someone else in order to thrive. P\u0026ampG is a great company to work for, because it genuinely values ersity, and that enables everyone to bring their true self to work.”Even though there are as many Stem careers as there are elements in the periodic table, many girls may continue to view the industry in terms of narrow stereotypes. “There’s this idea that a career in Stem means you’re either a white coat-wearing laboratory scientist, an engineer in overalls and a hard hat, or a slightly eccentric academic professor,” Heng says. “But there are many instances of engineers and scientists working in completely different environments on a range of applications that affect every aspect of our lives: digitisation, weather patterns, or transport systems. They are very important, fabulous, and extremely relevant!” Thankfully, things are changing. One recent study found that more women have entered Stem in the past 40 years than any other field. But further work needs to be done to help encourage these women to stay in the industry, grow, and support and nurture the next generation of female talent. Still, when reflecting on the next generation of young, female students, Morris feels ebullient.“They are enthusiastic, energetic, curious, fun, and eager to translate their passion for science and engineering into careers,” she says. “Now we just need to make sure that when girls do have that spark of interest in Stem, we foster it and fan it into a flame and keep it burning bright.”Many companies support programmes that see Stem ambassadors visit schools to help highlight the opportunities available and encourage young girls and children to explore a Stem career.

Here, LGBTQ+ employees detail their experiences and explain what can be done to improve inclusivityFor many, “coming out” is a slight misnomer. The phrase implies one definitive act – you’re in the closet, and then you leave it – whereas the reality can often be more nuanced. Coming out as gay, lesbian, bi or trans isn’t a one-off event: it’s something that can happen dozens of times. Perhaps you first come out to a friend, then a parent, and then your wider circle, before finally plucking up the courage to tell your gran (who says she’s always known, before carrying on with her Sudoku – if you’re lucky).Coming out at work can be an even more protracted process. The average person changes jobs 10 to 15 times in a working lifetime, and that’s without factoring in an ever-changing carousel of colleagues and clients. It’s probably unnecessary to announce your gender identity and sexuality to every contractor, freelancer and intern you encounter, but at some point the subject is bound to come up. Since most people are assumed to be cisgender (those whose gender identity matches the sex that they were assigned at birth) and heterosexual, how does it feel to tell your workmates otherwise?Vijay Sitlani, 43, is the finance director of P\u0026ampG. Born in India he worked for the corporation in India and Singapore, where he felt it was very difficult for him to come out. When he moved to Geneva, his attitude became more relaxed within a more inclusive environment. By the time he transferred to the UK business in 2016, he felt comfortable coming out as gay to his entire team and started helping other LGBTQ+ employees find their courage. “You don’t just come out one day and then you’re out, it happens in small, baby steps,” he says. “When I worked in Singapore, there were only a handful of colleagues who knew that I was gay, and that was mostly for logistical reasons such as arranging visas for my partner. At P\u0026ampG, when someone from management introduced themselves to a team, they’d usually show a slide with a picture of themselves with their wife and children. My slides would always be about my career history and nothing else.“Then, when I came to the UK, I was aware that it was more liberal than the other countries I had worked in. It took great guts, but when it was time to introduce myself to my new team, I put up a slide that included a photograph of my partner, my dog and me. Nobody batted an eyelid, which felt like a big milestone for me.”Others have had less positive experiences. “When I first started working, I used to dread answering questions about my personal life,” says Ruth Holland, a 31-year-old producer and director. “The responses were always so predictable. People would say: ‘Oh, really, I had no idea you were a lesbian!’ I’d think: ‘Why would you have?’ Once a male colleague asked if I had a boyfriend, and when I told him I had a girlfriend, he said: ‘You’re not a lesbian, you’ve got long hair!’ I don’t think he was being malicious, but you could have heard a penny drop, and I’d have appreciated someone taking the heat off me and telling him he was being ridiculous. Other people would ask really personal questions, such as ‘How did you come out?’ or ‘How are you going to have a baby?’ They aren’t conversations that you necessarily want to have in big groups, or with people you’ve just met.”Shon Faye, 30, is a Bristol-based writer, artist and standup comedian, but originally trained as a solicitor. “After coming out as trans, I applied for a job as a solicitor paralegal, which I found quite difficult,” she says. “It was quite early in my transition, so I didn’t look particularly feminine, and I felt quite anxious to turn up to a job interview where they’d be expecting a cisgender woman. In the end I decided to mention the fact that I was trans on my cover letter, and once I got the job I was asked whether I wanted my team to be told.“Everyone was perfectly nice about it, but there were a few awkward moments where well-meaning colleagues got their pronouns wrong, and said things such as: ‘My uncle became my aunt and we all respect him.’” Despite law being regarded as a stereotypically conservative industry, Faye says: “I’ve actually had to deal with more transphobia since working in the media. For instance, a television producer asked me lots of intrusive questions about what hormones I was on. I think it’s because lawyers are petrified of being sued, which is quite healthy in a way. The media has a more informal atmosphere, which can lead to more problems.”Thankfully, things do appear to be improving. “Workplace cultures have changed a lot, even in the past 10 years,” says Holland. “There’s a lot more awareness about what’s appropriate to ask an LGBTQ+ person. It’s one reason I think it’s important to come out at work, because visibility makes a difference. The more commonplace LGBTQ+ people are, the less you feel defined by your sexuality, rather than being good at your job.”Sitlani’s experience of coming out was helped by the fact that P\u0026ampG has a GABLE (gay, ally, bisexual, lesbian and transgender employees) affinity group, which runs training sessions exploring how straight employees can be good LGBTQ+ allies. “P\u0026ampG are making a lot of headway in inclusivity culture,” he explains. “People wear a rainbow badge, or have stickers on their laptop, to openly show they are allies.”As for the advice he’d give anyone thinking about coming out at work? “There is no best way to come out,” says Sitlani. “It’s entirely up to the inidual and how they feel about it. Everyone is on their own journey and you have to do what makes you comfortable.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209eb936dcd10ec9d78680a48334453144dffcb8/0_339_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c6652e12d0db6ac50355aefb8003384b","title":"irish pm urges theresa may uk publish brexit border plan","story":"Leo Varadkar says UK must not delay until right before crunch Brexit summit later this monthIreland’s prime minister has urged Theresa May to publish her revised Brexit border plan “as soon as possible” so the UK and EU can seal a Brexit deal in November.Leo Varadkar said the UK must not delay until a few days before a crunch summit on 17-18 October because the EU needed time to “respond to it in a meaningful way” if talks were to advance. “We want there to be decisive progress at the October summit, so that allows us to seal a deal in November,” he said.The Irish leader was speaking to journalists in between a series of meetings with EU leaders in Brussels, as exit talks enter a critical fortnight before the make-or-break October summit.Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, piled pressure on the British government to strike a compromise and criticised the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, for his “unwise and insulting” remarks comparing the EU with the Soviet Union.But in remarks that delighted hard Brexit enthusiasts, Tusk said the EU remained ready to offer the UK a “Canada-plus-plus-plus deal” – a far-reaching trade accord with extra agreements on security and foreign policy.Boris Johnson and other hard Brexit Tories seized on Tusk’s remarks, arguing they showed it was time for May to immediately switch tack and abandon her Chequers proposals for remaining in a customs union for food and goods. “Tusk’s Canada-plus-plus-plus offer shows there is a superb way forward that can solve the Irish border problem and deliver a free-trade-based partnership that works well for both sides of the channel,” Johnson said.Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the European Research Group, said Tusk’s offer was “a good solution for everyone”. The former Brexit secretary David Davis also seized on Tusk’s comments, saying they showed that “No 10’s claim that ‘there is no alternative to Chequers’ is just wrong. We could easily switch strategies to Canada-plus-plus-plus and deliver an outcome that is good for the UK, acceptable to parliament, and negotiable with Brussels.”Some Brexiters overlook that the EU’s version of a so-called Canada deal incorporates a guarantee to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, which would keep Northern Ireland in the EU customs union and single market. “Canada plus-plus-plus” is also a fuzzy concept that has no formal status in EU negotiating documents. Michel Barnier, the bloc’s chief negotiator, mentioned the idea in an interview with the  and other papers last year.“I don’t know what Canada-plus-plus-plus means, it is just a concept at this stage,” Varadkar said, adding that it did not negate the need for a “legally binding backstop” – a guarantee to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland if there is no agreement on the future trading relationship.With talks deadlocked over the backstop, the British government wants a temporary customs arrangement that would keep the whole of the UK in an EU customs union, but with the right to sign trade deals with other countries. Varadkar poured cold water on the UK’s proposals. The EU could not accept a situation, he said, where British companies had access to European markets but were able to outcompete European rivals by lowering labour, product or health and safety standards. “To do free trade you have to do fair trade as well,” Varadkar said in a nod to deep concerns on this issue that have been raised by France, the Netherlands and other member states.The taoiseach sounded a lukewarm note about another British backstop proposal, that the Stormont assembly would have to give consent to new EU regulations. “Those who are now putting a huge emphasis on the new for cross-community consent need to put in mind that cross-community consent was not sought for Brexit,” he said referring to Northern Ireland voting to remain.Varadkar’s day of visits – which included a meeting with Barnier – underscores that talks are intensifying after the lull of the party conference season.“We should get down to business,” said Tusk. In an implicit rebuke to May, who has accused the EU of not showing her respect, he said: “Emotional arguments that stress the issue of dignity sound attractive but they do not facilitate agreement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c16242155cdc12dbf3ba4c92635144dad47e4d9/1827_376_986_591/master/986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c28aea785826b41058907c7c91b43b5","title":"is austerity really over theresa mays promise lacks key details","story":"PM’s announcement doesn’t reflect current Treasury policy as departments still face cutsTheresa May announced an end to austerity in her Conservative party conference speech this week. However, the statement raised questions about how the Tories’ cornerstone economic policy can be unwound.Did Theresa May give a timeframe for ending austerity this week?May’s speech was deliberately vague, but she said that a Whitehall spending review next year would need to be very different to its immediate predecessors.“People need to know that the austerity is over and that their hard work has paid off,” she said without giving a timescale for raising public service and welfare budgets to rates higher than inflation.At first glance May stuck to Philip Hammond’s script. She said there “must be no return to the uncontrolled borrowing of the past” and she would not be “undoing all the progress of the last eight years”.If the Treasury rejects No10’ s relaxation of the debt rule, the economy would need to pick up strongly after Brexit.Still, faster growth, if it brings with it higher paying jobs and bigger tax receipts, would help ease budget constraints and allow for lower borrowing or higher spending.What would need to happen to taxes?The sensible approach would be to increase taxes to pay for much of the rise in public spending. Much of this increase could fall on the better off and could also include cash clawed back from wealthy iniduals squirrelling money overseas.But the Treasury has made it known that the sums needed to ease austerity are so large that only increases in income tax and national insurance on every taxpayer would do the trick.What would need to happen to Brexit?There is much dispute over what kind of Brexit would be best for Britain’s economy. The chancellor told the Tory conference he would keep Whitehall expenses on lockdown until at least after Brexit and would only loosen the purse strings should Brussels agree to a Chequers-style Brexit.Hammond said large corporations would respond to a deal that kept the UK in harmony with the EU on the trade in goods by boosting investment in new equipment, factories and skills.The European Reform Group of Tory MPs says the EU will never agree to a deal on goods and not on services, so Chequers is a dead duck and only a “clean Brexit” will set the economy free to grow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b242f807b375d137840a286ac35fbe2716c9739/0_63_3930_2357/master/3930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58c6b075efca598527d231058b7955ec","title":"scottish labour leader sacks two msps in purge reshuffle","story":"Critics hit out at Richard Leonard’s removal of Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie, as he calls for ‘focus on unity’Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has sacked two of his most experienced shadow cabinet colleagues in a reshuffle described as a “purge” by critics, and which appears to coincide with an ongoing row over the payment of former leader Kezia Dugdale’s legal fees.Anas Sarwar, who lost to Leonard following an ill-tempered leadership contest last autumn, was replaced as health spokesperson, while Jackie Baillie lost her role as economy spokesperson.  understands that Baillie, one of Scottish Labour’s longest serving MSPs, was sacked by phone. Sarwar revealed that he first learned of Leonard’s decision via social media.In a statement, Sarwar said that he was “deeply disappointed” to lose his health portfolio, adding: “It’s a shame that I came to know about this decision through Twitter, while I was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber.”Both Baillie and Sarwar offered their support to Dugdale after the UK Labour party withdrew its funding for her defence in a defamation action brought by Stuart Campbell, who runs the Wings Over Scotland blog, with Baillie calling on fellow MSPs to contribute to a fighting fund for their colleague.Campbell is suing Dugdale for £25,000 after she called one of his tweets “homophobic” in her Daily Record newspaper column, a claim that he denies.The UK party had previously paid for her representation in court but this weekgeneral secretary, Jennie Formby, said she had decided to stop after obtaining legal counsel that Dugdale faced “significant financial liability”. Formby also accused Dugdale of failing to thank the party for its financial support.Following the reshuffle, sources close to Baillie said: “Factionalism has won over competence. It’s disappointing as it would appear that a Labour party that has always been a broad church has now decided that factionalism is more important.”Ian Murray, MP for Edinburgh South and a long-standing Corbyn critic, tweeted: “The purge of good, capable and committed people goes on merely for standing up for what they believe in. I don’t know whether to be angry or sad. I thought Richard was better than this?”Leonard said that he had decided to “refresh” the shadow cabinet in order to “focus on unity and the public, not ourselves and internal battles”.Sarwar’s role will now be filled by leftwinger Monica Lennon, a Corbyn supporter who has distinguished herself as an equalities campaigner since she was first elected in 2016. Leonard will cover the economy brief himself.Neil Findlay, who acted as Corbyn’s leadership campaign manager in Scotland, will take on the key role of Labour chief whip at Holyrood, while the former party deputy Alex Rowley will return to cabinet as local government spokesperson.Rowley resigned from the front bench last year after a former partner accused him of stalking and harassment following the breakdown of their relationship, allegations which he denied. A party investigation was subsequently dropped because the woman did not want Rowley to read the full details of her complaint.Earlier on Thursday, Scottish Labour’s head of communications, Charlie Mann, resigned after less then six months in post, stating that he had “decided the role is not for me”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d667f158ac33d62149e5061c84c5bc2401ee032/0_97_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc5b02b42a07512a880382bfcb5bea0f","title":"suzuka f1 30th japanese grand prix","story":"Few Formula One circuits stir the spirit like the magnificent 3.6-mile tour de force nestling near the seaside of Japan’s Mie prefecture. Fewer still are held in such high regard by drivers that their enthusiasm is positively infectious. The venue for so much drama and a challenge like no other, Suzuka, with its unique figure‑of‑eight design, is one of the jewels in F1’s crown and hosts its 30th Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday.There is an atmosphere here that can be perceived almost from the moment the iconic ferris wheel comes into view. Some of Formula One’s most thrilling encounters have taken place here in the 29 meetings since 1987. Suzuka is where the best are tested and success is held in the highest regard.The circuit combines a requirement for inch-perfect judgment with a reward for pushing to the limit and a fearsome risk for anyone found wanting. This is the sort of challenge drivers relish. From heading down the hill into the right-hander of turn one, the uphill esses swiftly follow, an exercise in threading the needle at high speed. A lap can be made or lost taking the curves.That sequence is only the beginning. Dunlop, the Degners, the Hairpin and Spoon each present their own tests before the glorious sweep through 130R. Stand at the latter and it is impossible not to hold your breath as cars spear across the left-hander at speeds that seem to defy a direction change taking place at all.The track was designed as a test circuit for Honda by the Dutchman John Hugenholtz in 1962. His creation puts every aspect of driver and car under the spotlight and has fittingly gone on to provide the backdrop to some of the grandest of F1 theatre.The title has been decided here 12 times and the sport’s greats have all made their mark. There have been gripping battles between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, Michael Schumacher and Mika Häkkinen. There was Fernando Alonso taking Schumacher through 130R in 2005, a race where Kimi Räikkönen came back from 17th for the win by passing Giancarlo Fisichella on the final lap. Damon Hill showed his mastery in the wet in 1994 and, emotionally, there was the sheer ecstasy of the crowd when Kamui Kobayashi claimed a podium spot at home in 2012.1989 Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna’s increasingly bitter rivalry as McLaren teammates comes to a head as they clash at the chicane. Prost is out but Senna is push-started and wins, only to be excluded post-race for cutting the chicane. Prost takes the title.1990 The two again face off in Japan. Prost takes advantage going down\u0026nbspthe hill into turn one. Senna is ruthless, ploughing into a nonexistent gap that takes both of them\u0026nbspout and ensures the Brazilian takes his second drivers’ title.1994 Damon Hill would win the title at Suzuka in 1996 but he ranks beating Michael Schumacher in wet\u0026nbspconditions so bad the race is held in two parts as his finest achievement. He is exceptional in conquering the regenmeister.2000 Mika Häkkinen and Schumacher vie with one another across the weekend. They yo-yo in qualifying before the Finn takes pole but in the race itself Schumacher leapfrogs him in the stops before taking Ferrari’s first title for 21 years.2005 Wet qualifying mixes up the grid and newly crowned champion Fernando Alonso celebrates by passing Schumacher at 130R. The race is defined however by Kimi Räikkönen’s win from 17th, sealed on the final lap by his bold move on Giancarlo Fisichella at turn one.Hill remembers Suzuka as demanding and terrifying, a circuit that would bite you and thus all the more rewarding. “That was probably the toughest race of my life,” he said of the win in 1994. “It was hugely special, the race where I drove to my highest level ever. It was more satisfying because it was at Suzuka. To beat Michael in those conditions – I think I could hold my head up and say I reached the top.”Sebastian Vettel echoed his words on Thursday. “It’s my favourite track,” he said. “It’s one of the original tracks that haven’t been messed with. The feeling you get in the car is probably the best all season.”The fans bring this heady mix to the boil. Walking the circuit is to be embroiled in a carnival atmosphere of celebratory enthusiasm that F1 would surely love to bottle and export. Three million people applied for tickets for the Prost-Senna rematch in 1990 and the sight of them filing out in almost complete silence after Jules Bianchi’s accident in 2014 was moving and unforgettable. The track has recently signed a contract for three more years. It deserves another 30."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a09f3345456c0f4aa122b75ae1dd79aa9532cb6e/0_0_4256_2832/master/4256.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9f4936fe1c1bdbb5c4d6ef6816c3b30 880w","title":"apple iphone xs review battery life camera design performance","story":"The iPhone XS hasn’t broken mould like the iPhone X, and it has weaker battery life, but its camera, design and performance are class-leadingThe iPhone XS isn’t the only all-screen iPhone on the block this year, but with its balance of large screen and small body, is it still the iPhone to buy?To say that the iPhone XS looks exactly the same as the iPhone X is somewhat of an understatement. Apart from a pair of new antenna lines and asymmetric holes in the bottom, the phone is an identical metal and glass sandwich. Unless you buy the new gold colour.Fortunately that’s not a bad thing this generation, as it maintains everything that made last year’s iPhone X so good. That includes the large screen squeezed into a small body, the luxurious feel and top-notch new design that ditched the home button.The 5.8in OLED screen is one of the best ever fitted to a smartphone and makes watching movies and TV shows on the commute a joy. The speakers are now louder, but there’s still no headphone jack nor a lightning to 3.5mm adapter in the box this time round.Weighing 177g, the iPhone XS is 3g heavier than the phone it replaces, 3g lighter than the Huawei P20 Pro but 14g heavier than the Samsung Galaxy S9. It’s also thinner than most at 7.7mm thick. All of which is to say it’s easy to pocket and handle, with either one or two hands.The iPhone XS has the same internals as its bigger sibling, the XS Max, and unsurprisingly performs exactly the same. With the six-core A12 Bionic the phone is responsive, smooth and likely has more raw power than most will need, until some magical new app comes along to take advantage of it.Game performance is also excellent, while the improved AI processor speeds up AR experiences and other machine-learning systems.Unfortunately, like the iPhone XS Max, the iPhone XS marks a step backwards in terms of battery life for Apple. Where the iPhone X lasted 30 hours between charges, the iPhone XS only just scrapes 24 hours.That means if I take it off the charger at 7am on day one, it’ll only just make it to my alarm at 7am the next day without being plugged in, meaning you will definitely need to fully charge it at least once a day. On heavy days it would be on its knees as I made it to bed.That was while using it as my primary device sending and receiving hundreds of emails, messages and push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.A full-day’s battery is the bare minimum that’s acceptable in 2018, and competitors can last closer to double that.While there are many factors that affect battery life, it’s worth noting that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max were affected to a greater extent by cellular network congestion, such as that experienced on commuter trains and in packed stations, than competitors.Both phones bounced around between Edge, 3G and 4G more often than the iPhone X, Google’s Pixel 2 XL and a OnePlus 6, and even with full 4G signal the iPhones struggled to pull down data and got hotter where the competitors still managed to load sites and emails, albeit slowly.The iPhone XS runs iOS 12 out of the box, which is a refinement of last year’s iOS 11 rather than a massive shakeup. It still has the same problems of status icons being lost because of the notch in the screen, but it has made big improvements with grouped notification handling and now has integrated wellbeing tools so you can keep an eye on your smartphone usage.Apple has also added a prominent banner on the lock screen when you have Do Not Disturb active, which makes it much harder to forget to deactivate it when you wake up.Face ID returns as Apple’s only biometric option on the iPhone XS. It works just as well as it did last year, identifying me without fault, unveiling my notifications and unlocking the phone.It can have problems with certain sunglasses, and it would also be nice to have the option of using my fingerprint to unlock or pay for things.The iPhone XS has the same camera system as fitted to the XS Max – two 12-megapixel cameras on the back, one with a wide-angle lens and the other a 2x telephoto lens.New for this year is better detail capture, particularly when images are viewed at full resolution, and better low light performance. But it is Apple’s improved “Smart HDR” function that is most noticeable, making images with extremes of contrast such as those shot into the sun much more usable.The portrait mode has also been improved, now with the ability to adjust the level of background blur after capture, which is fun.The selfie camera is good, but not quite the best on the market for preserving skin detail. Some have complained that it smooths skin and makes them look orange, but that’s not something I could see in photos.The iPhone XS comes in your choice of black, silver or gold, costing £999 for 64GB of storage, £1,149 for 256GB or £1,349 for 512GB.The 6.1in iPhone XR will be released in October costing £749 for £64GB of storage.The iPhone X set a new bar for what an iPhone could be. It was a massive step forward for Apple and put it ahead of many competitors in smartphone design and function.The iPhone XS maintains the forward-looking design and function, feeling wonderful in the hand, has a noticeably better camera and is still arguably the best phone on the market right now at balancing screen size with usability.But it’s certainly not perfect, with weaker battery life than last year and a still eye-watering price. With the cheaper 6.1in iPhone XR around the corner, it might be worth waiting to see what it’s like before shelling out £999, but the iPhone XS is still great.Cons: no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, glass will break if dropped, very expensive, no fast charger or USB-C cable in the box, no headphones adapter in the box This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The report claims Amazon became aware of the attack during movesby its subsidiary Amazon Web Services (AWS) to purchase streaming video compression firm Elemental Technologies in 2015. Apple had reportedly bought around 7,000 Super Micro servers when its security teams discovered the chips.The report cited 17 unnamed intelligence and company sources as saying that Chinese spies had placed computer chips inside equipment used by around 30 companies, as well as multiple US government agencies, which would give Beijing secret access to internal networks.Amazon, Apple and Super Micro have all denied Bloomberg’s report. Amazon said: “It’s untrue that AWSknew about a supply chain compromise, an issue with malicious chips, or hardware modifications when acquiring Elemental.”AWS said: “As we shared with Bloomberg BusinessWeek multiple times over the last couple months, at no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in SuperMicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems.‎”Apple said: “On this we can be very clear: Apple has never found malicious chips, ‘hardware manipulations’ or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server.”“We remain unaware of any such investigation,” said Super Micro.Super Micro Computer engineers its equipment in San Jose, but, like the majority of electronics firms, it outsources manufacturing, including to contractors in China.The Chinese government has also denied the report. A spokesperson said: “China is a resolute defender of cybersecurity. We hope parties make less gratuitous accusations and suspicions but conduct more constructive talk and collaboration so that we can work together in building a peaceful, safe, open, cooperative and orderly cyberspace.”There have been increased concerns about foreign intelligence agencies infiltrating US and other companies via so-called “supply chain attacks”, particularly from China where multiple global tech firms outsource their manufacturing.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b0f98681acebd3d53ca76a588fe0702375c9d8e/0_128_3232_1939/master/3232.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e34080fbaca0528048a7f86d9c24daa2","title":"brett kavanaugh us senators to begin reading fbi report","story":"Jeff Flake and Susan Collins say investigation appears ‘thorough’ but Democrats criticize inquiry as too narrow in scopeTwo key Republicans whose support for Brett Kavanaugh hinges on an FBI report into allegations of sexual misconduct against him have expressed satisfaction with its scope and findings, boosting the nominee’s chances of being confirmed to the US supreme court.The confidential FBI report about allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted women three decades ago was made available for senators to view on Thursday morning.“It appears to be a very thorough investigation,” said Senator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine.Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican of Arizona whose 11th-hour revolt at a vote last week triggered the supplemental FBI background check into the allegations, said: “We’ve seen no additional corroborating information.”Both senators are seen as critical swing votes for the conservative judge’s nomination to the nation’s highest court. They have not said how they intend to vote at a crucial Senate ballot on his confirmation, which is expected on Friday.The limited FBI investigation was triggered after Dr Christine Blasey Ford testified at a Senate hearing last week, detailing her allegation that Kavanaugh attempted to rape her when the pair were teenagers in high school. Two other women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault and misconduct. Kavanaugh denies the allegations.On Thursday, the Senate judiciary committee chair, Chuck Grassley, said the FBI report “found no hint of misconduct” but Democrats criticised the investigation, implying that it was narrow in scope to protect Donald Trump’s supreme court nominee.“Having received a briefing on all of the documents, I disagree with Senator Grassley’s statement that there was no hint of misconduct,” Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer told reporters. He did not elaborate, citing confidentiality constraints.The committee’s ranking Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, criticized the report as incomplete.“The most notable part of this report is what’s not in it,” Feinstein told reporters. She suggested the FBI may have been constrained by the White House.Sign up for the US morning briefingThe conflicting assessments came as Republicans and the White House were increasingly confident that Kavanaugh would be elevated to the nation’s highest court after a tumultuous week that left serious doubt about his confirmation.On Wednesday night, Senator Mitch McConnell set the stage to move forward with a pair of votes in the polarized chamber. The move sets up a crucial “cloture vote” to end debate on Kavanaugh’s nomination on Friday. Should Republicans get the majority of votes they need, a final vote on his confirmation could take place as early as Saturday.In an angry speech on the Senate floor on Thursday, McConnell said: “We will not be hoodwinked by those who have tried hard to smear this good man, to drag him through the mud.”Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate and a simple majority is needed to advance Kavanaugh’s nomination. A handful of Republican and Democratic senators are undecided on whether to support Kavanaugh and their votes will decide whether he is confirmed.Later on Thursday, North Dakota senator Heidi Heitkamp, one of a handful of Democrats running for re-election in states Trump won easily, said she would not vote to confirm Kavanaugh.“This isn’t a political decision. If this were a political decision for me I certainly would be deciding this the other way,” Heitkamp said in an emotional interview with WDAY News. She is facing a strong Republican challenge, but said: “I can’t get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I’ve had and say yes to Judge Kavanaugh.”Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia is the only remaining Democrat who has yet to publicly announce his decision on Kavanaugh.The limited FBI report was delivered to Capitol Hill at 2.30am on Thursday morning, with a statement from the White House saying it was “fully confident the Senate will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the supreme court”.No copies will be made of the report, as is standard, and senators are not supposed to disclose its contents to the public.Throughout the day, senators took turns viewing the only available copy of the FBI’s most recent findings, which were placed in a secure facility in the basement of the US capitol. In short, cloture is a way of cutting off debate and ending a filibuster on a particular issue before the US Senate – part of a multi-step process that culminates in a final vote on legislation or a nomination.\u0026nbspIn the case of judge Brett Kavanaugh, the Senate Majority leader, Mitch McConnell, must first file for cloture, which will set the stage for a final vote on Kavanaugh\u0027s supreme court nomination.\u0026nbspOnce McConnell files for cloture, the motion must “ripen” meaning that it cannot be voted on until a full legislative day has passed. For example, if he filed for cloture on Wednesday, a cloture vote would not take place before Friday.\u0026nbspThe cloture vote – as opposed to the final vote – is often where the real drama happens. Republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate and could vote to invoke cloture without support from a single Democrat. If only 50 senators agree to end debate, Vice President Mike Pence would be brought in to break the tie. If the motion, fails McConnell could try again or he could opt to pull the nomination.\u0026nbspInvoking cloture for supreme court nominees once required 60 votes but was lowered in 2017 to a simple majority threshold last year during the nomination fight over justice Neil Gorsuch. Sixty votes are still required to approve legislation.\u0026nbspOnce cloture is invoked, debate on the matter is limited to an additional 30 hours. After that, the full senate would proceed to a final vote. Lauren Gambino“I feel more comfortable than I did before,” Republican senator Tim Scott of South Carolina said after viewing the report. He plans to support Kavanaugh.“We have not done as thorough or fulsome a job as we should,” said Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, who used a floor speech to read letters from women who shared why they didn’t report their sexual assaults.White House spokesman Raj Shah said the FBI contacted 10 people and interviewed nine, includingDeborah Ramirez, who says Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a party when both were students at Yale.“The president, the White House are firmly behind Brett Kavanaugh,” he said during an appearance on CNN. “We believe that all the Senate’s questions have been addressed through this supplemental FBI investigation.”On Thursday, Ford’s lawyers also criticized the investigation, calling it a “stain on the process, on the FBI and on our American ideal of justice”. In a four-page letter to the FBI, they said the bureau had declined to interview Ford and witnesses whom they had suggested.The FBI report arrived at the Capitol days after Trump inflamed tensions over Kavanaugh’s nomination by mocking Ford at a Republican rally in Mississippi.The rising tensions over Kavanaugh’s nomination have led to heightened security at the Capitol, with some senators, including Collins, using police escorts to shield them from protesters eager to confront them.Hundreds more anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators descended on the Capitol on Thursday, and more are expected over the weekend.Fresh questions have been raised about Kavanaugh’s temperament and the evidence he gave to the judiciary committee last week. Several high school and college classmates have come forward to challenge his characterisation of his teenage years and his drinking habits.On Thursday, a letter signed by more than 1,000 law professors will be delivered to senators urging them not to confirm Kavanaugh.“We regret that we feel compelled to write to you, our Senators, to provide our views that at the Senate hearings on Sept. 27, Judge Brett Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial temperament that would be disqualifying for any court, and certainly for elevation to the highest court of this land,” they wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cefc74f22d6b77f721b97c49b2c4d66c16f357e5/0_100_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=329df2657339ec46457f366a16dda6df","title":"mike pence china us elections meddling","story":"Vice-president’s allegation echoes similar claim made by Trump last week but has been contradicted by cybersecurity expertsMike Pence has claimed that Russian interference in US elections “pales in comparison” with Chinese meddling, which he said was aimed at ousting Donald Trump.The vice-president’s allegation echoes a similar claim made by the president at the UN last week, but it has been contradicted by cybersecurity experts and the administration has yet to provide any supporting evidence, other than to point to instances of overt lobbying.The administration’s own secretary of homeland security, Kirstjen Nielsen, said: “We currently have no indication that a foreign adversary intends to disrupt our election infrastructure.In his remarks on Thursday, Pence alleged a far more focused Chinese assault on US democracy.“China has initiated an unprecedented effort to influence American public opinion, the 2018 elections, and the environment leading into the 2020 presidential election,” Pence said at the Hudson Institute, a Washington thinktank. “To put it bluntly, President Trump’s leadership is working, and China wants a different American president. China is meddling in America’s democracy.“To that end, Beijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups, and propaganda outlets to shift Americans’ perception of Chinese policies,” the vice-president added. “As a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.”Following Pence’s remarks, a senior official from the Department of Homeland Security said there was no contradiction with Nielsen’s earlier statement, adding that she had been speaking exclusively about threats to election infrastructure such as voting machines and voter registration databases.The official said the homeland security secretary had not addressed “malign foreign influence that seeks to sow discord, undermine or advance targeted politicians”.In July, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, said that China, from a counterintelligence perspective, “represents the broadest, most challenging, most significant threat we face as a country”.However, Wray added that China represented “a different kind of threat” from Russia and was focused primarily on economic espionage.Pence’s remarks – and Trump’s original claim at the UN security council that the Chinese “don’t want me or us to win because I am the first president to ever challenge China on trade ” – come at a time when the Trump campaign is under investigation for possible collusion with Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favour. US intelligence officials have warned that Russia is also aiming to interfere in the congressional vote in November.The justice department has so far indicted 25 Russian intelligence officers for election interference. On the same day Pence made his speech, the Dutch authorities revealed evidence that Russian military intelligence had tried to hack into the computer systems of the Organisation for Prevention of Chemical Warfare and the US justice department indicted seven Russian intelligence officers for a “lengthy and wide-ranging conspiracy” to hack into private computers and networks around the world.In his speech, Pence did not offer any new evidence for his allegations against Russia. Like Trump, he pointed to an openly Chinese-sponsored newspaper supplement in Iowa, that argued against the administration’s policy on trade tariffs.The vice-president made an additional allegation, saying that “China is targeting US state and local governments and officials to exploit any isions between federal and local levels on policy”, but did not give details on how local government was being targeted.James Mulvenon, an expert on Chinese military and influence operations and the vice-president of the intelligence ision at Defense Group Inc, said: “There is some discussion … about Chinese campaign finance issues at the local and state and senate level, and I think we’re going to need to dig deeper on that, because I personally have not seen any concrete evidence of the same level of meddling, particularly directed towards the midterms.”Cybersecurity experts said China was more engaged in industrial espionage and intellectual property (IP) theft than in attacks on the electoral system.“We are seeing a massive amount of intrusions by China into organisations all around the US, but mainly aimed at economic targets,” said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder of CrowdStrike Inc, a leading US cybersecurity firm. “It’s quite a lot different from Russia. We personally have not seen hacking of political campaigns and the release of documents. We have not seen a lot of going after political causes.”John McLaughlin, former acting director of the CIA, said that Pence appeared to be echoing what Wray said in July.“But left open is the question of why the president and vice-president have not called out Russia as explicitly and forcefully. Russia’s overall effort may be less impressive but it has certainly been consequential,” McLaughlin said in an email.Paul Pillar, a retired senior CIA analyst, said he would be “surprised” if there was a US intelligence assessment that the Russian threat to elections “pales in comparison” with the Russian threat.“That is not from inside knowledge, but we know so much about Russian efforts. Nothing anywhere like that has come out about the Chinese,” Pillar said. “My guess is this is speechwriter’s hyperbole.”"},{"url":null,"title":"few us politicians working class","story":"Contrary to the ideal of a government of and by the people, new research shows Americans are almost always governed by the very privilegedThis year at least two races for seats in the US House of Representatives will feature high-profile candidates with significant experience in working-class jobs – the manual labor, service industry and clerical jobs that make up over half of the American labor force. In Wisconsin’s first congressional district, the Democratic nominee is a delivery-driver-turned-ironworker named Randy Bryce, nicknamed “Ironstache”, who takes credit for “scaring off” Paul Ryan. In New York’s 14th congressional district, a former bartender and waitress named Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently made headlines for her stunning primary-election upset over incumbent Democrat Joe Crowley.Candidates like Bryce and Ocasio-Cortez – politicians with significant experience in the kinds of jobs most Americans punch in for every day – are genuine anomalies in 2018, and in US politics more generally.I have been researching this issue for the past 10 years, and the results, published in my new book, The Cash Ceiling: Why Only the Rich Run for Office – and What We Can Do About It, are clear. Contrary to the cherished ideal of a government of and by the people, Americans are almost always governed by the very privileged.So why are so few workers running? In a democracy like ours where almost any citizen can stand for elected office, why are the vast majority of candidates drawn from the ranks of white-collar professionals, and usually affluent or wealthy ones at that?First, the bad news: there are no easy answers here.It would be convenient, for instance, if we could sidestep this question entirely by saying that the social class backgrounds of politicians don’t really matter, that politicians always do their best to work for the common good regardless of where they come from (This was Alexander Hamilton’s argument in the Federalist #35).Unfortunately, politics doesn’t usually work like that. Just as working-class people in the general public tend to be more pro-worker (and business owners tend to be more pro-business, farmers tend to be more pro-farm, etc), politicians from different social classes tend to bring different perspectives with them to public office, especially when it comes to economic issues. In confidential surveys of state legislators, leaders from the working class in both parties are 20 to 50 percentage points more likely to support policies such as social welfare programs, regulation of the private sector, government-backed healthcare and efforts to reduce economic inequality. In scorecards that rank how members of Congress vote on economic legislation, those from the working class consistently earn significantly higher marks from pro-worker groups like the AFL-CIO and lower marks from business groups like the Chamber of Commerce.These differences, coupled with the virtual absence of working-class people in our political institutions, ultimately have enormous consequences for public policy. States with fewer legislators from the working class spend billions less on social welfare each year, offer less generous unemployment benefits and tax corporations at lower rates. Towns with fewer working-class people on their city councils devote smaller shares of their budgets to social safety net programs an analysis I conducted in 2013 suggested that cities nationwide would spend approximately $22.5bn more on social assistance programs each year if their councils were made up of the same mix of classes as the people they represent. Unfortunately, we can’t write off white-collar government as politically inconsequential. As the old saying goes, when the working class isn’t at the table, it’s often on the menu.Nonetheless, they seldom run. But researchers and reformers are starting to understand why – and to identify interventions that might give working-class Americans more of a seat at the table in government.In my book, I analyze every available source of systematic data that can shed light on why so few people from working-class backgrounds run for political office, including several original surveys of candidates, party officials and ordinary citizens. Across this wide range of datasets, there appear to be two main obstacles facing workers.First, workers seldom run for public office in the US because of the fundamental personal burdens associated with campaigning – doing so always takes a great deal of time and energy, and working-class Americans are far less likely to have the time and energy to spare. When I surveyed seemingly qualified working-class and white-collar citizens, the biggest gap in their reported concerns about running wasn’t a fear about being able to raise enough money, or a difference in raw political ambition, it was a more fundamental concern about losing out on income and work in order to campaign. As one worker (who herself had run for city council and won) put it, “When you are working 40 hours a week and working 40 hours on the campaign, it’s too much.”White-collar government isn’t caused by voters, or some deficiency on the part of workers or even the soaring costs associated with political campaigns. It is caused by the simple reality that campaigning requires taking time off work and getting help from political elites, and working-class Americans often can’t do either.From a reform standpoint, that is actually good news. Making public office more accessible to a broad cross-section of the economy won’t require significantly changing our laws or electoral institutions. People who work in and around government just need to devote more attention and resources to qualified working-class candidates.A half century ago, women were anomalies in congressional elections, and in American political institutions more generally. Today they aren’t. Ironworkers and restaurant servers don’t have to be either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ca2353d4e73eadd2cf345d5e43aa1c436dc0b99/0_108_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b38784dbadf972ed4f2920669682812","title":"bungling agents leave putin exposed in the global spotlight","story":"Botched missions in Salisbury and The Hague may prompt Russian leader to reassess his targeting of the westSpies do not always want to advertise their victories, preferring John Le Carré’s advice “better to be silent, be blank”. But in the case of the battle between MI6 and the GRU, a decision has been made in Whitehall to highlight and isolate the Russian military intelligence arm, aiming to turn it from a source of Vladimir Putin’s power to an impediment.In part, the double exposure of the GRU – first wandering around Salisbury in search of the doorknob of Sergei Skripal’s home, and then caught in a carpark in the The Hague hacking into the chemical weapons watchdog – has simply been made possible by Russian incompetence.Both missions by the GRU, the most adventurous of the Russian intelligence agencies, were bungled. Its agents not only failed to assassinate Skripal with novichok, but they were also caught in April trying to discover how far OPCW scientists had progressed in detecting the nerve agent.UK officials could have let the second episode lie, privately content to know that Russia had been left to speculate to what degree the work of its agentswas compromised.But part of the Dutch operation started to leak. Dutch and Swiss media reported in September that two Russians were arrested in April in The Hague after trying to hack into the OPCW headquarters. It was also reported that the two agents had been planning to travel on to the OPCW-registered laboratory in Spiez near Berne. Further details emerged, but the extent to which the Russians had been caught red-handed was not disclosed.But once the damning photographic evidence of the GRU agents in Salisbury had been revealed, reducing Moscow to largely incredible explanations, Whitehall took the decision to go on the offensive, and broaden the case against the GRU by revealing the extent to which Russia has been seeking to disrupt western institutions.A British government official explained: “Shock went around the world after the novichok incident in Salisbury. We said we would call them out both to deter and to defend. We are not seeking to escalate, but we will defend ourselves, partly by shining a light and partly by sharing the information we have in a new way”.It was felt that the public in the west had no inkling of the scale of the Russian hacking operation.The Netherlands defence intelligence and security serviceneeded to complete their investigation, and the UK needed the party conference season to conclude.Once these two landmarks were passed, the UK intelligence machine was ready to reveal unprecedented evidence on The Hague arrests. The revelations were made in the context of “a constant and pervasive effort” by Russian front organisations to launch hacking operations against western governments and international institutions.The aim, the foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said, was to illustrate to Putin that the price for this activity is too high. In particular, Hunt believes that if Putin wants to have a role on the international stage, he will have to end Russia’s ongoing defence of the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime.The OPCW was not only targeted by Russia due to its testing of novichok samples. The chemical weapons watchdog has become the centre of a diplomatic battle, as Russia resists British-led efforts to extend the OPCW’s mandate from merely certifying whether chemical weapons have been used to identifying the country or forces responsible for their use.The OPCW, in Russia’s view, has been shifted from a purely scientific body to a political actor capable of attributing responsibility for warcrimes in Syria and elsewhere.Speculation in British government circles suggests the GRU is now internally vulnerable after these errors, and that Putin is not thrilled that the attack on Skripal backfired so badly. The absurd explanations advanced by Russian agents over their visit to Salisbury suggests that the Russian ministry of defence has been left to fend for itself. However, Putin’s dismissal of Skripal as a scumbag hardly suggests a man about to repent.It is a high-risk strategy that in the short term worsens Anglo-Russian relations. But it will also solidify the European and American alliance against Russia. And by strengthening the intelligence bond in the west, it could – possibly – give Putin cause to reflect."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d585b10541f805040722366b62ddb972ba3e8bc7/0_0_770_462/master/770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f28760e46e88136a8a99f068c73eaac8","title":"mexico president amlo wedding cesar yanez","story":"Critics attack leftwing president-elect for attending wedding of ally César Yáñez and Dulce Silva, which made the cover of ¡Hola!Mexico’s president-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador won the election on an agenda of austerity and a promise to slash the pay, perks and privileges of a political class often seen as indifferent to the country’s poor.But the leader known as Amlo has been accused of hypocrisy after the cover of society glossy ¡Hola! splashed on photos from his spokesman’s outsized and opulent wedding – an event which the president attended.Social media errupted with outrage on Thursday as ¡Hola! released a preview cover portrait of César Yáñez – a long-time Amlo ally – and his wife Dulce Silva. Amlo and his wife, Beatriz Gutiérrez Müller, appear less prominently on the cover.Photos from the wedding were shared on social media and revealed a menu including lobster tails and filet mignon, a performance by famed cumbia band Los Ángeles Azules and the presence of more than 500 guests.Much of the criticism focused on Amlo, whose 2006 campaign promised to put “the poor first” and who often attacks his opponents as “fifis” – or snobs.Viridiana Ríos, a political analyst, tweeted: “They’re starting to do what they criticized for years. It’s a demonstration that they want to become the previous political class.”Supporters defended the wedding as a private affair, which was organised without public money.

However, recent large-scale reviews have reported no effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mineral density, falls or fractures. The authors say that clinical guidelines that continue to recommend vitamin D supplementation for bone health should be changed to reflect the best available evidence. The study also found there were no differences in the effects of higher versus lower doses of vitamin D. The authors conclude there is little justification to use vitamin D supplements to maintain or improve musculoskeletal health.But the vitamin can help in the prevention of rare conditions such as rickets and osteomalacia in high risk groups, which can occur due to vitamin D deficiency after a prolonged lack of exposure to sunshine. The authors said since the last major review of evidence in 2014, more than 30 randomised controlled trials on vitamin D and bone health have been published, nearly doubling the evidence base available. Lead author Dr Mark J Bolland of the University of Auckland, New Zealand said their meta-analysis finds that vitamin D does not prevent fractures, falls or improve bone mineral density, whether at high or low dose. “Clinical guidelines should be changed to reflect these findings. On the strength of existing evidence, we believe there is little justification for more trials of vitamin D supplements looking at musculoskeletal outcomes,” he said. In the study, the authors pooled data from 81 randomised controlled trials. There was no clinically meaningful effect of vitamin D supplementation on total fracture, hip fracture, or falls. There was reliable evidence that vitamin D does not reduce total fractures, hip fractures, or falls by 15 per cent,a clinically meaningful threshold. Even when lower thresholds were assessed, there was still reliable evidence that vitamin D does not reduce falls by 7.5 per cent and total fractures by 5 per cent.In secondary analyses looking at bone density, there were small differences for lumbar spine, femoral neck, and for total body, but none of these were clinically relevant.The authors noted that the data was collected differently for falls in different trials, which might affect the study findings. While the authors rated all trials for risk of bias, there were limitations in some of the trials. Additionally, they noted that smaller trials of shorter duration tended to find stronger effects of vitamin D compared to larger trials of longer duration. Study author J Chris Gallagher of Creighton University Medical Centre, said many patients and doctors have been persuaded by various studies and social media “that vitamin D is a cure-all”.“This thinking is reminiscent of the fervour that supported the widespread use of vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E years ago, and all of those vitamin trials later proved to be clinically negative,” said Mr Gallagher.He said future studies may show what the extra-skeletal benefits of vitamin D are.“Within three years, we might have that answer because there are approximately 100,000 participants currently enrolled in randomised, placebo-controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation. I look forward to those studies giving us the last word on vitamin D,”he said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Labour TD Alan Kelly tells Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of correspondenceFear UK will use Brexit to reduce standardsLabour, Greens and Social Democrats launch alternative budgets ahead of Budget 2019Teagasc says its worker was on a \u0026lsquovery low salary\u0026rsquo and he was on call at weekendsEnvironment conference hears Ireland is facing an emergency if it continued to produce waste at current levelsIndependent Alliance expected to drop objections to VAT rise\u0026lsquoNeed for voice of the uplands to be heard\u0026rsquo says national co-ordinator Mary MulveyProtest calls for greater accountability of animal welfare abuses across the StateMary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor \u0026lsquoappalled\u0026rsquo at prevalence of sexual harrassment and assaultAlan Kelly asks if garda\u0026iacute have given CSO personal details of crime victims, criminalsVehicles will use variety of technologies designed to reduce carbon emissionsTotal number of garda\u0026iacute assigned to drug units continues to declineAuthors recommend clinical guidelines on vitamin D supplements should be changedShane Bradley also used scissors during \u0026lsquofrightening and intimidating\u0026rsquo incidentsIMO seeks time limit on talks about new services and working arrangementsHome of the brand only place in world where product carries warning, says CallanVaradkar warns of \u0026lsquoconstraints\u0026rsquo on flagged new Brexit backstop proposals"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3650748.1538599788!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit dublin expects britain to make new backstop proposals","story":"Speaking at the Tory party conference, British PM Theresa May has ruled out the possibility of a second Brexit referendum, saying such an outcome would be a politician\u0027s vote. Video: Conservative Party\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s prime minister Theresa May greets delegates after giving her keynote address on the  final day of the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on Wednesday. Photograph:  Stefan RousseauAFPGetty ImagesThe Government expects the British government to table new proposals on Brexit shortly which could break the logjam in the negotiations ahead of the European Council summit in two weeks.With the British prime minister Theresa May having successfully come through her party conference yesterday, officials and politicians believe that long-awaited British proposals on the border backstop – which guarantees an open border in Ireland – will be made in the coming days.While the EU will await the detail of the British proposals before evaluating whether they match expectations, there is a belief Ms May is preparing to make concessions which will arouse opposition among Brexiteers and in the DUP, according to four senior sources with involvement in the process in Dublin.There have been private signals to the Irish Government in recent weeks, while DUP fears evident at the Conservative Party conference this week have encouraged Dublin to believe that Ms May is planning a significant move on the backstop.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar travels to Brussels on Thursday for a meeting with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, at which the two men are expected to discuss the progress of the negotiations and the prospects for a breakthrough before the forthcoming summit, scheduled to take place in Brussels in a fortnight.On the basis of briefings from Mr Barnier, EU leaders will decide at the summit whether to convene a special summit in mid-November at which a deal could be clinched on a withdrawal agreement. This would avoid the prospect of a no-deal Brexit which would see the UK crash out of the union next March.If a withdrawal agreement – along with an agreed declaration about the future trading relationship – is concluded in the coming weeks, the UK will enter a two-year transition period next March during which its relationship with the EU will remain unchanged.However, the EU has consistently made clear that this can only happen if there is agreement on a legally binding Irish backstop.Irish sources expect that the forthcoming British proposal will abandon the previous British idea of a “time-limited” backstop, which would expire after a set period, in favour of an “event-limited” backstop, which would only expire on agreement between the EU and the UK on a future trading relationship that maintained the current open Border.If sufficiently clear and legally enforceable, this could solve the backstop problem from the Irish point of view, though other aspects of the British proposal, including Britain’s relationship with the EU’s customs union, could still be problematic for the EU.The Irish Government could also object to any suggestion from Ms May that future regulatory ergence between the North and the rest of the UK would have to be approved by the Stormont Assembly, as Dublin believes it would amount to giving the DUP a veto.However, Government sources remain cautious until they see the text of British proposals, though Dublin believes that Ms May’s successful conference will strengthen her hand to make compromises. On Wednesday, in her speech to the conference, she criticised hardline Brexiteers who rejected any compromise with the EU on the withdrawal deal.“The people we serve are not interested in debates about the theory of Brexit – their livelihoods depend on making a success of it in practice. A Brexit that might make Britain stronger 50 years from now is no good to you if it makes your life harder today,” she said.Appealing for unity, and implicitly warning of derailing the Brexit process if her government falls on the issue, she said, “If we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit we risk ending up with no Brexit at all,” Mrs May said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Mr Kelly told the Public Accounts Committee (Pac) that the whistleblower in question had been the most senior valuer within the OPW before he recently retired. He said he had met with the inidual involved who had provided back up documentation in relation to his claims. “There are very serious issues that he has brought forward in this letter,” he said.

The OPW is responsible for the procurement of all Government buildings. Mr Kelly said the committee should meet at a later date with the whistleblower in question either in public or in private session.

PAC chairman Sean Fleming said a copy of the letter will be forwarded to the OPW with some redacted words because of the parliamentary privilege issue.

Photograph: EPA Taoiseach Leo Varadkar poured cold water on reports suggesting Ireland is enthusiastic about new Brexit backstop proposals expected from London in the next few days.Speaking to journalists in Brussels following meetings with European Council President Donald Tusk and the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Varadkar said he had yet to see any specific proposals but warned of “constraints” on the ideas being touted in draft British “hybrid Chequers” plans to resolve the backstop impasse in talks. These are based on accepting an all-UK customs union with the EU to obviate the need for a border between the UK and Northern Ireland.The Taoiseach also made clear that the Government does not see the need for a consent clause in the EU Withdrawal Agreement which would require approval from the Northern Ireland Assembly for regulatory controls between the two islands. Not only was the Assembly not functioning now – “that is the realpolitik” , he said, but “those who are now putting a huge emphasis on the need for cross-community consent need to bear in mind that cross-community consent was not sought for Brexit, and indeed the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted against it.”Mr Varadkar also strongly backed a rebuke by Mr Tusk to British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt over his comparison of the EU to the Soviet Union. “Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting,” Mr Tusk said at their joint press conference. “The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours. “The EU is about freedom and human rights, prosperity and peace, life without fear, it is about democracy and pluralism a continent without internal borders or walls. As the President of the European Council and someone who spent half of my life in the Soviet Bloc, I know what I’m talking about.”“ The British Government has asked for respect from the EU,” Mr Varadkar said, ”and the British Government deserves respect from the EU. But respect has to go both ways.”Urging caution on the UK’s custom union idea he said that “there would be constraints, a lot of countries would take the view that a UK-wide arrangement is really a matter for the future relationship which is about Ireland and Northern Ireland”. “I would feel strongly about this too that any kind of trade arrangement must have a level playing field.”“We couldn’t have a situation whereby UK businesses still had access to European markets but at the same time were able to lower wages, to lower labour standards, lower environmental standards, lower health and safety standards, lower product safety standards . . . In order to have free trade you must have fair trade as well and a level playing field .”Mr Tusk said that the EU “wants a relationship with the UK that is as close and special as possible”. “From the very beginning, the EU offer has been not just a Canada deal, but a Canada+++ deal – much further-reaching on trade, on internal security, and on foreign policy cooperation.”The Canadian agreement with the EU is a straightforward free trade deal which the EU has suggested for months could be tailored to UK needs if it insists on retaining its red lines on membership of the customs union and single market. Such a deal, however, would not remove the need for border controls and so would have to complement a Northern Ireland backstop.Mr Varadkar, whose meetings were part of preparations for the EU summit in a fortnight, said the EU and UK were entering “a critical and decisive stage in these negotiations” and expressed confidence that “there is a good opportunity to clinch a deal over the next couple of weeks”. A special summit would be convened in November but only if “decisive progress” was made in October, he said.Asked about DUP leader Arlene Foster’s “blood red lines” comments, the Taoiseach said that “I’m absolutely conscious of our country’s difficult, unique history, the fact that over 3,000 people lost their lives . . .”.“I’m doing my best as Taoiseach to make sure that we never return to any bloodshed on the island and that means standing by and defending the Good Friday Agreement which brought peace to Britain and Ireland.”Earlier, Mr Varadkar and Mr Tusk called for an acceleration of the Brexit talks as the key summit looms in less than a fortnight. Mr Varadkar said they were entering what will be a critical phase of the negotiations and called on the parties to “get down to business” if they were to get an agreement “by November if at all possible”. His reference to November suggests that the Taoiseach may believe there are opportunities to bridge the gap between the EU and the UK in the next couple of weeks ahead of the October summit – November’s meeting will only be called if there is substantial progress. The Taoiseach again emphasised Ireland’s four key objectives in the talks: the survival of the Common Travel Area with the UK, the retention of a frictionless border on the island, the protection of citizens’ rights in Northern Ireland – he emphasised that Northern Ireland citizens will retain their right to be EU citizens – and ensuring as close a trading relationship with the UK as possible in the long term.With the British prime minister Theresa May having successfully come through her party conference yesterday, officials and politicians believe that long-awaited British proposals on the border backstop – which guarantees an open border in Ireland – will be made in the coming days.There is a growing sense that the gap between the British and Irish governments over the border could be closing, with Mrs May prepared to accept some checks on goods travelling between Britain and Ireland, but away from the border.While the EU will await the detail of the British proposals before evaluating whether they match expectations, there is a belief Ms May is preparing to make concessions which will arouse opposition among Brexiteers and in the DUP, according to four senior sources with involvement in the process in Dublin.The DUP has threatened to pull the plug on Mrs May and vote against any deal that would place a border in the Irish Sea, but sources say all efforts are being concentrated on persuading opponents that these checks would not be in the “Irish Sea”.“A lot of this is about language: if the checks are not being done, for example, in transit, on vessels, this is not the border,” said a Dublin source.The taoiseach can expect a show of support from EU politicians, who have long insisted there will be no Brexit orce deal without agreement on the Irish border.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Yves HermanPoolAPThe Government has boosted Theresa May’s hopes of breaking the impasse in Brexit talks by backing her emerging plan for an all-UK customs union with the EU.Ahead of a crucial EU summit this month, the British prime minister is seeking to resolve a dispute over the “backstop” to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland. One of the proposals she is working on – to take effect if no other solution to the Border issue is found – is for the whole UK to participate in a customs union with the EU.Michel Barnier, chief EU negotiator, has rejected the idea, but officials in Dublin privately argue it could settle the Border question and open the way to a deal.The Irish intervention will help Mrs May in the run-up to the EU summit on October 18th as she attempts a delicate diplomatic docking exercise on Brexit. The prime minister may have more freedom to manoeuvre, now that her ruling Conservative party has concluded its conference.She will offer to meet the EU halfway on the vexed issue of the Irish backstop, agreeing to Brussels’ demands that Northern Ireland stay part of the single market regulatory area of the bloc.But in return she wants the EU to concede to Britain’s demands that under the backstop plan the whole UK – rather than just Northern Ireland – would stay in the customs union for a limited period, until a UKEU trade deal was finalised.The “temporary” extension of the customs union would prevent Northern Ireland being carved off from the rest of the UK into a separate EU customs territory. Some British ministers predict the arrangement might in practice extend well into the next decade.The main attraction of the plan for Leo Varadkar’s Government is that it would remove the need for customs checks on the Border. It would also avert the need for customs checks on Ireland’s €65bn annual trade with Britain.But Brussels is reluctant to give its legally binding agreement to provisions that could keep the UK in a customs union with the bloc after Brexit, since it is concerned this could serve as a back door into the EU’s trade and regulatory regime with none of the obligations of membership.Mr Barnier has also argued that the customs relationship should be settled in the second phase of Brexit talks on Europe’s new trading relationship with the UK.The hardening stance of the DUP, whose support Mrs May needs for her parliamentary majority, is a further source of anxiety in Dublin.Arlene Foster, DUP leader, has insisted she would not accept new regulatory checks in the Irish Sea that would still be required under Mrs May’s new bid to revive the talks. Mrs Foster warned at the Conservative conference that the DUP’s red lines were “blood red”, raising fresh questions over the all-UK customs proposal from the prime minister.But, by keeping the whole UK in a customs union with the EU, Mrs May’s plans would avert any requirement for custom checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, one of the DUP’s prime concerns. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3652197.1538687627!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"t%C3%A1naiste rules out suspending naval service mediterranean role","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney: The Naval Service has ‘taken over 17,000 people from the water’ in the Mediterranean Tánaiste Simon Coveney has ruled out suspending Ireland’s Naval Service involvement in the Mediterranean migrant rescue mission and bringing crews home to deal with staff shortages.Independents4Change TD Clare Daly who claimed “the service is in meltdown”, said that for the first time in its history the service was unable to do its core function of sea fisheries protection.She suggested it was time suspend the State’s participation in Operation Sophia and bring staff home to “protect our sea fisheries and coastal waters”.She was commenting after it emerged that senior Naval personnel were ordered to end the 72 hours notice personnel normally got to provide short-term relief on ships and that personnel would have to be ready for duty without warning.The Dublin Fingal TD said that ships normally crewed by 44 personnel were putting to sea with 34 and she asked if it was time to bring the crew members home from Operation Sophia.Mr Coveney, who is Minister for Foreign Affairs, said that fisheries protection “is not the limit of what we ask Naval Service personnel to do”.He said he was proud of their involvement in Operation Sophia. “They have taken over 17,000 people from the water, many of them children who would not be alive today were it not for the professionalism and intervention of the Naval Service.”He said Ireland’s role had shifted from a bilateral relationship with the Italian coastguard in the Mediterranean to a collective EU effort but “our role in the operation is to participate in a humanitarian search and rescue mission, rather than in an offensive or war-going capacity”.Ms Daly also asked if the Tánaiste had confidence in the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces in light of the crisis within the service.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl said “making a general accusation is one thing but an accusation targeted at an identifiable person outside the House who cannot defend himself of herself is not in order”.Mr Coveney said it was not the first time Ms Daly had targeted iniduals who did not have an opportunity to defend themselves in the House.He said: “I have absolute confidence in the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces whom I know well and with whom I worked while I was Minister for Defence.”There were recruitment and retention issues, in part because of the skill set of personnel who were being targeted by the private sector.The Government is examining the issue in detail and will consider all recommendations."},{"url":null,"title":"art student jessie earl disappeared 38 years ago has mystery","story":"On Wednesday 14 May 1980 Jessie Earl, a 22-year-old student at Eastbourne College of Art and Design, walked into a telephone box on the seafront to call her parents at their home in south London.

nor the witnesses who corroborate her testimony - cannot be called an investigation, Ms Ford\u0027s lawyers said in a statement on Wednesday night. We are profoundly disappointed that after the tremendous sacrifice she made in coming forward, those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth.The Senate is now braced for a crucial initial vote on Friday on Mr Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination, with a showdown roll call over confirmation set to take place as early as Saturday.With Republicans clinging to a razor-thin 51-49 majority and five senators - including three Republicans - still wavering, the conservative jurist’s prospects of Senate confirmation remained murky and highly dependent on the file’s contents, which are supposed to be kept secret.There will be plenty of time for members to review and be briefed on the supplemental material before Friday’s vote, Mr McConnell said to the nearly empty chamber. Please review our commenting policyHarry and Meghan to climb Sydney Harbour bridge during packed Pacific tourHorizon: The Placebo Experiment – Can My Brain Cure My Body? review: the fascinating science behind the chill pill GPs being asked to run cookery classes to help battle Britain\u0026#39s obesity crisisComment: Far from inspiring fear in its enemies, Russia\u0026#39s hapless GRU now looks like a comedy outfit Two children from the same family in Leicestershire die after contracting E.coliGirl with peanut allergy who died following Indian takeaway was \u0026#39unlawfully killed\u0026#39, court hearsRepublicans optimistic over Brett Kavanaugh as they claim FBI probe reveals no corroborating evidence\u0026#39I saw the church moving away like a ship\u0026#39: Indonesian families desperate for news of swept away children Lager-primed laughing stock: how elite Russian hackers got caught red-handed by Dutch surveillanceParents who won\u0026#39t let their son wear a skirt may have to be referred to social services, schools advisedCristiano Ronaldo left out of Portugual squad after rape claimDavid Attenborough says the BBC still needs \u0026#39white men explaining things\u0026#39 to audiencesScottish Labour leader sacks two leading moderate MSPs in \u0026#39chaotic\u0026#39 reshuffleCambridge University to offer poor students year long free course to give them a \u0026#39leg up\u0026#39Comment: Parents who send older siblings to sit their child\u0026#39s 11-plus are breathtakingly perfidiousWoman \u0026#39murdered\u0026#39 boyfriend after finding him partying naked in a hot tubBoris Johnson welcomes Donald Tusk \u0026#39Canada +++\u0026#39 Brexit trade deal offer as \u0026#39superb way forward\u0026#39Brexit aside, these are the top three policy priorities for Conservative delegatesHeadteachers criticised by wildlife charities for closing schools amid spider invasion We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/01/TELEMMGLPICT000171262693_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqeK8ehqBZJSTiVTgumtathbH8AD1LYTdJsoz8pklmEgw.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parents send older siblings sit childs 11 plus breathtakingly","story":"This isn’t just mad.

A further four came from Thailand, two infections were from the Philippines, a similar number originated in Malaysia and single cases were reported from Indonesia, Singapore, St Lucia, the United States and Angola, according to CDC statistics.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityHarry and Meghan to climb Sydney Harbour bridge during packed Pacific tourHorizon: The Placebo Experiment – Can My Brain Cure My Body? review: the fascinating science behind the chill pill GPs being asked to run cookery classes to help battle Britain\u0026#39s obesity crisisComment: Far from inspiring fear in its enemies, Russia\u0026#39s hapless GRU now looks like a comedy outfit Two children from the same family in Leicestershire die after contracting E.coliGirl with peanut allergy who died following Indian takeaway was \u0026#39unlawfully killed\u0026#39, court hearsRepublicans optimistic over Brett Kavanaugh as they claim FBI probe reveals no corroborating evidence\u0026#39I saw the church moving away like a ship\u0026#39: Indonesian families desperate for news of swept away children Lager-primed laughing stock: how elite Russian hackers got caught red-handed by Dutch surveillanceParents who won\u0026#39t let their son wear a skirt may have to be referred to social services, schools advisedCristiano Ronaldo left out of Portugual squad after rape claimDavid Attenborough says the BBC still needs \u0026#39white men explaining things\u0026#39 to audiencesScottish Labour leader sacks two leading moderate MSPs in \u0026#39chaotic\u0026#39 reshuffleCambridge University to offer poor students year long free course to give them a \u0026#39leg up\u0026#39Comment: Parents who send older siblings to sit their child\u0026#39s 11-plus are breathtakingly perfidiousWoman \u0026#39murdered\u0026#39 boyfriend after finding him partying naked in a hot tubBoris Johnson welcomes Donald Tusk \u0026#39Canada +++\u0026#39 Brexit trade deal offer as \u0026#39superb way forward\u0026#39Brexit aside, these are the top three policy priorities for Conservative delegatesHeadteachers criticised by wildlife charities for closing schools amid spider invasion We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/fashion/2017/06/23/TELEMMGLPICT000131280141_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq2ZzU7dgG9xeVF_jhi9sma97-Y0BhI1RoymshluGo58I.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"women shouldnt have choose make up metoo","story":"The idea that females who want to be taken seriously should not watch Love Island - hosted by Caroline Flack - is ludicrous As the PM proves, you can both be clever and love clothes When I left magazines in the late 90s for the cut and thrust of newspapers, I was shocked by the number of women there who considered fashion – and caring how you looked – beneath them.

Dieter Zetsche, outgoing head of the brand, told Paris Motor Show attendees that he had begun negotiations with Nissan regarding potentially using its Sunderland plant to build Mercedes-Benz cars. “Before Brexit there was one project where we were looking at an option of producing cars in Sunderland together,” he said. Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler formed an alliance with Nissan and Renault in 2010. Earlier this year, Nissan announced that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at the Sunderland operation, due to falling demand for diesel vehicles. Mr Zetsche shared no further details about the now-abandoned plan, The Times reported. A number of other carmakers issued warnings at the Paris event, with Toyota stating that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a temporary stoppage in UK production, primarily at its Burnaston plant. Toyota warns no-deal Brexit would stop UK productionAston Martin cuts target share price for stock market listingUK car manufacturing falls again as industry demands Brexit safeguardUK car sales plunged 20 per cent in SeptemberJohan van Zyl, the Japanese company’s Europe president, said it was difficult to predict how long the stoppage period would last. Meanwhile, Maxime Picat, executive vice president for Europe at Vauxhall owner PSA, said leaving the EU with no deal would disrupt production. “We’ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites’ competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future,” he said. “But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures.“If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production.”Several carmakers have called for Brexit negotiators to avoid a no-deal scenario, warning that such a departure would hit production and investment in the market. BMW recently said it would bring a planned shutdown of its Oxford plant forward to begin on the same day the UK leaves the EU, in a bid to minimise the potential disruption a no-deal Brexit would create.Meanwhile, Honda has said that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”.Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, has previously warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

In the year to date, car sales are 7.5 per cent behind where they were this time last year.The SMMT said the decline in September followed an “unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year as the market responded to a raft of upheavals”\u0026nbspmainly changes to diesel policy after new emissions standards were introduced. UK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryUK car sales drop as diesel demand plummets for 14th month in a rowUK car sales expected to drop for two years, warns motor industry bodyMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model lineup, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. These are exceptional circumstances with similar declines seen in other major European markets. “The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum.”Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, said 2018 has been “very challenging for both retailers and manufacturers, with the fuel debate and Brexit anxieties denting consumer confidence, and inflationary pressure on exchange rates hitting profits”. However, he added: “Despite the many economic uncertainties, there is some positive news on the horizon for 2019 too. The plethora of new electric and hybrid vehicles that are on display at this week’s Paris Motor Show are not far from hitting forecourts, giving consumers some great new choices in this emerging fuel type which grew again last month.“What’s more, as more consumers move away from traditional ownership to usership models, the appetite for finance remains exceptionally strong.”However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said consumers were unlikely to begin buying cars in great numbers in the near future. “Finance costs likely will continue to rise gradually, while the recent rise in motor fuel prices might dissuade some first-time buyers. High levels of saving intentions also suggest that buyers will be cautious when considering major purchases. Accordingly, the chance of a substantial revival in car sales over the next six months remains slim,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources. The landscapes and the changing seasons play as much of a part in the story as the main characters.Dark River offers little such consolation. It has some lyrical and delicate moments but the mood is generally overwhelmingly bleak and lugubrious. Incest and abuse don’t leave much space for any comic interludes. This is a powerful film with a grinding intensity about it. Light relief it isn’t but Dark River still has quite an impact.Late on in Argentinean director Lucrecia Martel’s startling, highly original new feature, Zama, a character who has just had both his arms cut off, is advised to “shove your stumps in the sand … if you don’t bleed out, you’ll survive.” It’s a grisly, darkly humorous moment in a film that continually surprises us with both its brutality and its lyricism.The most dispiriting aspect of this otherwise enrapturing Oscar-nominated animated feature is that its storyline still seems so current. The film depicts an Afghan society in which women don’t have a face. It is set during the Taliban rule, which lasted from the mid-1990s until late 2001, but this doesn’t feel like a period piece. Seventeen years after the Taliban were ousted from power in Afghanistan following the US invasion, the plight of women in the country appears hardly to have improved. Spike Lee’s work sometimes risks sensory overload. He fires off so many different ideas and storytelling styles that audiences can become bamboozled by his scattergun approach. BlacKkKlansman is one of his very best films because the digressions are as entertaining as ever but don’t get in the way of the main story.Much of the pleasure in Aardman films has always lain in their gently ironic, Alan Bennett-like humour. They take very exotic characters and subject matter but then deal with them in a matter-of-fact fashion. They make a virtue out of their own relative modesty. Early Man isn’t the flashiest animated feature that you’ll see this year but it is certainly the most likeable. 715 Isle of DogsLike all of Wes Anderson’s work, Isle Of Dogs is very stylised, very offbeat and characterised by its extremely dry and often ironic humour. This Japanese-set stop-motion fable is also gorgeous to look at – packed full of intricate visual detail. It deals with some weighty themes (ethnic cleansing, fascism and corruption) but does so in an idiosyncratic fashion.815 Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, MissouriWriter-director Martin McDonagh has a host of award-winning plays behind him but his movies haven’t always lived up to his stage work. This one certainly does. It shares some of the dark and nihilistic humour found in McDonagh’s previous film, Seven Psychopaths.In an era of wearisome poltergeist movies, haunted house stories and torture porn, A Quiet Place is a refreshingly pared-down and very original affair. Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. From its slow-burning beginning, s develops into an epic melodrama. It’s a wartime story in which, for a change, the men are relegated to supporting roles. It follows in a tradition of French rural family sagas like Jean De Florette or Manon Des Sources.

Director John Krasinski relies on editing, sound effects and off-screen action to crank up the tension. We do see the creatures from time to time, sometimes even in extreme closeup. They are very grotesque, bigger versions of the polyp-like succubus which exploded out of John Hurt’s stomach in Alien. However, the most terrifying moments here come when the humans are waiting for them to appear, desperately hoping that they won’t. Lady Bird is one of the best American coming-of-age films since Barry Levinson’s Diner. Written and directed by Greta Gerwig, it offers an utterly winning mix of humour, poignancy and sharp-eyed social observation. Gerwig approaches her subject matter with the same tenderness and affectionate irony with which the adolescent Lady Bird regards Sacramento. Gerwig also shows Lady Bird’s heroism as the young heroine strives against the odds to become the very best version of herself she can be.If Phantom Thread is indeed Daniel Day-Lewis’s final film as an actor, he is going out on a wondrously bizarre note. This must be the oddest film in his career, one in which he gives a typically commanding but very idiosyncratic performance. Almost everything here is jarring – but generally in a very positive way. It is not so long ago that Paul Schrader seemed to be giving up on cinema. The American writer-director (whose credits include Taxi Driver, American Gigolo and Affliction) had taken to making movies like the sour Hollywood satire The Canyons with Lindsay Lohan and the cartoonishly violent Dog Eat Dog, shot cheaply, aimed at a VOD audience. The former had a montage of closed-down movie theatres. In interviews, Schrader struck a gloomy note about the future of the industry. This is why First Reformed is so refreshing. This is not just Schrader’s best film in a very long while. It is also a re-affirmation of the director’s belief in the medium.Oscar Wilde goes to ruin in Rupert Everett’s debut feature as director. Everett also wrote and stars in the film, giving a grandstanding performance as the Irish writer at the end of his life, after his release from prison, where he has been doing hard labour for “gross indecency”. This is a moving and surprising biopic that squeezes out every last drop of pathos from its subject matter. Black Panther is not only one of the most entertaining recent superhero films but has an intelligence and a political dimension that such inchoate offerings as Suicide Squad and Justice League completely lacked. It is an action movie which touches on Pan-Africanism and which owes as much to Malcolm X as it does to Batman or Captain America. Sicilian Ghost Story is a genre-bending affair that combines elements of teen romance, gothic psycho-drama and political thriller. It is loosely based on a true story of a boy called Giuseppe Di Matteo whose father, an ex-member of the Sicilian Mafia, turned “grass” against his erstwhile associates. The Mafia responded by kidnapping Giuseppe and keeping him in captivity for nearly 800 days. Vice depicts Cheney’s rise through the political ranks to becoming one of America’s best known Vice Presidents in recent history.

Nick Johannsen\u0026nbspexplains how even urgent action may not be enough to\u0026nbspsave this stately beastClick to followThe IndependentThe fungus causes leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the tree\u0027s crownAs a child growing up in East Anglia, two mighty elm trees were anchors in my world.\u0026nbspEven more feral than my own children, wherever we wandered above the Dedham Vale, two gigantic elm trees signalled home. Without warning these beautiful twins were quickly and ruthlessly cut down by Dutch elm disease. Our welcoming elms became giant, gloomy monoliths, quickly felled, logged and stacked.\u0026nbspDutch elm disease was good for the chainsaw and log stove market. Across Britain there ensued the removal of dead and dying elms on a drastic scale, which created a dramatic diminishment of much loved landscapes. In my own East Anglian clay land, the change was appalling, lanes which were once tunnels of cathedral-like elm trees became scrappy hedges field trees felled and not replaced, woods completely altered, the landscapes changed forever. When my father died nearly 40 years later he had not finished burning the logs he cut and stacked even from our tiny farm.And now for ash, perhaps our most graceful tree, the die seems cast. Ash dieback was first recorded in Britain in 2012, although there is speculation that it\u0026nbspwas here years before. Also known as\u0026nbspHymenoscyphus fraxineus, is a fungal pathogen and a most serious disease of ash trees. It\u0026nbspis stealthier than Dutch elm the death of ash trees is slower: there are moments of apparent recovery, but the eventual decline seems irrecoverable. The estimates are that between 95 per cent and 98 per cent of our ash trees are threatened\u0026nbspthis would seem to be borne out by what we are witnessing in some of the ash dominated woodlands in east Kent.The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreSo great is the threat that common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the everyday tree of our streets, hedges and woodlands, is now listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.\u0026nbspAsh dieback was first identified in Europe in Poland, in 1992, where it is believed that it arrived on commercially imported ash from East Asia. In its native Asia, the fungus will have co-evolved with the Asian species of ash, on which it therefore has limited\u0026nbspimpact European ash has far less immunity.\u0026nbspThe fungus lives in the leaf litter and has a delicate if peculiar beauty. Thousands of airborne spores are released and can disperse naturally on the wind over tens of kilometres. Continual cycles of infection and reinfection from the leaf litter below produce trees punch drunk with pathogen.\u0026nbspAsh dieback is well described: the effect of the fungus is to block the water transport systems in trees causing leaf loss, lesions in the wood and on the bark, and ultimately the dieback of the crown of the tree. Young trees succumb quickly in older trees the decline can take between six\u0026nbspto 20 years. When the fight is lost, the weakened tree succumbs or is attacked and ultimately killed by another pest or pathogen. The elegant, luxuriant deep green of a late summer venerable ash is reduced to a threadbare tangle of branches and twigs. Desperate new “epicormic”\u0026nbspgrowth emerging from the trunk and branches changes the form and elegance of the tree, once more diminishing our landscapes.An ash tree is a whole ecology: almost 1,000 species use ash as a habitat, including wood mice, liverworts, wrens, blue tits, bats, lichens, fungi and beetles. Bullfinches will eat ash keys in winter when food is scarce. The caterpillars of many kinds of moth feed on ash leaves.\u0026nbspMany lichens are hosted by ash. Lichens are not a parasite and they do not feed off the tree, but use it as a support. According to Oliver Rackham, author of the brilliant book The Ash Tree, the ash is the last refuge of many declining tree lichens, especially those that once grew on elms before they fell victim to loss of habitat through Dutch elm disease. King Alfred’s Cakes (Daldinia concentrica) are specific to ash, and a number of beetles that live only on this fungus are dependent solely on ash for survival.It is true to say that some ash trees appear to be able to resist or tolerate infection. There is a significant scientific effort going into studying the genetic factors which make this possible so that tolerant ash trees can be bred for the future. Interesting and exciting developments in the science are occurring all of the time and the Living Ash Project reports big steps in collecting, grafting and growing from trees that are identified as being “putatively tolerant to ash dieback”.\u0026nbspDespite the extent of devastation already witnessed elsewhere in Europe and in certain parts of Britain, scientists from the Earlham Institute have found an incredibly limited genetic ersity in the fungus. It would seem that the original infection in European ash may have come from just one or two mushroom-like fruiting bodies.\u0026nbspAccording to the Natural History Museum the ersity of the fungus found across Europe is just an eighth of that found in a single Japanese woodland, so is likely to be a just a tiny fraction of that found across Asia. Imagine what might happen if more of that Asian genetic ersity is brought into Europe.The ash dieback story is bleak, but\u0026nbspfor the beleaguered ash tree\u0026nbspanother\u0026nbspperhaps even more serious\u0026nbspthreat approaches from another invasive species with its own surprising beauty. The Emerald Ash Borer beetle, again a native of Asia, was imported accidentally to North America, thought to have been\u0026nbspon something as apparently innocent as wooden packing material. The impact in North America has been widespread and devastating, killing hundreds of millions of trees since the 1990s.\u0026nbspEmerald Ash Borer has now been found in Russia and is moving westwards and southwards at a rate of around 25 miles a year.The extreme vulnerability of our trees to imported pests and diseases is most dramatically illustrated by the loss of elm and ash. Our trees have such long lives our treescapes take such a long time to recover from these attacks that managing the risk of importing further diseases and pests must be a critical issue for the future.\u0026nbspThere are a wide variety of other tree diseases, which are known threats:\u0026nbspwhile many websites have listings of the top things to do, see or visit, rather sadly the Forestry Commission website has a list of “top tree diseases”.Ash dieback is just one of a list of 14 top diseases, and the borer beetle one of the eight\u0026nbsptop pests.\u0026nbspThe loss of a single beautiful tree can be felt deeply and personally we face the loss of hundreds of millions of trees from Britain’s treescapes, the forces for change are enormous and the response should be in equal measure.Earlier this year the government produced a 25-year plan for the environment, an ambitious initiative that\u0026nbsphas signalled a strong intent to leave the environment in a better state than it was found. The “at a glance”\u0026nbspsummary includes the need to protect our many plants, trees and wildlife species in its very first line. One of the first, most tangible early outputs of the plan is the Tree Health Resilience Strategy. The strategy sets out an integrated approach, which seeks to significantly strengthen biosecurity in\u0026nbspprocurement and practice, deploy the best science and evidence to understand and respond to the risks in an informed way and to increase the extent, connectivity, ersity and condition of our trees and woodlands.The strategy recognises that there is a real need to increase the resistance of our treescapes so that there is no further substantial change or loss, and to support the recovery and adaptation of our landscapes in what will inevitably be a most difficult future.There is a scientific, technical and conservation response to ash dieback and it is vital that there is, but what is the cultural response?\u0026nbspWhat about the little boy who lost his elm trees and is now working to try to conserve and enhance the Kent Downs, one of Britain’s finest and most ash dominated landscapes what is the emotional response?\u0026nbspA fully grown ash can reach a height of 35 metres and can live to 400 years or more. The trees can be easily recognised by their\u0026nbspblack buds and clusters of seeds – which can be a menace for gardeners proud of their lawns. Native to Europe, Africa and Asia, ash is dominant in many parts of the UK and provides the perfect habitat for various wildflowers on the woodland floor, as well as numerous bird species which\u0026nbspnest in its branches. In days gone by the ash was believed to have healing properties – in Viking mythology it was known as the ‘tree of life’.The hills and valleys of this enchanting quarter of Kent are punctuated by ash, our most common tree. Ash is intrinsic to the place, it is in the names of the villages, towns and woodlands one of the most affected woods has two names, Asholt Wood and Ashley Wood a single remarkable ash tree is marked on the Ordnance Survey map for Ashford.\u0026nbspWe expect that we will lose almost all of our ash trees and so we feel that it is vital that we record and celebrate what we have before it might be lost. We want to do this in extraordinary and enduring ways so that we connect more with our trees and treescapes and provide a record for the future. For elm, Gerald Wilkinson wrote Epitaph for The Elm. Hastily put together and almost too late to record fine elm trees in the landscape, it is a saddening record.\u0026nbspOur idea is to salute the tree, as well as mark the loss.\u0026nbspThe Ash Project, which is funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Arts Council of England, combines a major new sculptural commission by internationally recognised artists Ackroyd \u0026amp Harvey with a wide-ranging programme of walks, talks and exhibitions.\u0026nbspWe have created a temporary archive that records both the extraordinary utility of ash and celebrates ordinary ash objects that we all might know.The Ash Archive involves\u0026nbspexisting objects and art works and new commissions across a range of art forms, and the public is invited to add to a growing, collectively generated collection. Our approach has been to collaborate across conservation and scientific research work to develop new languages with this massive environmental change. It is our hope that, through the Ash Project, we will preserve our memories of the tree for the generations who will live with the loss.The cultural celebration is also supported by a collaboration with the Woodland Trust and a number of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, in which ash is dominant, to work with author Archie Miles to publish a monograph. Titled Ash, this new publication pays tribute to the ash tree in all of its glorious manifestations across the landscapes of the UK. The book, on sale now,\u0026nbspis a loving homage to the ash tree.On a practical basis we are working with a wide variety of organisations to support a Kent-wide plan for landscape restoration. We have produced guidance for landowners in order to plan wide scale recovery and to ensure we retain much of the bioersity that ash supports, but surely more must be done across the country to prevent further landscape and environmental loss.Campaign plants trees every time Trump tweets about climate changeHere’s why we’re planting trees in northern SyriaCouncil ‘reliant on police’ to carry out tree-felling workAs the summer wanes the impact of ash dieback is at its greatest. At this time of year in Kent we see the ink-like blackening of the leaves of affected trees, with leaf fall occurring as much as a month or two earlier than it should, bringing the bleakness of winter to the landscape all too soon.It is in this season that we have chosen to present Ash to Ash\u0026nbsp– a monumental art work by Ackroyd\u0026nbsp\u0026amp\u0026nbspHarvey. Standing high on the scarp of the Kent Downs, two giant monoliths stand proud, almost defiant. One the bright white of newly cut ash wood, the other charred and blackened like the inky leaves of an affected tree. These extraordinary pieces, made from ash dieback stricken trees, are pierced by more than 10,000 arrows, handmade from coppiced ash. They act as marker trees, on the edge of the North Downs Way.\u0026nbspOverlooking a landscape already damaged by ash dieback, they will be a striking reminder of all that we stand to lose. Unlike the giant elm monoliths of my childhood, this extraordinary artwork both memorialises and celebrates the ash.\u0026nbspIn Kent and East Anglia the impact of ash dieback is already, in places, devastating.\u0026nbspThis seems likely to be the story across the country over the next 10 to 15 years.Ash is perhaps most closely associated with some of our most valued landscapes, the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty and National Parks. Places such as\u0026nbspthe Cotswolds, Chilterns, High Weald, Lake District, Dorset, Yorkshire Dales, White Peak and Snowdonia are, in part, defined by their relationship with the ash tree, there is a great need to document and celebrate these landscapes also.We plan to take the work\u0026nbspwe have started in Kent to a national platform, to collaborate across Britain with landscape managers, artists, scientists and ecologists to ensure we mark and honour the graceful Venus of the woods, the tree of life, before it is lost to us.Nick\u0026nbspJohannsen\u0026nbspis director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Unit.

By Patrick KingsleyClick to followThe IndependentAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, the number of children receiving at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled in the last yearIt’s half past eight, and the school day is just starting at Morecambe Bay Primary, a state-run\u0026nbspschool in northwest England. Siobhan Collingwood, the headteacher, points\u0026nbspto a cheerful boy munching his way through two slices of toast – his first meal of the day.Teachers, she says, sometimes find him sifting through trash cans for discarded fruit. “He’d eat his way through whatever we put in front of him.”Some students trickle\u0026nbspthrough without stopping they’ve\u0026nbspalready eaten. But a few dozen head\u0026nbspstraight to the food counter. Of 350 students, roughly one in three would not have breakfast unless the school provided it, Collingwood reckons.Brexit wasn’t caused by austerity, and here’s the proofDuring Collingwood’s 13 years as headteacher at Morecambe Bay Primary, there have\u0026nbspalways been a few hungry children. But two years ago, the staff noticed an increasing number of youngsters returning undernourished after spending school breaks at home.Initially, Collingwood and her staff were puzzled.\u0026nbspMany parents held jobs, even if they struggled to cover the bills. Then it dawned on them that the rising number of hungry children at Morecambe Bay coincided with sharp reductions in welfare benefits associated with the clumsy introduction of a new welfare programme.“As we spoke to parents,” Collingwood says, “it became clear that for many of them, it was caused by changes to the benefit system rolled out in recent years, which were forcing families into crisis.”Across Britain, the number of children living in poverty has jumped sharply in the past six years, a trend that critics blame in part on the\u0026nbspgovernment’s policy of austerity, the budget-slashing response to the 2008 financial crisis\u0026nbspsteadily reshaping British life.And there is no immediate relief on the horizon. The County Councils Network, a group of local governing bodies, warned recently of £1bn\u0026nbspin budget cuts nationwide next year, draining more money from social services, including some for children.To be clear, Britain is not Venezuela. Reports of hungry children showing up in Morecambe doctors’ offices with rickets have proved false. But that is cold comfort in one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one that over the years has made a strong commitment to child welfare.While hunger is not the only social pathology associated with childhood poverty, it is perhaps the hardest to conceal. In that respect, it is a flashing signal of a deepening problem.For children, the consequences of poverty can be severe. In the short term, poverty elevates the risk of illness, hunger and social stigma. In the long term, it can create a vicious cycle from which a child struggles to escape, especially in class-conscious Britain.British teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds are roughly a third as likely to achieve good GCSE\u0026nbspgrades, according to government statistics.They are then roughly half as likely to go to university, according to a separate set of government data. Those who do make it are less likely to get a better paid job within six months of graduation than those from more privileged backgrounds. And they are less likely to make it into high status professions, such as finance, law or medicine.Even those who do crack the “class ceiling” earn an average of 16 per cent less than more privileged peers, researchers at the London School of Economics found.The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the pastAnd those from poorer backgrounds are likely to die around five years earlier than those who are not, government data suggests.Before the financial crisis in 2008 and the subsequent budget squeeze, successive British governments, both Conservative and Labour, achieved progress on childhood poverty. The number of minors living in “relative poverty” – families with an annual household income less than 60 per cent of the national median, after housing costs – fell by roughly 800,000\u0026nbspto 3.5 million\u0026nbspbetween 1998 and 2012, or 27 per cent of all Britons aged 16 or younger.But the same year that parliament passed the Welfare Reform Act, a central plank of the austerity programme, the trend began to reverse.\u0026nbspSince 2012, about 600,000 children have fallen back into “relative poverty”. During the same period, the number of children requiring food handouts from the Trussell Trust, the country’s largest network of food banks, more than tripled, to over 484,000 from nearly 127,000.Overall, since returning to power in 2010, the Conservatives have announced more than £30bn\u0026nbspin benefit cuts and abandoned prior targets to substantially reduce child poverty by 2020.By 2021, roughly 35 per cent of all minors in Britain are predicted to be poor, according to forecasts by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. And the country’s pending departure from the European Union may deepen the problem, because of rising living costs and the sudden loss of funding from Brussels for young people, according to a joint assessment by seven leading children’s charities.In November, the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty\u0026nbspPhilip Alston will make an official visit to Britain to research the connection between the austerity programme and the rise in poverty – the first such visit to Britain by a United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty.“It’s increasingly evident, particularly to people working with children, that we’re in a child poverty crisis,” says Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, a British charity. “And it is primarily to do with the massive cuts to benefits.”The Conservative Party leaders who pushed through the austerity programme\u0026nbspdispute that it is the cause of rising child poverty, or that child poverty is increasing. They argue that universal credit – the\u0026nbspnew system that bundles most payments into one –\u0026nbspis an improvement.The new system is “infinitely better than what it replaced”, says Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative former cabinet minister who oversaw the changes. “The process of stepping into work is easier.”That rationale is being questioned. Though unemployment has been more than halved under the Conservatives, the overall child poverty rate has risen. And roughly two-thirds of poor children have at least one parent who works, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says.“We tell ourselves completely the wrong story about poverty in the UK,” Garnham says. “The government likes to focus attention on workless families, but there’s hardly any left. That’s a problem of the past.”Created with Sketch.Greeks slide deeper into poverty Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Retired teacher and volunteer Eva Agkisalaki clears tables at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensPeople eat at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church in AthensThe monthly food supplies that were given out in February by an Athens Municipality-run centre are pictured in AthensAn elderly man sells chestnuts in front of the parliament during a demonstration to demand tax reductions and compensation in AthensPeople make their way outside the main fish market of AthensA butcher waits for clients inside the main meat market of AthensAn elderly woman searches through donated clothes at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox churchChildren\u0027s clothes to be donated to impoverished Greeks are arranged in a stock room at an Athens Municipality-run centre A man waits to have his clothes washed by the Ithaca mobile laundry service for the homeless in central Athens, GreecePeople line up to apply for a social benefit from the Directorate of Social Welfare and Health of the Municipality of AthensFood is laid out on a table at a soup kitchen run by the Orthodox church Poverty stricken area of Perama Working, but poorJust outside Morecambe, a tourist town that no longer draws so many tourists, George McCullough, a single parent to a six-year-old son, is\u0026nbspin financial meltdown. His rent has\u0026nbspfallen into arrears, and he can\u0026nbspno longer pay the family’s utility bills. He’s started\u0026nbspto dip into his overdraft, incurring further bank charges.He’s\u0026nbspstopped socialising and sometimes skips\u0026nbspmeals to ensure that his son eats\u0026nbspthree times a day. But he can\u0026nbspno longer afford to give the boy a balanced diet or a new school uniform, or take him to see friends.“He basically can’t go to any of his mates’ parties or houses,” McCullough says. “I literally can’t afford to pay for a gift, or even to take him there.”What\u0026nbspthrew\u0026nbsphis affairs into crisis was the transition to universal credit. Before the welfare changes, McCullough received around £685\u0026nbspevery month to supplement the roughly £500\u0026nbspa month he earns as a bus driver for disabled children.It’s\u0026nbspnot just that he now receives\u0026nbsproughly £40\u0026nbspless a month, though for a family that was already struggling to stay above the poverty line, the cut – the cost of a week’s groceries – was painful. (Others have experienced worse: the average working family has lost more than £75\u0026nbspa month, according to calculations by the Child Poverty Action Group.)What has really hurt McCullough\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphow that loss is\u0026nbspcompounded, severely, by the problematic rollout of universal credit in 2016.Under the new system, all claimants have to wait at least five weeks for their first payment –\u0026nbspa dangerously long delay for families living hand-to-mouth. In McCullough’s case, the delay was long enough to throw him into a vicious cycle of debt.By this May, the family had almost climbed from the hole when they were hit by a second quirk of the universal credit system. After his employers paid him early, giving him two payments in one month, officials wrongly concluded that his salary had doubled and cut his benefits. For several weeks, they refused to admit their mistake, plunging him back into debt.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre“If this is going to be a regular occurrence,” McCullough asked, “where is the incentive to work?”McCullough’s experiences are not unique. The government’s own research into the system found that nearly half of claimants needed help to fill out the application form, while four in 10 were still facing financial difficulties eight months into their time on universal credit.Duncan Smith, who was the secretary of state for work and pensions between 2010 and 2015, acknowledges\u0026nbspproblems with the way the system has been put into effect.\u0026nbspHe even resigned in 2015 because the finance minister at the time, George Osborne, cut an additional £4bn\u0026nbspfrom the welfare budget. “I thought that was too much,” Duncan Smith says.But “the system itself is the right system,” he adds. “Though a large number of working families are still in poverty, they were in deeper poverty when they were out of work. As they move into work, they’re better off.”Back at McCullough’s, the father’s eyes well\u0026nbspup as his phone buzzes\u0026nbspwith debt notices from the local water board, and he describes\u0026nbsphow he struggles\u0026nbspto provide his son with some of the basic things in life – like fresh vegetables, new clothes and haircuts.McCullough voted Conservative in past elections and says he would do so again if an election were held tomorrow. Despite his travails, he supports the party’s cautious approach to state spending, and he thinks there are too many people expecting handouts for nothing.But he no longer believes that restructuring benefits will get more people into work, or more children out of poverty.“Until you walk a mile in someone’s shoes, you can’t know,” McCullough says. “Until you’ve seen how it works, you don’t understand.”In Morecambe, the area’s Conservative MP\u0026nbspDavid Morris\u0026nbspsays in an email that child poverty had fallen in his constituency, and blames\u0026nbsp“left-wing political activists” for any suggestion to the contrary. In previous interviews, he has accused headteacher Collingwood of having political motivations for speaking out.But the demand for free breakfasts at Morecambe Bay Primary is not the only warning sign.The relative child poverty rate in Morris’s constituency rose to 25.9 per cent from 2013 to 2017, up from 24.2 per cent, according to research by the Centre\u0026nbspfor Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. That may not sound like much, but the rise has produced marked changes on the ground.How social supermarkets are filling a gap in austerity BritainAt the Morecambe Bay Foodbank, for instance, the number of children who received at least one parcel of free food has almost doubled to 1,229 in 2017-18, from 656 in 2013-14. At the local branch of Citizens Advice the number of food vouchers distributed to children in the same period increased sixfold, to 1,336 from 222.In Morecambe, the problem is compounded by cuts to local children’s services. Before austerity, schools could quickly refer vulnerable families to a local state-funded children’s centre, where social workers would work with children and parents to solve their problems.Since 2010, however, roughly 1,000 of these centres have been closed across Britain after about £990m\u0026nbspin funding cuts. Those that remain – such as those in the Morecambe area – have substantially reduced their capacity.“The caseload is growing, and the system\u0026nbspby which we would have supported them is diminishing,” Collingwood says. “We feel much more like an island.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”Trump cancels trip to Ireland after massive protests plannedWe both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in pictures Show all 55Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Dieter Zetsche, outgoing head of the brand, told Paris Motor Show attendees that he had begun negotiations with Nissan regarding potentially using its Sunderland plant to build Mercedes-Benz cars. “Before Brexit there was one project where we were looking at an option of producing cars in Sunderland together,” he said. Mercedes-Benz owner Daimler formed an alliance with Nissan and Renault in 2010. Earlier this year, Nissan announced that it was cutting hundreds of jobs at the Sunderland operation, due to falling demand for diesel vehicles. Mr Zetsche shared no further details about the now-abandoned plan, The Times reported. A number of other carmakers issued warnings at the Paris event, with Toyota stating that a no-deal Brexit would lead to a temporary stoppage in UK production, primarily at its Burnaston plant. Toyota warns no-deal Brexit would stop UK productionAston Martin cuts target share price for stock market listingUK car manufacturing falls again as industry demands Brexit safeguardUK car sales plunged 20 per cent in SeptemberJohan van Zyl, the Japanese company’s Europe president, said it was difficult to predict how long the stoppage period would last. Meanwhile, Maxime Picat, executive vice president for Europe at Vauxhall owner PSA, said leaving the EU with no deal would disrupt production. “We’ve been doing all we can to develop our UK business, restore Vauxhall and Opel profitability, reinvesting in Luton and improving our sites’ competitiveness in order to help them face up to an uncertain future,” he said. “But there are limits. Those limits are customs barriers and the loss of freedom of movement, for people and goods. If we get to that point, we will be obliged to take measures.“If we suddenly have to start manufacturing for the UK in the UK, and for Europe in Europe, there will necessarily be an impact on UK production.”Several carmakers have called for Brexit negotiators to avoid a no-deal scenario, warning that such a departure would hit production and investment in the market. BMW recently said it would bring a planned shutdown of its Oxford plant forward to begin on the same day the UK leaves the EU, in a bid to minimise the potential disruption a no-deal Brexit would create.Meanwhile, Honda has said that a no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds, while Jaguar Land Rover has moved workers at its Castle Bromwich plant to a three-day week because of “continuing headwinds impacting the car industry”.Ralf Speth, Jaguar’s boss, has previously warned that tens of thousands of jobs in the UK motor industry are at risk if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead.He also said the current lack of clarity around Brexit means he does not know if his plants will be able to function after 29 March 2019, and added that interruptions to production could cost up to £60m a day.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The committee said “dubious” advisers and “parasitical” introducers, had “shamelessly bamboozled” thousands of pension scheme members.In the British Steel case, savers moved £1.1bn of pensions out of the company’s “gold-plated” defined-benefit scheme into riskier funds with high management fees as a result of bad advice.Labour will punish water firm shareholders for pension fund deficitsThe state pension age increase gave women like me no chance to planIt is outrageous the DWP won’t let us see how much is in our pensionFamilies miss out on key pension rights linked to child benefitThe true scale of the scandal is not yet known but estimates suggest billions of pounds of savings could be affected. Only half of advice on defined-benefit transfers meets required standards, research by the FCA found.Explaining the decision not to ban contingent fees, the FCA said it was a “complex area” and that the evidence did show that the payments were not the main cause of bad outcomes for customers.Some changes were announced on Thursday including a requirement for all pension transfer specialists to hold a specific qualification for providing advice on investments by October 2020.The FCA said it also expects advisers to consider their client’s attitude to, and understanding of, the risks of giving up safeguarded benefits for flexible benefits.\u0026nbspJonathan Camfield, a partner at pension consultants LCP, welcomed the improvements but said he was disappointed at the lack of action on contingent charging.“There are significant concerns around some of the contingent charging practices of IFAs, concerns that are increasingly being expressed by our clients, trustees and sponsoring employers of DB schemes,” he said, adding that it is important that the regulator tightens rules as soon as possible in order to protect pension savers.Christopher Woolard, FCA\u0027s executive director of strategy and competition said: “Any changes to our rules on contingent charging could have implications for the supply of advice.\u0026nbsp“Because of the significance of this issue to all stakeholders in the market, we will carry out further analysis and consult on new interventions if appropriate in the first half of next year.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

If confirmed by follow-up Hubble observations, the finding could provide vital clues about the development of planetary systems and may cause experts to revisit theories of how moons form around planets.The new moon is far bigger than any of the nearly 200 natural satellites that have been found in our own solar system. It is comparable in size to its\u0026nbspplanets, roughly the same size as Neptune – orbiting a planet as big as Jupiter.The two are floating around their own star 8,000 lightyears away.Nasa releases statement about bizarre International Space Station leakIt was found in the same way that scientists discovered those thousands of exoplanets: watching for the small dips that happens when they move in front of their star, and working out from those how big it is and what its orbit might be like.They looked at data from\u0026nbsp284 planets found in that way by the Kepler Space Telescope and tried to find those that had anything strange about their orbits.One of those planets, known as Kepler 1625b, seemed to be behaving strangely.\u0026nbspWe saw little deviations and wobbles in the light curve that caught our attention, Kipping said.They watched the planet for some time, and noticed that soon after it passed in front of its star, there was another dip of light, which appeared to be a moon trailing the planet like a dog following its owner on a leash.It also seemed to be passing in front of its star slightly sooner that might be expected, which would be consistent with the kind of wobble that would happen because of a moon\u0027s gravity.\u0026nbspAn extraterrestrial civilization watching the Earth and Moon transit the Sun would note similar anomalies in the timing of Earth\u0027s transit, Kipping said.It is possible that the strange behaviour could also be caused by another planet in the system, and hope for further data from space telescopes to confirm their findings. But at the moment a companion moon is the most convincing explanation for the dip in the light and the change in the orbit, they said.Exomoons are so difficult to find because they are so small, and as a consequence the dip they cause in the light coming from the star is much weaker than a larger planet. Their orbits also shift as they move around their star, because they orbiting their planet.The new moon was probably found first because its larger size made it easier to see.Both of the planets are within the habitable zone, where they are close enough to their star to get heat and support life but not so close that it would be killed by the intensity. But both planets are gaseous and so are unlikely to support life.The gaseous nature of the planet also lead to questions about where its Moon might have come from. Our Moon, for instance, is thought to have been formed when an earlier collision shot off material that would go on to become the rock we see today, but that could not happen if the two objects are made up of gas.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

As a rule, they are so far away that they prove difficult to observe directly from Earth.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 Earth from the ISSFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

But the entire episode remains completely mysterious, as both space agencies scramble to find out how the apparently drilled hole could have been made in the outside of the space station.Nasa has refused to announce any of the findings of those investigations so far. But it released the statement after reports in Russia that the hole had been drilled on purpose, since it was not a manufacturing defect.Russian media recently reported that General Director Rogozin said the hole was not a manufacturing defect. Ruling out a manufacturing defect indicates that this is an isolated issue which does not categorically affect future production, it wrote.This conclusion does not necessarily mean the hole was created intentionally or with mal-intent. NASA and Roscosmos are both investigating the incident to determine the cause. The International Space Station Program is tentatively planning a spacewalk in November to gather more information.Nasa\u0026nbspalso said that one of its astronauts as well as Russian Cosmonaut will be heading to the International Space Station in October. During that launch, Nasa\u0027s\u0026nbspAdministrator Jim Bridenstine will speak\u0026nbspwith Mr Rogozin, in their first in-person meeting, during which the leak will presumably be discussed.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

But\u0026nbspnow, once the Tory conference is over, we should get down to business.”Speaking alongside\u0026nbspLeo Varadkar, the Irish president, Mr Tusk made clear the EU remained “united behind Ireland” in its determination to prevent a return to border posts and checks.But he also made clear his anger at the delay to Theresa May’s promised fresh border proposals – linking it to a reluctance to risk a backlash at the Tory conference.In Birmingham, Mr Hunt, the foreign secretary, triggered fury across the EU by accusing it of trying to keep the UK in a “prison” with behaviour similar to the Soviet Union.After the Salzburg summit, the prime minister accused Mr Tusk of showing disrespect, but he tuned that accusation on the UK, saying: “In respecting our partners, we expect the same in return.“Comparing the European Union to the Soviet Union is as unwise as it is insulting. The Soviet Union was about prisons and gulags, borders and walls, violence against citizens and neighbours.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

In the year to date, car sales are 7.5 per cent behind where they were this time last year.The SMMT said the decline in September followed an “unusually high August and a turbulent first eight months of the year as the market responded to a raft of upheavals”\u0026nbspmainly changes to diesel policy after new emissions standards were introduced. UK car sales drop as manufacturers warn Brexit is hurting industryUK car sales drop as diesel demand plummets for 14th month in a rowUK car sales expected to drop for two years, warns motor industry bodyMike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: “With the industry given barely a year to reapprove the entire European model lineup, it’s no surprise that we’ve seen bottlenecks and a squeeze on supply. These are exceptional circumstances with similar declines seen in other major European markets. “The good news is that, as backlogs ease, consumers and businesses can look forward to a raft of exciting high-tech cars and a market keen to recover lost momentum.”Ian Plummer, Auto Trader director, said 2018 has been “very challenging for both retailers and manufacturers, with the fuel debate and Brexit anxieties denting consumer confidence, and inflationary pressure on exchange rates hitting profits”. However, he added: “Despite the many economic uncertainties, there is some positive news on the horizon for 2019 too. The plethora of new electric and hybrid vehicles that are on display at this week’s Paris Motor Show are not far from hitting forecourts, giving consumers some great new choices in this emerging fuel type which grew again last month.“What’s more, as more consumers move away from traditional ownership to usership models, the appetite for finance remains exceptionally strong.”However, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said consumers were unlikely to begin buying cars in great numbers in the near future. “Finance costs likely will continue to rise gradually, while the recent rise in motor fuel prices might dissuade some first-time buyers. High levels of saving intentions also suggest that buyers will be cautious when considering major purchases. Accordingly, the chance of a substantial revival in car sales over the next six months remains slim,” he said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

The one known as\u0026nbsp802.11ac is WiFi 5, and\u0026nbsp802.11n is WiFi\u0026nbsp4.“For nearly two decades, WiFi users have had to sort through technical naming conventions to determine if their devices support the latest WiFi,” said Edgar Figueroa, president and CEO of Wi-Fi Alliance. “WiFi Alliance is excited to introduce WiFi 6, and present a new naming scheme to help industry and WiFi users easily understand the WiFi generation supported by their device or connection.”As well as being easier for people to understand, the new name will be able to fit into screens on phones and computers. That will let people know how they are connected to WiFi, for instance, and tell them whether they should expect faster or slower speeds.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Monthly horoscope for October: What is YOUR zodiac reading forecast?                Daily Horoscope on October 4: Star sign reading, zodiac, astrology In Understanding Science - How Science Really Works - a series for the UC Museum of Palaeontology, UC Berkeley said there are zero cases of astrology contributing to any scientific discovery.University of Berkeley, CaliforniaSimilarly, astrologers do not use the scientific method to create their predictions and forecasts are typically too vague to be trusted.UC Berkeley wrote: \u0026ldquoIn the few cases where astrology has been used to generate testable expectations and the results were examined in a careful study, the evidence did not support the validity of astrological ideas.\u0026ldquoThis experience is common in science \u0026mdash scientists often test ideas that turn out to be wrong.                October Horoscope: Monthly horoscope prediction, zodiac and astrology\u0026ldquoHowever, one of the hallmarks of science is that ideas are modified when warranted by the evidence.\u0026ldquoAstrology has not changed its ideas in response to contradictory evidence.Another major problem is most people are under the impression they were born under one particular zodiac sign when in reality they are completely different.This happens because the zodiac, as it was created thousands of years ago, did not account for the Earth wobbling in its orbit around the Sun.Daily horoscopes track the Sun and the Moon\u0027s position in the zodiacs (Image: )Daily horoscope: There are 12 signs in the commonly used zodiac calendar (Image: )This wobble, known as precession, has caused the intersecting point between the celestial equator and the Sun\u0026rsquos ecliptic in the sky to shift by 36 degrees.Over the 2,500 years that people have been using the zodiac to predetermine their lives, the signs have moved into different positions and are invalid today.For instance, a person born between March 21 and April 19 might think they are an\u0026nbspAries,\u0026nbspwhen in reality they were born in Pisces.The Sun\u0026rsquos recession moved each sign by almost an entire month, further questioning the validity of daily horoscopes.

Monthly horoscope for October: What is YOUR zodiac reading forecast?                Daily Horoscope on October 4: Star sign reading, zodiac, astrology When the ancient Babylonians devised the zodiac nearly 3,000 years ago, the astrological signs were based on the Sun\u0026rsquos movements at the time.The Babylonian established 12 constellations in the zodiac calendar despite the fact there were actually 13 zodiacs.NASA said: \u0026ldquoTo make a tidy match with their 12-month calendar, the Babylonians ignored the fact that the Sun actually moves through 13 constellations, not 12.\u0026ldquoThen they assigned each of those 12 constellations equal amounts of time.\u0026ldquoBesides the 12 familiar constellations of the zodiac, the Sun is also aligned with Ophiuchus for about 18 days each year.Ophiuchus is the missing 13th constellation avoided by the Babylonians so that the zodiac would fit their pre-existing 12-month calendar.The zodiac constellations are also different shapes and sizes, meaning the Sun spends varying amounts of time in each.For instance, the line extending from the Earth through the Sun towards Virgo lasts around 45 days.                October Horoscope: Monthly horoscope prediction, zodiac and astrology                Daily Horoscope: Fact or fiction - Are horoscopes and astrology real?But if you were to track the Sun\u0026rsquos position in Scorpio, it would only last seven days.There is also the issue of precession and the Sun no longer moving through the sky in the same way it did 3,000 years ago.As the Earth barrels around the Sun, the planet wobbles on its orbit as a result of the gravitational attraction between the Moon and the equatorial bulge.Day-to-day the wobble is inconsequential but over thousands of years since the Babylonians, the Sun\u0026rsquos ecliptic has shifted by about 36 degrees.Daily horoscopes: The modern zodiac calendar was devised by the ancient Babylonians (Image: )Daily Horoscope: Astronomers claim the zodiac is out of synch with the Sun (Image: )As a result, the zodiac constellations have moved their positions to be approximately one month out of synch with your daily horoscopes.Someone born under the sign of Aries most likely was born under the sign of Pisces and so on.Below are the updated horoscope dates, which take into account the Sun\u0026rsquos precession.Capricorn \u0026ndash January 20 to February 16.Aquarius \u0026ndash February 16 to March 11.Pisces \u0026ndash March 11 to April 18.Aries \u0026ndash April 18 to May 13.Taurus \u0026ndash May 13 to June 21.Gemini \u0026ndash June 21 to July 20.Cancer \u0026ndash July 20 to August 10.Leo \u0026ndash August 10 to September 16.Virgo \u0026ndash September 16 to October 30.Libra \u0026ndash October 30 to November 23.Scorpio \u0026ndash November 23 to November 29.Ophiuchus \u0026ndash November 29 to December 17.Sagittarius \u0026ndash December 17 to January 20.

Nobody is hoping for voter-friendly treats.For a man in charge of our economic destiny at such a momentous time, this “stubby-pencilled accountant” has precious little to say. It seems he even remained mute at a recent Cabinet session to war-game a No-Deal Brexit — surely the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s special subject.Well-informed Spectator editor Fraser Nelson says other ministers piled in with upbeat projects but Hammond “seemed to have no ideas and kept quiet”. Spreadsheet Phil possesses either supreme self-confidence or total contempt for the .million who voted for Brexit, or both.The man who a year ago faced political death has become the most powerful figure in Theresa May’s Cabinet — perhaps including herself.She remains the figurehead. But the minister she planned to axe until her botched General Election is running the Brexit show from his Treasury eyrie.Hammond’s sympathetic image as Eeyore, a woebegone soft toy, is misleading. This man combines thin-skinned arrogance with a rare combination of political disabilities — cloth-eared, ham-fisted and leaden-footed.The grey image of bungled Budgets and barren creativity stands in vivid contrast to his outrageous Project Fear scaremongering. Mrs May certainly deserves blame for her hapless EU negotiations and the mutant Chequers plan for a Hi-HoBrexit.THE Tories have made a decent start to their conference – but they need to set their ambitions higher.Last week the Labour Party promised easy answers on everything from housing to the economy. It was a radical,utterly disastrous, vision for Britain.The Government changing tipping rules and increasing taxes on foreign property buyers is pretty small beer.Not least since the former was first announced three years ago and the latter is pretty much copied from last year’s Labour manesto.Philip Hammond — rarely mistaken for a ray of sunshine — needs to provide light at the end of the austerity tunnel.He must lay the groundwork for entrepreneurs to thrive in a newly liberated, unapologetically free market economy.And he should challenge business to work with him, too. The self-appointed “voices of British business”, iniably dominated by large corporate interests, push every day for more and more Brexit concessions.Yet as last week showed, Labour’s unreconstructed Marxism is a far more serious threat to future prosperity than any kind of Brexit.It’s time for big businesses to play their part in building a better Britain, rather than refighting a referendum which was as much a vote against them as the political establishment.Eeyore Hammond must encourage them to invest in Britain’s future.She survived last year’s election catastrophe only because Remainers feared a true Brexiteer such as Boris Johnson might replace her.Hammond has since deployed his Treasury reach to capitalise on her weakness and box us into BRINO — Brexit In Name Only. Mrs May is the willing captive of passionate Remainers in Downing Street, Whitehall, the Cabinet Office and, crucially, the all-powerful Treasury.Since the departure of close aide Nick Timothy, there is nobody within earshot who voted Brexit — including Mrs May. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, like his predecessor David Davis, has virtually no say in negotiations.Hammond now calls the shots, backed by panic-stirring Business Secretary Greg Clark and Europhile Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.Brexiteers fear this Unholy Trinity is ready for more concessions over issues including migration, EU benefits and Britain’s vital financial services industry.Never forget, it was Hammond who blocked all spending and therefore all serious preparation for No Deal, a prospect now apparently facing this nation. In fact there was never a chance of No Deal.We will end up with a form of Chequers, but one even more pro-Brussels than the proposal which saw David Davis and BoJo storm out. Remainers are back in full Project Fear mode.European car firms are happily pouring billions into Britain — despite Brexit. Yet Greg Clark triggered last week’s chorus of fake alarm from Toyota, claiming its “just-in-time” supply chain would grind to a halt.This ignores the whole point of “just-in-time”. It is designed specically to cope with delivery glitches and operates worldwide in all circumstances under global trade rules.It was also Clark who handed Brussels its biggest anti-Brexit card by promising those shroud-waving car giants the UK would remain under EU rules. That led directly to Mrs May’s surrender over the Northern Ireland border, which has plagued negotiations ever since.It is a tragic fact — but no surprise — that we are now heading remorselessly for a deal on EU terms at our expense.EU leaders were never going to see us thrive outside. They insisted we will not be better off after Brexit.Anyone who hoped we might be set free to compete on equal terms should read ex-Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis’ story of his own country’s punishment beating.It was Varoufakis who compared Brexit with the Eagles’ hit: “It’s like Hotel Calornia — you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.” And we can blame Phil Hammond for blocking the fire Brexits.But Ms Jourova, a Czech raised under Soviet rule, wants Corbyn-style “regulation” of the free Press.The apple never falls far from the tree.PS.

It was a quiet week, so I watched the first four episodes and, to my surprise and delight, I hated Press even more than I expected.The set-up’s the deal-breaker, of course. We’ve got a right-wing red-top called The Post, that’s very obviously meant to be The Sun, and a left-wing broadsheet The Herald, which is equally obviously , house Bible of the BBC.The former is edited by soul-selling clone Duncan Allen, played by the brilliant Ben Chaplin, who does actually resemble a couple of ex-colleagues.By rights then, the female lead should be The Herald’s editor, Amina Chaudury, played by Priyanga Burford.But she can’t act, so the responsibility’s fallen to Charlotte Riley as northern, working-class brick of Deputy News Editor Holly Evans, who fits the social profile of your averagewoman about as comfortably as Roy Chubby Brown fits a mankini.Next weird thing you probably notice about Press is that nearly all the characters are giving speeches, rather than talking normally to each other.Especially the insufferable broadsheet hacks, who never stop reminding each other “we speak the truth to the powerful”, and that “people buy The Herald for the truth”.Why do people buy The Post Sun It’s never really occurred to writer Mike “Doctor Foster” Bartlett, who clearly didn’t read our newspaper before he sat down to type Press, at his desk on the summit of Mount Olympus, and has probably never met a tabloid reader either, without telling them: “Keep the change.”How can I be so sure Because it’s got almost every single professional and technical aspect wrong, from Duncan’s insistence he’s going to do a spread “On page five and six” , to the week one headline The Post produced about the gay, blackmailed footballer who committed suicide: “Parents never knew their son.”Which is the sort of meaningless, esoteric b******s that would get thrown back at a student newspaper sub.That’s another unconvincing thing about Press, incidentally. No one swears. And I wouldn’t mind so muchthere were some decent stories to see us through, but there aren’t.There’s a Katie Hopkins figure floating around, a few cut-and-pasted bits of very old tabloid legendand some deep state conspiracy cobblers, which the BBC’s probably got written into Raa Raa The Noisy Lion these days.Duncan also has the vague hots for Holly, until such time as Ed off the newsdesk tells him she likes having it off in a grey vest.That’s about your lot, though.As always happens when British TV tries to dramatise the Press, the writer’s left-of-centre political agenda and prejudices trump everything .This is why Americans do it so much better, andyou want to see how newspapers really operate you’ll get a much better idea from Billy Wilder’s  film The Front Page than you ever will from Press.I’ll say this for the BBC production team though, they might not have much of an ear for newspaper dialogue, but they’ve got a hell of an eye for interior design and have duplicated one item of our office kitchen crockery perfectly.Mugs.“I don’t bend in the middle any more, to be honest.”Then just slap him around a bit.Improvise, woman.FURTHER proof,it were needed, there’s not a single television format that can’t be improved by the presence of one or two of the Happy Mondays arrived on Friday.A special BBC Music Day edition of Bargain Hunt, featuring Bez and Rowetta versus Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle, which will go down in daytime TV folklore.Attempting to keep them in some sort of order, at the Kent showground’s antique fair, was BH regular Charlie Ross, who didn’t get very far with his preliminary question: “How did it all start with the Happy Mondays, Bez ”“You really don’t want to know.”So you really couldn’t blame him for looking a bit nervous when he sent the pair of them away with £ in used notes.Half an hour later, though, Bez and Rowetta were back, with three items, including a biscuit tin and a to-die-for rustic, bygone horse collar mirror that’s yours for just  quid.It made them a respectable £ profit at auction, as well, and flattened Pulp’s efforts in the process.At which point things got a bit dark.Charlie noted “an irregularity”, the Mondays were hauled back on set, like guilty schoolkids, and the host was forced to explain that the winsome and very obliging woman at the back of the auction hall, who kept bidding for his items was in fact: “Bez’s girlfriend.”Not angry, Bez, just disappointed.IF you’ve never seen the brilliant Simpsons episode where Homer gives Pinchy, his pet lobster, a really hot bath, Google it as soon as you can.Then immediately after, watch Channel ’s darkly funny latest episode of Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls, where a pig wandered into camp, on Sunday night.Even more obligingly it then started fattening itself up on the celebs’ leftovers and inviting the obvious by crapping its load everywhere.While some sensed dinner, Towie’s Pete Wicks had a better idea.He named the pig Colin, took it for a walk and then tethered it with a rope to some rocks.Whereupon Colin, with the sort of demonic squeals and grunts you last heard on Deliverance, promptly strangled himself to death.Presented with this tragedy, you or I or Martin Kemp from Spandau Ballet, might’ve drawn the obvious conclusion and, like Homer Simpson, tucked in Not this lot.Instead Colin was buried at sea, with full military honours, to avoid “hurting Pete’s feelings”, floating off into the sunset like a warning to humanity.This MorningSemra Haksever: “I call myself an eclectic witch, so I take dferent little bits of magic from all over the place.So it’s all b******sOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In contrast, the over-s are positively chipper: Only  per cent of this group reported feelings of isolation.Now, I’m  and, depressingly, these statistics don’t surprise me.At first glance, it looks like young people have it easy when it comes to making friends.At  or thereabouts, more than  per cent of them will be packed off to university where they’ll move in with a group of like-minded people of the same age and be encouraged to drink and party like there’s no tomorrow.Which, when you’re only required to stumble out of bed for one pm lecture, there essentially isn’t.Rather than relying on friends of tenuous friends for dubious introductions, young people these days can simply download an app and get the details of thousands of eligible strangers delivered straight to their mobile phones.Add into the mix social media ­— which allows its users to connect with everyone they’ve ever met instantaneously at any given moment — and it’s hard to imagine how any young people could possibly be lonely, let alone  per cent.But there are two sides to every coin.University — though a godsend when it comes to meeting new people — can be a problem when it comes to staying in touch with them. Saddled with bottomless debt, young graduates simply don’t have the cash to socialise.When a round for six at a London pub will set you back  quid, is it any wonder that more and more young people are opting to stay at home Dating apps, too, come with their pitfalls. Yes, it’s nice to have a database of singletons in your pocket, but the ubiquity of Tinder and Bumble mean it’s now considered almost socially awkward to speak to someone you fancy in person.A friend of mine, who has absolutely no problem propositioning women on Tinder, hasn’t yet found the courage to ask for his next-door neighbour’s number, four months after she moved in.As for social media, young people like me are increasingly discovering that “staying connected” is a mixed blessing at best. With no excuse to lose touch, my generation holds on to friends we’ve outgrown, leaving us with no time to make new ones. It may sound callous, but there’s an art to shedding friends, and thanks to our social media addiction, we seem to have lost it.What’s more, earnest  to -year-olds seem to be taking to heart the faddish health advice that adults have been merrily ignoring for years, making it even harder for them to socialise because they fear alcohol, and even food.At the end of a recent party I got chatting to a fun young woman, so I suggested some pub grub at a boozer to round off the evening. How wrong I was.She explained in detail she was vegan and on a gluten-free diet , so the pub menu would not cater for her needs.I decided not to pursue it.So I say it’s time snowflake millennials took a bit of responsibility for their own feelings of isolation.Last month commentators wagged their fingers at the big tech companies after a survey by charity YoungMinds revealed a greater number of young people view social media as having a negative impact on the way they feel about themselves than those who report a positive impact.But it was never suggested depressed young people should simply put away their phones and do something .Mollycoddled millennials believe having a thriving social circle is a human right, rather than an ongoing project.Instead of popping to the pub for a pick-me-up with whoever happens to be around, a lonely young person will all too often turn to the internet for a spot of indulgent self-reflection, or to the gym for Insta-friendly self-improvement.As a result, pubs are closing at a rate of  a day, and sites such as Tumblr are overflowing with posters instructing users to “forget the haters” and “shine like the star that you are”.Of course, social media is made to be addictive. But surely putting down a phone can’t be an insurmountable challenge for an educated generation of young people  Dwelling on yourself is the surest route to a lonely lestyle, so instead of posting doleful, introspective memes on social media or clinging to tired old friendships, lonely young people should find the guts to get outside and look outwards.Making and keeping real friends takes work, and it’s time young people started putting the hours in.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whoever convinced her it would be dead cool to walk on stage at the party conference and jig about to an Abba song needs a bit of invasive brain surgery, right now.It was like a remake of Re-Animator, or Night Of The Living Dead.There’s no point in Theresa trying to tell us she’s the le and soul of the party and actually a bloody good laugh.We know she isn’t. She’s about as charismatic as an underdone crumpet on a wet Sunday. But she doesn’t need to be Ginger Rogers. She’s the Prime Minister.And you have to give her credit for doggedly sticking to that role. EvenI’m not convinced she’s been doing it terribly well.But on Brexit — God, how mind-numbingly boring the whole thing is — she has a good point.I’m not a fan of her Chequers deal for us to leave the European Union. I think we’re giving too much away. I’d rather have a no-deal exit.But time is pressing. And I’m aware that while we Leavers won the referendum, the margin was comparatively small. So we ought to be gracious and accept a little bit of a compromise. Try to strike a respectable deal with those gangsters from insignicant countries.And a little further down the line, tweak the arrangements a little to suit us better. In the meantime, just strike the deal.And that means getting behind May and presenting a united front to Europe. Most of the Conservative MPs understand that, even the arch-Brexiteers like the excellent Michael Gove.But Bfo the Blundering Bear does not. I’m talking about Boris Johnson. Now he IS fun and good company. But he’s about as likely to become Prime Minister as I am to cop off with Emily Ratajkowski after a few pints and a quick meal at the Chicken Cottage.He has very little support among his political colleagues. He has a lot more among Conservative activists. But very little among voters north of Watford.And yet Bfo was at it again this week. Taking the p**s out of the Prime Minister. And making a rousing speech to his hardcore supporters. Demanding we tell the EU to stuff it.Well, there was a time when we should have told the EU to stuff it — two years ago when we first started negotiations.That time has passed. A lack of confidence from the Government and a ided party let us down.Now is the time to show a bit of unity and wring a deal out of the deathly bureaucrats. Maybe not the Chequers deal — May didn’t mention the word at all during her speech — but a version of it.Otherwise we’ll have a General Election on our hands. One the Tories will lose. And you’ll wake up to find John McDonnell is in charge of your finances and Diane Abbott is Home Secretary.Come on — surely that should concentrate the mind a little Hero of the week is Jane Lunnon, head of a girls’ school in South London.She has stuck the boot into “image-obsessed” reality TV – especially that coven of gurning and pouting imbeciles in Love Island, such as Megan Barton Hanson.Such programmes are “incredibly damaging” to young people, she reckons, calling them “trivial nonsense”.I think Jane is right. And the same goes for all those hyped-up talent shows where people with no talent – just a lust for fame – get judged on their appalling performances by people with no talent.Kids need to know the dference between fame for fame’s sake – and real achievement.Its horrible that Corine Remande has lost the sight in one eye after she was hit by a golf ball during the Ryder Cup.The poor woman was standing among spectators when Brooks Koepka’s tee shot hit her in the face.She’s now threatening legal action against the organisers. She says they didn’t give spectators enough protection.This is ludicrous. What were they supposed to do And what will happen is that in future crowds will be kept even further back from the action. Just because of one horrible accident.Wait until the same thing happens in cricket...The uni magazine said: “It was argued that the loud noise of traditional clapping and whooping pose an issue to students with anxiety or sensory issues. BSL clapping – or, jazz hands – would be a more inclusive form of expression.”With anxiety or sensory issues  What is wrong with these people They are “triggered” by almost everything. Especially by people who have views which dfer from their own.That REALLY triggers them. They shouldn’t be at university. They should be safe at home with mummy and daddy.That old windbag Mahathir Mohamad has been visiting the UK.Lovely to have him, of course. He’s the boss of Muslim-dominated Malaysia and he hates Jews.He was at it again over here.

Problem is, I can’t stand them, the middle class.And the thought of nearly four billion people eating avocado on toast while doing Pilates then listening to Coldplay in their Volvo XCs makes me feel terribly queasy.The human race is being taken over by the legions of the smug. Get me outta here.Visitors to the Telford Exotic Zoo were disappointed by the penguins. They just stood, stock still.This is because they are plastic model penguins.

It is dirty and unhygienic — a report out this week said it is a breeding ground for bugs.There is even a version of Monopoly with debit cards instead of notes. And last month we told you of the  century The Boot pub in Freston, Suffolk, the first boozer in the country to go cashless.This looming death has been around for a while. In August, the Bank of England said it was considering phasing out p and p coins. And ATMs are closing at a rate of  a month.Just  per cent of payments are cash, down from  per cent in . And those payments only account for three per cent in terms of the value of how much is spent.Paying on card has been on the rise ever since Barclaycard launched in , but cards too face being eclipsed by payments on mobile phones. Either way, both mean we need cash less. And that is not a bad thing, right Getting rid of cash would hit criminals and tax evaders hard as they do business in cash to make it harder for authorities to track the movement of money.Businesses would rejoice because they would not have to pay security guards to transport money and would not have to spend ages counting and bagging it.Some also reckon it is easier to keep a tab on finances when spending on cards or apps. You might forget buying that extra round at closing time in the pub, but your phone will always remember. And of course, you get consumer protection when using a credit card, along with reward points or cashback offers.Credit card firms make their money not just from interest payments but from taking a small fee for each transaction — so they offer us incentives to choose their cards. Use an Air Miles card and before long you could have a free flight to Paris or New York.More than a quarter of clothes in the UK are bought online — and you can’t use cash over the internet. As we move even more to buying online and via smartphone apps, cash will be needed less and less. Whether cash dies out in five years or  or  just depends on technology.But many are in no rush to see the back of it — and not just because of nostalgia for their old piggy banks. One consideration is: Can we entirely trust the banks to look after our money  Fraud is soaring as criminals take advantage of security issues around online banking. Banks blame customers but critics say banks need to take responsibility.We have featured victim after victim on The Sun Money columns, and they all say bank staff have turned their backs on them. There are millions of others who need cash simply because they rely on it to pay for things day to day. And it is the less well off or elderly who rely on it the most.Consumer magazine Which  — which has been campaigning against the loss of banks and ATMs — has produced research showing poorer families and older folk are hardest hit.Gareth Shaw of Which  said: “ATM and branch closures are threatening to leave behind the millions who still rely on cash. Our research highlights lower-income families and older generations will be among the worst hit.”In June, services from Visa, one of the three main card providers along with Mastercard and American Express, went down with technical issues — highlighting the risk of being solely reliable on cards and phones. “When the trolley came around on the train and the card payment wasn’t working, the only people who could eat were those with cash,” one banker explained.And what about hospitality workers  The Government has said all tips, evenon cards, must go to staff — but we all know some unscrupulous bosses will not do that. Like many, I prefer to give my tips in cash so I know the waiter or waitress gets it all.Charity collectors often have card machines now but collections for most churches, schools and small local good causes still rely on tins and the rattle of coins.Cash may well be dying out, but I still make sure I always keep some coins in my pocket just in case. And I have older relatives who still feel most comfortable with coins and notes.So until we have a population where everyone feels happy when using a card or phone, I will be rooting against a completely cashless Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I knew instantly it was my car.I was with a mechanic dealing with a Ferrari and I heard a smashing noise. It was a massive bang.The van driver was sat there staring into space afterwards. He nearly went in too.It took workers around six hours to fish the submerged speedster from the canal.

It was only parked outside so I could photograph it.The most expensive car in Mr Cauldwells stock is a rare  Aston Martin V worth £,.Many social media users who witnessed the splash thought the submerged speedster was an original Porsche , which is priced at around £,.The AutoVero director added: It could have been much worse, definitely. It is just an item of stock at the end of the day, not my pride and joy.The driver managed to slide past a Mercedes that was there as well.I park my cars there all the time, you just dont dream that somebody is going to do that.He is now preparing to deal with insurers and expects the car is a total loss.He added: I have never ever had a claim like this before and I doubt I will have one again.AutoVero is the sole distributor of Vintage Speedsters in the UK.It is not yet know why the van driver reversed into the car, but it is believed to have been an accident.The Sun Online has asked the politan Policethey are investigating the incident."},{"url":null,"title":"schools shut london false widow spiders","story":"Two primary schools and two secondary schools have closed after Britains most venomous spider was found on site.The discovery of the spiders were made by Newhams Environmental Team in east London.Pest control teams are now working to bring the outbreak under control before any more eggs hatch.One of the schools affected, Rokeby secondary in Canning Town, will remain shut until October .Star Primary in Beckton, Ellen Wilkinson Primary in Canning Town and Lister Community School in Plaistow have also had to close until further notice.Rokeby head teacher, Charlotte Robinson, said a pest control company estimated it would take three weeks to clear the spiders.In a letter to parents of the school’s  pupils, she wrote: “I have had to take the dficult decision to close Rokeby School to students and staff until Monday, October .“We have engaged a company to deal with and eradicate this pest, they have estimated that this will take up to three weeks.“The safety and wellbeing of students and staff must be our priority so whilst I understand that this may be very inconvenient for you it is in your child’s best interest to remain at home and not at school.”Lister Community School head teacher Anthony Wilson said he hoped his school would re-open by Friday.He added: “Investigations suggest that there may be some of these spiders on our site, and we are therefore following advice from the local authority and will be closing the school as a precaution to allow full investigation.”Lisle Von Buchenroder, headteacher at Star Primary and Sue Ferguson, headteacher of Ellen Wilkinson said they were looking at alternative venues so lessons could continue.False widow spiders are about the size of a p coin and are the most dangerous spider species in the UK.Their bites can be very painful and leave small puncture marks on the skin.A Newham Council spokeswoman said: “The spiders only bitemishandled or provoked. The venom is not particularly potent.“The schools are being treated and fumigated and we are working with the schools to ensure that children can continue to receive an education whilst their school is closed.Pupils are being set work via the schools and will remain in contact with schools.“We are asking all our schools and nurseries to proactively check their premises carefully for these spiders andthey see any signs, then contact environmental health or pest control.”False widow spiders are distinctive for their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.Millions of  widows, Britains most venomous spider, have been found across the UK and the population is believed to be growing.The species has a brown bulbous abdomen with cream markings that look like a skull. They have long legs and can reach about mm in size.Also known as steatoda nobilis, the spider is frequently confused for the black widow, which has deadly venom."},{"url":null,"title":"moment 30000 litres of prosecco bursts from tank after an explosion at italian winery","story":"Prosecco lovers around the world wished they could have raised a glass – or even a bucket – to help scoop up the bubbly waterfall.The pressurised tank exploded in Conegliano, Veneto, in the province of Treviso, with video footage of the wasted wine posted on Facebook by the Lenoteca Zanardo Giussano winery.But instead of being popping mad, the Prosecco producers simply confessed there was “too much must in the silos”.Must is freshly crushed wine juice that contains the skins, sees and stems of grapes, which is used for fermentation.Seeing the popular Italian sparkling wine cascading onto the floor was too much for some Prosecco fans, with one posting that people should “observe a minute of silence” while others described it as a “tragedy” and a “waste”.More than million people have watched video footage of the , litres of booze overflowing after Zanardo Guissano posted the dramatic event on its Facebook page.Among them was Shane McLeod Brennan, who said: “I would grab as many containers, bottles, bags, cups and the report would be ‘Shane died doing what he loved the most’ attempting to drink a , litre bottle of wine.”Upset Prosecco fan Marco Cerizzi said: “Noooooo.

And this offer remains in place. The EU is serious about getting the best possible deal.The EUs Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier suggested last month Britain would have to settle for a Canada-style trade deal - which is what many Brexiteers want too.But Mrs May has ruled it out - saying it would break up Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.She said a No Deal situation would be better than the Canada model as it would be bad for the country.In a searing address Mr Tusk also lashed the foreign secretary over his Soviet Union jibe and the PM over her demand Brussels shows more respect.Mr Hunt was blasted earlier this week of accusing the EU of seeking to punish the UK to keep the club together.And today Mr Tusk fumed: In respecting our partners, we expect the same in .

Tusk and the ERG agree on Canada plus plus plus. The problem with Chequers is it asks too much of the EU, needs too many concessions or ‘cherries’.But the EU must concede that the Irish border issue is resolvable via checks away from the border, not via backstop which threatens to ide the UK.He went on: This can be the basis of an excellent deal that gets through Westminster and the European Parliament and Council.It’s time to recognise Chequers is not going to work and will merely result in no deal.And ex Ukip leader Nigel Farage implored: Please Mrs May, bite his hand off."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds maggots ketchup dispenser cambridge","story":"Bella Ritchie shared a stomach-churning video of the live maggots inside the ketchup on her Twitter page.She said the revolting footage was filmed in a McDonalds in Cambridge.Writing on Twitter yesterday she said: Never going near the ketchup in McDonalds again.I told one member of staff and she literally just ignored me and carried on serving customers.We had to literally stop someone from eating it because they didn’t realise.

Ministers published documents confirming we will need to have passports that are valid for AT LEAST six monthswe want guaranteed entry into countries in the EU. That means some valid British passports will be completely useless in our neighbouring countrieswe leave without striking a deal.  Basically, the documents say that without a deal, British citizens risk being treated the same as those from outside the EU in the borderless Schengen zone. The documents state: If you plan to travel to the Schengen area after  March , to avoid any possibility of your adult British passport not complying with the Schengen Border Code we suggest that you check the issue date and make sure your passport is no older than  years and  months on the day of travel. For example,you’re planning to travel to the Schengen area on  March , your passport should have an issue date on or after  October . If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel. These same rules apply to both adult and childrens passports - and the government recommends renewing as soon as possible as the passport issuing service can get busy.

Sebastien Anderson was two-and-a-half times the legal alcohol limit when he crashed into Pamela and John Richards Nissan Micra on February  this year. The couple, who were described as pillars of the local community, had just been to the Etihad Stadium to see their beloved Manchester City beat Leicester -.Traffic officers later described it as an utterly avoidable collision caused by a selfish and arrogant man, Manchester Evening News reports. Mrs Richards, , suffered fatal injuries and her husband John, , remains in a neuro-rehabilitation unit after Andersons VW Golf smashed into them. Anderson, , was jailed for nine years and eight months after pleading guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by dangerous driving. He remained emotionless in the dock as he was sentenced by Judge Martin Walsh at Manchester Crown Court. Mr Richards was driving with his we of  years in the passenger seat. He pulled out of Bennett Street onto Hyde Road in east Manchester, a journey well-known to the couple, the court was previously told.  Anderson, who already had two previous drink driving convictions on his record and a known alcohol problem, had drunk wine before travelling on Hyde Road at around pm. The defendant accelerated on the mph road and began to overtake a taxi. It is estimated that he was travelling between  and mph when he overtook the taxi. As he did, Anderson crashed into the Richards car. When passers-by saw the collision and rushed over to help, they saw Anderson slumped over the steering well, and it was clear both Mr and Mrs Richards were seriously hurt, prosecutor Charlotte Crangle told the court on Monday. They were both taken to hospital, but Mr Richards first had to be cut out of his car.  Mrs Richards, from Flixton, Greater Manchester, was pronounced dead just before pm. Mr Richards is still in hospital, having suffered fractures to both arms, his shoulder and his neck as well as a serious brain injury. He is currently in a rehabilitation ward, and will have to move into assisted living when he is expected to be discharged in December or January due to his medical needs. It is expected he will suffer long-term cognitive and physical deficiencies. The tragedy was the latest to befall the Richards family, with John and Pamelas eldest daughter dying shortly before the crash after developing breast cancer. The court was told that Mrs Richards worked at Woolworths and was a childminder. Mr Richards was an educational welfare officer well-known for his work with young people, and had been a governor at Kings Road Primary School in Stretford. Anderson originally denied the offence and said someone  was driving the car, but later pleaded guilty. Sentencing Anderson, Judge Walsh said: The collision was caused by the dangerous way in which you drove your vehicle which was further aggravated by your grossly intoxicated condition. The sentence that I am required to pass cannot, and is not intended to reflect the value of the lives which have been lost and shattered by your actions. The grief, pain and loss experienced by the family and friends of Pamela and John Richards is enduring. The pre-sentence report indicated that you have expressed remorse for your conduct and I accept this is genuine. Putting to one side the issue of alcohol and speed, the execution of the overtaking manoeuvre alone was dangerous. Anderson must serve half of his sentence before being considered for parole. He was also disqualied from driving for a period of ten years and ten months and will be required to take an extended re-test.

I love his smile and his laugh, its still my favourite thing today and his beautul blue eyes. Bruce says that he was first amazed by my beautul smile and he loved my passion for le and animals. What got him was my ability to be honest in any situation and it truly blew him away even when I was in the wrong. At first my mum and dad were judgemental about it, for like a week, but they saw how happy he truly made me and how he treated me and how playful and lovey we are so they quickly changed their minds. My whole family has never been rude or judgemental to him or us, which I am so thankful for.  Bruces mum, step dad, dad, and step mum and his cousin have all been wonderful to me and open armed. The relationship was a bit rocky with his brother, but weve noticed they are finally coming around slowly but surely. Sadly, Bruces three daughters from his previous marriage choose not to be in his le at all since they found out he was dating me. Busy planning their wedding, the couple arent sure about children just yet as Marissa wants to finish her nursing training but is aware that Bruce isnt getting any younger. Finally, Marissa hit back at people who dont understand her relationship and laughs off strangers who mistake them for father and daughter.  We actually just picked our wedding day and plan to get hitched next year, she said. Kids Im still on the fence about, I feel Im not ready for kids now, I want my degree and have a nice savings built, but Bruce isnt going to get any younger. So, Im not sure whats going to happen with kiddos, she said. To those who dont understand the relationship, this answer changes with what they have an issue with. If someone is weirded out by the age gap I just tell them Im an old soul and Bruce is a young soul. I dont feel an age gap, I only see it. Im not a gold digger by any means, I dont have daddy issues, and the relationship is not strictly intimate or anything of that sort.

Officials swooped on Hadrians Camp, a homeless and travellers site near Carlisle, after a tip-off about a man being kept in squalid conditions. Cumbria Police found a  year-old with learning dficulties living in the damp shed in conditions that no human being should live in. Officers have said they are investigating an incident of modern slavery. But devastated relatives of the OAP who has been arrested for allegedly keeping the man in his shed have claimed he took him in out of friendship. The man was said to be like a rabbit in the headlights when found in the shed on Wednesday and is now being medically assessed. Officers arrested a frail homeowner, , in a house next door on suspicion of modern slavery offences, although hes too poorly yet to be interviewed. But now relatives claimed the kind-hearted pensioner took the man in and offered him a place in the house - but claimed he preferred the shed. The relative, who asked not to be named, claimed: Hes a free man. Hes had everything given to him but this is how he chooses to live. My relatives home is right next door to the shed, and hes told the man hes free to go into his home any time he wants. Hes said he can sleep on the sofa, but he wont do it. This man is free to come and go as he pleases.  It is feared the man was living in the shed, working for food and shelter, since he was aged  or . Cumbria Police - who coordinated the raid alongside the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority- are now investigating. Detective Chief Inspector Helen Harkins said: Our officers assisted the GLAA as part of their investigation into an incident of modern slavery in Carlisle. We would like to stress that anyone of any race or background could be a victim of modern day slavery. Offenders tend to target people who are vulnerable and isolated. We often rely on the public for valuable information and evidence when investigating these type of crimes. Hidden signs make it dficult to identy a victim, but common indications include poor physical appearance, isolation, poor living conditions, few or no personal effects, restricted freedom of movement, unusual travel times and a reluctance to seek help. I would urge people to take the time to learn the signs and get in touchyou have any suspicions that something is not quite right. The GLAA have claimed the conditions the man was allegedly forced to sleep in as those that no human being should live in. They are a government department who monitor the supply of workers to the agricultural, horticultural and shellfish industries. They work in partnership with other agencies to protect vulnerable and exploited workers and crack down on modern slavery.

Andrew Jordan has put his le on hold and vowed to stop at nothing to reveal the truth behind the murder of his angel Liga Skromane. The -year-olds headless body was found by a local fisherman in a swampy mangrove forest close to where she was last seen at a popular tourist beach in India. Liga had been missing for  days after travelling to a wellness retreat in the Indian state of Kerala with her sister to seek treatment for PTSD. She vanished while on a trip to get cigarettes and was last seen in a rickshaw heading to the beach on March  this year. A police investigation led to the arrest of two men who were charged with first-degree murder and rape but they have since been released on bail while a trial date is set.  Police say they confessed to meeting Liga on the beach before they lured her to the mangrove to smoke marijuana. They said that she passed out and they then repeatedly raped her. When she woke up they said they accidentally strangled her while trying to restrain her and strung her body up on the tree to make it look like suicide. But Andrew has serious concerns about the veracity of the confession and believes there are gaping holes with the theory. The haunting memory of Ligas body forever etched in his mind drives his search for the truth as he pours over hours of police documents and evidence looking for clues. The home they shared for five years is piled high with papers and news-clippings from the case and post-it notes, scribbled with stubborn questions, are stuck to the computer screen and the walls. Andrew said: “Every spare minute Im working on the case, sending emails and writing everything down, trying to piece it all together. “I think about it constantly and some questions just wont go away.  “Someone knows something over there but I have no faith in the Indian police or the justice system to find them. “My focus now is on sending out a shock wave in the international community by writing a book or making a film. “I cant let it rest. There are other victims who have disappeared or been murdered in India who have never got justice. The cases are dragged out for so many years that the families get worn down and dont have the energy or the money to fight anymore. And therell be hundreds more unless things change,” Andrew said. “I feel like Im an investigator investigating a murder with no support which happened thousands of miles away. “I have people in India updating me on whats happening on the ground there via WhatsApp everyday. “And Ive been taking extra work to make as much money as quickly as I can to get back out there so the police know Im still there breathing down their necks.”  One of the questions Andrew has about the case involves the designer Italian woollen jumper Liga was wearing when he identied her body on April . He believes that this jumper is a vital clue and one which undermines the police theory about Ligas death. He said: It was over c. You dont even need a jumper there at night. The only place you would need one there would be in a cold cellar or a fridge. The two men they arrested for her murder said that they were raping her all day but one of them then went home and got her a jumper - an expensive Italian designer jumper - when she said she was cold. If youre raping someone I think its unlikely you suddenly start caring about their temperature. Andrew has also identied problems with the official theory that Liga was killed the day she disappeared. He showed photos of the body to independent forensic scientists who told him Ligas remains were not sufficiently decomposed for her to have died where her body was found  days earlier. Andrew said: I was told that the state of decomposition looked like she had been dead for  -  days,  days at the very most.  “A forensic scientist told me thata body was left in that environment for  days, it would be in a worse state.It’s like her body had been kept in a very dry, cold place which prevented it from decomposing further. “So she must have been moved to that mangrove swamp not long before she was found. “Andshe had been there for weeks she would have been found much sooner. That area is not as isolated as police pretend. People go there to forage and to drink alcohol and take drugs. There’s a well worn path through the area and there’s a house about m away. “Someone would have seen her or someone would have smelt the bodyit really had been there for  days.”  Andrew also believes that Ligas injuries, confirmed in an autopsy, also cast doubt over the official theory that she was accidentally strangled. He said: She suffered blunt force trauma to her neck which was given as her cause of death. It tore the nerves and fractured thyroid cartilage. The severity of the injury is not consistent with the claim that she was accidentally strangled by an arm around her neck as she was being restrained. Ten of her teeth were also missing. If these teeth fell out after death as the police investigation suggests, they would have been easily recovered near her body. And the two men they have barely speak English. Theres no way she would have wilfully spent the day with them. She hated drugs and Liga was hugely considerate, she would not have disappeared for the day knowing it would worry her sister. Manoj Abraham, the Inspector General of Police in Thiruvanthapuram Range, the area where Ligas body was found, has confirmed that they will not be calling for the CBI to join the investigation. Mr Abraham said: The High Court after detailed study of the case files agreed that the investigation has been conducted on correct lines and so the case has been dismissed.  We will be charge sheeting the case in the next seven to ten days and then it is for the court to take up the trial of the case. Andrew said that he is disappointed but not surprised by the verdict. “I have no confidence in the police.Now the two guys charged have been released on bail awaiting trial. “I’d like to believe she was not suffering for long, being held prisoner somewhere before her death but I still dont know what happened to her. Now, all alone in the home they once shared, Andrew is haunted by thoughts of her final moments. Wandering around his bedroom in a daze, surrounded by Ligas clothes and books, Andrew is now trying to plot the next stage in his fight for justice. “I want to protect other girls from Liga’s fate. If lessons are not learned and the guilty are not held accountable there will be another Liga. If I can do anything there I’d like to help protect women from sexual and domestic violence. There is so little protection for them. “If I find out the truth I’ll be happy not to have to imagine what happened to her anymore, he said.

The demand for commercial sex in the UK has been estimated more thoroughly than ever before in an analysis of more than , British men aged  to . It claims  per cent use prostitutes - well above the one in ten calculated by earlier studies. And researchers found men who paid for sex have on average  sexual partners - two-and-a-half times more than the . partners for those who do not. Study lead author Dr Marilena Locatelli, an economist at the University of Turin in Italy, said: There are more managers, professionals and skilled workers paying for sex. This is not the case for elementary occupation.  She said this was a surprise, since such men may have more to loseit becomes known they have paid for sex. Dr Locatelli said: Second, belonging to a religion has a signicant and negative effect on the probability of not having sex with a prostitute. Again, this result is contrary to our expectation. She added: An unexpected finding is that the expected number of times with prostitutes is higher among those who declare that they are religious. The findings, published in the Scottish Journal of Political Economy, are based on a mathematical model using information from the National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lestyles. It included  participants who said they had been with prostitutes, and , who said they had not.  Dr Locatelli and co author Dr Steinar Strom, of the University of Oslo in Norway, said there is no other similar comprehensive study of its kind. The expected number of times with prostitutes was much higher among men travelling abroad, living in London and middle rather than high or low earners. Dr Locatelli said: It could be the lower income men cannot afford having sex with prostitutes and the rich men may have too much reputation to losethey are caught being with prostitutes. Worryingly, drug users and men who do not use condoms are also more likely to have sex with prostitutes, exposing them to health risks. The researchers said from a policy point of view, it was interesting to note that the men are less likely to use prostitutesthey had an extensive sex education, which is still not compulsory in schools.  Dr Locatelli said: To require that sex education at school should be compulsory in all schools could therefore help in reducing prostitution in Britain. Moreover, we find that drugs users, and men declaring that they are religious, are more inclined to participate in the sex market. We find a strong and signicant association between buying sex and being abroad and with living in London. We find that men with medium and medium–high income, which indicates a middle class background, are more likely than other men to participate in the sex market. This ranged from pound, to pound, a year.

Newham Council has evacuated two primary and two secondary schools to treat the invasion of  widow spiders immediately before the eggs start hatching. Thousands of kids in the east London borough stayed home while pest control experts scoured the schools in a bid to curb the killer menace. False Widow Spiders, the UKs most poisonous arachnid, are dark-coloured with globular bodies and range from . to  mm in size. Although named because of its physical similarity to the killer black widow spider, the species bites rarely cause death but can be very painful.  Symptoms include severe pain radiating from the bite and fever - but could prove fatala young and vulnerable child was bitten in an especially sensitive location. Four schools in the east London borough are facing weeks without lessons, including Lister Community School, Star Primary, Ellen Wilkinson Primary and Rokeby Secondary School. Headteacher at Star Primary, Lisle Von Buchenroder, said the school was forced to close so pest control can exterminate the eggs before they start hatching. In a letter to parents Wednesday she said: I am writing to update you regarding the current school closure. It was with much regret that I had to make the decision to close the school yesterday as the safety and well-being of pupils and staff is always our number one priority. I was made aware of an infestation of noble  black widow spiders which was discovered during a routine check by Newham’s Environmental Team. They believe that the infestation is contained to the outside of the building and that this needs to be treated immediately before the eggs start hatching. I want to reassure all members of our community that these are precautionary measures and that we are very lucky to have found out in time to take action to remove them. After speaking to the Environmental Team this morning, I do regretfully have to inform you that I am advised the school treatment plan will happen in two phases, starting tomorrow.

Kayleigh Henning suffered from bloating, constipation and agonising abdominal cramps for more than  years. Her condition was so bad she could only go to the toilet once a week. Sleepless nights were spent curled up on the bathroom floor in agony while multiple doctors failed to correctly diagnose her problem. Kayleigh said: It was so annoying because everyone just assumed I was pregnant and wouldnt leave that alone - I was definitely not pregnant! Id wear tights or anything like that which normally fit me for the whole day. By the end of the day, Id be very uncomfortable and Id have pressure marks from my trousers or tights imprinted on my skin.  “It was pretty painful, which affects you mentally. You feel like you just dont want to go out anywhere. Id often find Id experience diarrhoea on nights out and that is obviously pretty embarrassing. So many times I wouldnt feel like going out. Because I was constipated, Id be going to the toilet only once a week. That in itself is disconcerting because youre thinking in the back of your head why havent I been to the toilet . I probably endured the problems all through my s, even at university. Id been to see my GP mainly because of constipation problems and Id get given fibre gel drinks, she says. Kayleighs situation came to a head when she graduated from Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh, and moved from Scotland to Northern Ireland that week.  “The stress of that culminated in my first visit to AE. I was really worried I wouldnt be able to fly back for the graduation ceremony because I was in so much pain. I was just curled up on the bathroom floor, because it was cold and the best place to be.” Tiredness and depression, caused by her painful and irritable symptoms, had became part of daily le for the then -year-old.  Doctors put the symptoms down to Irritable Bowel Syndromeand prescribed a drug they thought would help. Kayleigh went home and had her first nights sleep in - days, but she developed an allergic reaction to the drug and had to rush back to AE. On most occasions [at the GP] I dont know whether it was ignorance or easiness, I always got these fibre gel drinks which I used for quite a while until another GP told me to come off them because they were not a long-term solution. But then Kayleighs personal trainer mentioned food intolerances and said she could fast-track an elimination diet with a test which analyses IgG antibody reactionsto up to  food and drink ingredients provided by the company YorkTest . Kayleigh said: My trainer was intolerant to a few things and didnt know until she took the test. Since she has eliminated those things from her diet, she has felt so much better.” Kayleighs husband, Robert, has ME [chronic fatigue syndrome] and was also going through a rough time but couldnt understand why. Kayleigh says: Hes had a few allergy tests, but never any intolerance tests. He had already eliminated gluten and cows milk from his diet. His lunch consisted of a chicken breast, potatoes and an egg every day.  “Interestingly when he took the intolerance test, which I got for him as a Christmas present, he found he was intolerant to eggs! So as soon as he eliminated the eggs he felt better as well.” Although Robert had around  intolerances, from eggs to raspberries, the message from specialists was not to panic - and even that some intolerances can be reintroduced six months after eliminating them from a diet. Kayleighs test - the YorkTest FoodDrink Scan programme - also threw up several surprises, revealing she had reactions to cow’s milk, egg white, lentils, yeast, buckwheat and gluten. “I’m not surprised by cow’s milk or gluten and avoided them as much as possible, because I knew that they didnt agree with me. I was surprised by lentils - I loved making lentil soup and sweet potato and lentil stew - and of course lentils are seen as healthy,” she says. My borderline list had things like walnut, rhubarb and avocado, which I ate all the time as well. What the experts advise is to eliminate everything over a period of six months then you can start to reintroduce things. We dont necessarily do that, but we can enjoy things on occasions and not suffer because were not eating them every day. The test involves sending a finger-prick blood sample to a laboratory for analysis followed by up to two consultations with a nutritional therapist.  Kayleigh says: “I found the nutritional consultation very helpful. Particularly when it came to finding alternatives, especially for garlic! “She was able to provide much more specic information on what to avoid based on food groups and gave some great alternatives and recipes,” she says. As soon as Kayleigh started her elimination diet, she immediately felt better. “As I had already removed gluten, wheat and cow’s milk from my diet, I found it relatively easy to remove the remaining foods. The one I found most dficult was yeast. “I definitely feel much better, and I know when I have eaten something that I am intolerant to immediately. I havent been constipated since, I bloat much less, and I don’t experience the same stomach cramps, provided I steer clear of my trigger foods. I do eat the odd food I probably shouldnt, but at least I know the reason for any discomfort. I am so much happier, consistently comfortable and have regular bowel movements, too.

That was one year ago, now she’s sold thousands of products in her own, mainly monochrome, designs and is planning to expand into wholesale supply and take on staff. She said: “It’s all pinks and blues for kids on the high street, I didn’t realise how common it is many parents want to dress their children in unisex. “Everyone takes a dferent line on it now.”  But it was only once she started selling personalised designs that things started to take off. “Once I got the idea out there, it took a couple of weeks for people to start looking at it,” Emily added. “I introduced personalised stuff - and as soon as I brought that out people just jumped on it. “I was working from my kitchen, but I’ve moved into a bedroom now.” Her latest design - tops sporting the logo Future Changer - is another take on personalisation.  “People have the option to add whatever they want, so my son’s says ‘Future Paleontologist’ because that’s all he ever talks about. “I thought ‘why not have what children aspire to be when they’re older  I’m donating % of the sales to World Vision UK, a charity that helps children create their own futures. “And I wanted something you couldn’t get on the high street. “I never expected this, my friends say ‘we just can’t believe how it’s taken off’ - but when I’m sat crying on my office floor because I’m so tired, I don’t really think about it. “Some nights I don’t get to bed till am, then I get up for the school run, but it just works. “And my partner, Joey’s dad, helps me a lot with day-to-day stuff like school drop-offs and bed times.” "},{"url":null,"title":"five cruel words pregnant employee","story":"NewsFive cruel words pregnant employee claims boss said to her before she was firedAn Avon employee claims she was fired from the company just days after revealing her high-risk pregnancyShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsA pregnant woman is currently involved in a lawsuit with her former company after she was fired suddenly\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Caroline Ruiz was just starting her fourth week working as global head of North America procurement at beauty company Avon, when she was suddenly fired.At the time of the incident, Ruiz says she was expecting a baby and had just been rushed to hospital after experiencing heavy bleeding.Doctors are said to have given the mum-to-be some devastating news - she had a high-risk pregnancy, meaning there was an exceedingly high likelihood she would suffer a miscarriage.Ruiz claims medical experts advised her to take time off of work and stay on bed rest, but having just started her new job she was reluctant to do so. So the following week she ed to Avons Manhattan-based office, but it ended up being a huge mistake.  Ruiz, who is currently involved in a lawsuit with the cosmetics giant, claims that the day after her , she was confronted by her boss, Raj Nath and a HR representative, over unspecied performance issues. She says she explained her diagnosis and askedshe could work from home for one week. According to court documents filed on October , Nath allegedly responded by saying five rather cruel words: “Your health isnt my concern. He is said to have added: But your performance is.  Following this, Ruiz says she received an email informing her that her request to work remotely had been denied, so she spent the weekend preparing for a big presentation as she was determined to do an excellent job.But according to the court documents, when she got to work on Monday, things took a turn for the worse as she was called into a meeting and fired for performance deficiencies. Ruiz is said to have responded that she believed she was being fired because she was pregnant, particularly given that she had worked at Avon for less than four weeks, and had not been given a fair chance to perform. In a statement for Jezebel, Jeanne Christensen of Wigdor LLP, the lead attorney on Ruizs case, said Avon abhorrently fired our client simply because she disclosed her pregnancy.

In total, she claims she makes around ,a year in donations and business created by her Instagram page. Gweneth, a former commercial model, said: “I never really noticed the foot fetish thing until the social media wave came along.  “I would always post pictures of my feet by the pool and it got a huge following, she continued. “I ended up creating a new Instagram just for people who love my feet. “I have some men who will pay me to massage my feet for an hour.

Doctors told his -year-old mum Isabela Gillado her baby was unlikely to survive past two weeks during her first ultasound in July last year.But after a long fight and contrary to the prognosis, Matthew is celebrating his first birthday on October . The rare congenital disorder means the flat bones in the cranial vault within the skull are either completely or partially absent.  Raven said: We wanted to feel the physical presence of our baby, hug and kiss him. We named him Matthew as it means a gt from God. During the first month of Isabella’s pregnancy, she had a fever and took bioflu, an over-the-counter capsule containing phenylephrine HCI, chlorphenamine maleate and paracetamol, for one week. They believe this may have had some impact on the baby’s facial deformation. Matthew was born via cesarean section in a hospital in Santiago town in northern Philippines.  He said: When I first saw our baby, I trembled, felt weak and almost collapsed inside the delivery room. He was almost faceless. The next day, despite his condition, baby Matthew was discharged while Isabela was left at the intensive care unit for two weeks. Isabela continues to feed him drops of milk and vitamins for him to stay healthy and he is now celebrating his first birthday on October .

The Malaysia Airlines flight vanished with almost  passengers and crew as it flew from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March . It remains one of aviations biggest mysteries, with few pieces of debris found and the exact reason it went off course still unknown.  In their official report, Malaysian officials concluded that they were unable to determine the real cause of the Boeing -s disappearance. British aviation expert Don Thompson and fellow specialist Mike Exner, from the US,have accused Malaysia of failing to faithfully and diligently pursue the investigation. They claim the probe “was heavily politically influenced, and delayed”, and have called on the countrys leaders to reveal more about what they havent told the public.In an interview with the West Australian, the pair, from the Independent Groupof experts, explained eight areas where Malaysia needs to do more or reveal more information.. New radar data analysis  Mr Thompson and Mr Exner say the most important step would be a new analysis of radar data for the missing plane. They said: “The Safety Investigation Team has failed to provide any useful analysis of data from the military radar. “It is important to establish , when and where descents climbs did occur and what impact that would have on fuel endurance and other implications. “Of course, there are the somewhat incredible statements about Indonesian and Royal Thai Air Defence Surveillance radar assets not detecting the Boeing  in the northern Straits of Malacca.” . Complete analysis of debris  The experts have called for a complete “structural analysis of the most signicant debris items” that have been found in the sea or on islands in the Indian Ocean. Underwater searches ended with no traces of the plane. But debris that has washed up includes a flap and flaperon from one of the aircrafts wings. The experts want a closer look to be taken at the damage to the parts. . Recovery of all debris found so far  The debris that has been found so far in Indian Ocean territories hasnt been collected and stored in one place. Madagascar has a piece of the engine in its possession, while other parts were found on the French island of Reunion and the coast of Tanzania, for example. The experts say the debris should be taken to one place so it can be examined all at once for further clues. . Comprehensive oceanographic analysis This would take a look at the drt modelling for each of the debris items before they were found. Mr Thompson and Mr Exner believe there is plenty more work to be done in this area. The exact location where the plane entered the ocean is still not clear. . Review of what happened at MAS HQ  The immediate response of state-owned Malaysia Airlines and the government have been under intense scrutiny in the years following the disappearance. Mr Thompson and Mr Exner say there should be an investigation into what happened inside the airlines operational dispatch centre. The review should look at why the flight operations officer flight dispatcher was so misinformed for such a period of time, they said. . Analysis of air audio recordings Air traffic control ground-air recordings usually offer many clues or explanations in an aviation disaster. The experts have called for a categorical attributing of the ATC ground-air recordings involving MH. They want the voices in the recordings to be identied as there is still some contention over the crew member speaking during radio transmissions. .

Marie-Claire Bissonnete was protesting peacefully when the assault took place in Toronto, Canada. The -year-old accused the man, identied by his former boss as hairdresser Jordan Hunt, of vandalising activists signs and clothing with permanent marker pens. According to Miss Bissonnette, he then became aggressive and a debate took place. In footage captured by the pro-le campaigner, Mr Hunt says: If somebody gets raped by somebody and theyre like Im a -year-old and I cant have this baby, think you should keep it  She replies: Its a baby, and says an abortion would be killing. Mr Hunt then kicks Miss Bissonnette in the shoulder.  He can be heard telling shocked bystanders he was aiming for her phone, which was knocked to the floor. Toronto Police Service confirmed it is investigating. In a statement on Instagram , Mr Hunts former employer Noble Studio  said: It has been brought to our attention that Jordan Hunt has been caught on camera assaulting an innocent bystander at a pro-le rally. We dont condone his actions and he has been let go. We believe that everyone has a right to an opinion and the right to voice their opinion without fear of physical violence.  In a statement, Miss Bissonnette said the assault was not the first time she has been hurt at a rally. Rocks have been thrown at me, Ive been spat upon multiple times and pushed, she said. Men have aggressively asked how I would like itthey raped me and forced me to have an abortion. There is a media-driven narrative that pro-le activists are violent and a danger to women. This is a bald-faced lie. The only violence or aggression Ive witnessed in my many years in the pro-le movement comes entirely from pro-abortion activists, and yet its rarely,ever, reported.

Anatoly Moskvin dug up the mummied the girls who were all aged between three and -years-old. The -year-old even dressed them in knee- boots, stockings and clothes, before putting make-up on their faces. He also wedged music boxes inside their rib cages. Journalist Moskvin was caught some six years ago as he was the main suspect for vandalising Muslim cemeteries in the city of Nizhny Novgorod in western Russia.  But when the cops entered his flat, where he lived with his parents, they were shocked to find  mummied dolls of the dead little girls. He reportedly spent almost a decade living with some of the corpses, with the families of the girls not realising the coffins of their children had been empty for a long time. He has confessed to  counts of digging up the graves and abusing the little girls in them and later told police that he was in fact waiting for science to find ways of resuscitating them. He has spent the last five of years in a mental hospital where he was receiving mandatory treatment but his doctors are now said to believe Moskvin is ready to go home. The medical experts are reportedly convinced he is no longer dangerous. Another medical exam is reportedly due to take place and the next court hearing on Moskvins case is scheduled for October .  Ten-year-old Olga Chardymovas body was one the girls stolen from what was supposed to be her final resting place. Olgas mother, Natalia Chardymova, , is outraged at the official request made to release the evil man from his secure psychiatric hospital. Natalia - who now has a son aged nine - said she was appalled that Moskvin could be freed. “This creature brought fear, terror and panic into my ,” she said. “I shudder to think that he will have freedom to go where he wants.” He had warned the court that ‘I willto my girls’,he was ever freed, she said. But this now seems forgotten. “Neither my family nor the families of the other victims will be able to sleep peacefully. “He needs to be kept under surveillance. “I insist on a le sentence….only under medical supervision, without the right of free movement.  “Years have passed but my attitude to Moskvin has not changed at all - horror, fear and panic. “Hell cause a lot more suffering to someone ….” Natalia said she feels “shock, horror and fear - even my voice trembles now as I speak.” She said: “These are my fears, my worries… I don’t want repetition of what happened in the past. “It was very scary.” However, it is believed the court is unlikely to seek the views of bereaved parents. “He deprived me of the right to visit my daughter, to visit her grave: as it turned out, for years I visited an empty coffin,” she added. Little Olga was murdered in . She had begged her mother to be allowed to walk on her own to her granny’s flat in the next apartment block. Im ten already. I can go myself, she pleaded. Natalia relented and Olga went out with her favourite green bag and blue umbrella, never to be seen alive again. A drug addict waiting in the lobby of her block had forced her back up to the top floor, and robbed her of her earrings, and because she tried to escape, cracked her over the head with a metal bar. Despite searches for her body, Olgas remains with the umbrella and bag were not found for five months wedged behind pipes in the blocks attic. We buried her on  October , Natalia said.  “I could never imagine that almost exactly ten years later, on the  October , I would open her grave with the police, and find her remains had vanished. Her coffin was empty, with a hole at the top from which he had pulled the remains. You cant begin to imagine it, that somebody would touch the grave of your child, the most holy place in this world for you.” She added: My girl had been murdered,anyone deserved to rest in peace, she did, but instead her grave had been robbed.” I still find it hard to grasp the scale of his sickening ‘work’ but for nine years he was living with my mummied daughter in his bedroom. I had her for ten years, he had her for nine.” Moskvin’s mother Elvira, then , told police after he was arrested: We saw these dolls but we did not suspect there were dead bodies inside. We thought it was his hobby to make such big dolls and did not see anything wrong with it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"teen didnt know pregnant until","story":"NewsTeen didnt know she was pregnant until she was giving birth on kitchen floorMilaois Murphys mum Victoria thought she had appendicitis until she went into labour and her waters brokeShareCommentsByLynne KelleherChris kitching:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsMum Malois Murphy with her partner James Mulligan and baby Harper \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenager didnt know she was pregnant until she gave birth on her kitchen floor to her tiny daughter weighing just a pound. Milaois Murphys mum Victoria thought she had appendicitis until she went into labour and her waters broke. The -year-olds baby girl, Harper, arrived at just  weeks as an ambulance was en route to her Dublin home in the middle of the night. Milaois told the Irish Mirror that the baby literally slid out into my trousers - and hailed her mum actions in resuscitating the newborn as heroic.  The teen said: “She was born on the kitchen floor. “When she came out she let out a little cry and then she stopped breathing so me Ma had to resuscitate her. “The baby was only the same size as her hand. She was just a pound .If it wasn’t for her, she is a super Mammy. I think the ambulance men were telling her how to do it.  “The ambulance and the fire brigade were just amazing. They did kind of scare me a little bit when they said they had to put the baby in a plastic bag to keep her warm. “At that time, I didn’t even know what I had. I had so much adrenaline going around my body, I didn’t feel pain anymore.” Milaois had been getting sick all that night but had no idea she was pregnant. She said: “I had back pain and I couldn’t sleep but that was my only symptom. I thought I was getting a bit chubby. “The baby could have been kicking but I didn’t know because I never had a baby and I thought it could be wind or something.  “That night, I was vomiting and vomiting and I said, ‘Ma, I need to go to the hospital’. We thought it was my appendix and we rang the Mater at about  o’clock. “Within seconds I felt pressure and my waters broke everywhere. “Me Ma knew straight away and told me to relax and called my sister and the baby literally slid out into my trousers. She was born on my kitchen floor. I was brought to the Rotunda. “I was so numb with the shock it didn’t click with me until the next morning that I had a baby. “Then I went up and I saw her and the mother instinct immediately kicked in. Then I rang her father and we went up and picked her name.”  RTE series, The Rotunda, airing on Thursday at .pm, catalogues the long and dficult road for baby Harper who was in intensive care for months. Consultant Neonatologist Adrienne Foran said the arrival of the baby at one pound and  ounces was a huge shock to Milaois and her partner James Mulligan. She added: “Harper was smaller than a bag of sugar. She was about  minutes old when I met her, she had come in with no heart rate but responded well to initial resuscitation. “We had to ask Milaois after having that big shock to express her own breast milk which was the best thing for the baby.That’s an awful lot to ask a girl who five or six hours earlier went to bed with not a care in the world to find out she was in labour, had a baby she wasn’t expecting who is potentially very sick, very premature.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/07/image.jpg@1.90694.jpg ","title":"dundee united fans to have chance to meet league winning stars","story":"Dundee United fans will have the chance to meet heroes from the  league-winning at a special night being held in the city.Whitehall Theatre will host ‘An Evening With The Tangerine Terrors’ on Saturday November  to celebrate the th anniversary of their achievement.Former players including John Holt, Maurice Malpas, Paul Hegarty, Hamish McAlpine, Eamonn Bannon, John Reilly, Davie Dodds and Paul Sturrock will be there on the night.The former teammates will be brought back together for a night of stories and memories from from the unforgettable season # which climaxed by clinching the league title at Dens Park in a - win over Dundee.The show will have an added bit of interest as it will be hosted by Keith Haggart who is the grandson of George Fox # the former long-serving club director.Tickets can be secured on Friday via dundeebox"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb486cb67878-488x564.jpg ","title":"embarrassed freddy frans confident dundee united can recover","story":"Dundee United defender Freddy Frans admits he felt embarrassed to have led the side during their - home defeat at the hands of Ross County which, ultimately, spelled the end for Csaba Laszlo.Frans captained the side on the day as Csaba was relieved of his duties as manager in the wake of the Tannadice hammering.His No  Laurie Ellis has taken interim charge and will likely be in the dugout as United travel to Somerset Park to face league leaders Ayr United on Saturday.And, although he is still hurting after the County calamity, Belgian centre-back Frans believes they can bounce back straight away.“People should look at themselves, we don’t need to talk about somebody , we don’t need to talk about the manager or other players,” he said.“We need to look at our own performances and I feel embarrassed.“Especially in an important game like this against one of our title rivals. I can’t remember getting beaten like this.“At half-time there was a lot of emotion, we were trying to get things straight and after the game we’re angry but what can you say  We need to look at ourselves.“It’s easy to look at others and pass the blame on but there is no use in doing that.“We need to stick together.“You always have to be confident, it’s stupid as a football player to think you can’t turn it around. You have to stay positive.“Even though it’s hard to take we have to take it on the chin and go again this weekend.”The -year-old was at a loss to explain what went wrong on Saturday as a Billy Mckay hat-trick and goals from Sean Kelly and Joshua Mullin did the damage for a United side that could only muster one of their own through Pavol Safranko on  minutes.What Frans did accept though, was they need to improvethey want to get the better of the likes of Ross County and others now above them in the race for the Championship title.The Terrors lie in fourth, five points behind leaders Ayr and Frans feels they can learn a thing or two from their promotion rivals.“Sometimes it’s hard to explain in football, you get so much confidence and then this happens. It comes from nowhere,” he added.“I think we started really well. We had a great chance at the beginning and, obviously, we miss it. We concede a stupid goal on a set-piece where we need to be smarter.“We get back into the game with a great goal and, in that moment, I thought we were OK but again we concede a stupid goal again with a cross from the side.“Even then at - it’s bad but I thought ‘look we’ve got  minutes to turn it round’ and then we concede quite early.“The red card for Stewart Murdoch finished it. It’s easy to blame it on mentality but with the goals we conceded it’s about quality as well.“It’s about being smart. That’s what theydid better on Saturday, they were more dirty, more street-wise and we’re too nice.“I can’t blame boys, especially during the week in training, for effort because we train really hard butyou see the game on Saturday it’s logical for the first thing people question to be mentality.“You can run as much as you want butyou don’t do the basics and take a hold of the ball,you don’t pick up your man, simple things like that you’ll lose the game.”Frans apologised to fans, saying: “There’s not much we can say to the supporters, just sorry.

Over the coming five days she will ping-pong between islands at the very northern fringes of British Isles, stopping for a few hours here and there to meet Royal Bank of Scotland customers and deliver their banking needs.Over the course of a typical week, Anne – the UK’s only full-time “flying banker” – will hop on one of Loganair’s eight-seater Britten-Norman Islander flights at least nine times, to take her unique services to the most remote areas of the country.“I don’t think of the journeys in terms of miles,” she says, eyes scanning the skies for the arrival of her morning flight, taking her the short journey from North Ronaldsay to Papa Westray in a mere eight minutes.“The distances between the islands are short, so getting from place to place doesn’t take too long.”Indeed, Anne’s shortest trip is the briefest flight in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records. The . mile distance between Westray and Papa Westray officially takes two minutes, butthe wind blows in their favour, Anne’s flight touches down in  seconds.Anne has been doing the job for  years and notched up , flights, bringing a vital banking service to customers living and working in the country’s most distant locations.“Customers are very grateful that I keep coming out to see them in their own communities,” says Anne, . “I’ve been able to get to know people well and help them face to face with their banking needs.“I’ve been doing it for so long, that I now see people’s children and their grandchildren too!”A typical week sees Anne dart between a chain of northerly islands. On a Monday she heads to Longhope on South Walls via ferry, flies from Kirkwall Airport to Stronsay on Tuesday, Westray on Wednesday and Sanday on Thursday before finishing off the week on the mainland at Orkney’s Stromness.Today’s jaunt to North Ronaldsay and Papa Westray is her ‘once a month’ drop in, to help locals with deposits, withdrawals, and banking support – from delivering foreign currency to offering help with online services.On each island she serves around  to  customers, from crofters to fishermen, plus those serving the tourist industry by running BBs.“The service has changed a little over the years thanks to the onset of online and phone banking,” says Anne. “But it’s important for customers to receive the ‘personal touch’.“They can come to me and pay in some cash or withdraw some, and I can give them change, advice and answer any queries.“I really enjoy having this personal link with customers, and they really appreciate the service.”The job has its perks too, she adds. “I regularly look out of each of the island bank office windows to see a family of seals playing in the waves, or stretched out sunbathing on the beach, something that is special and unique to the mobility of my role.”The flying banker role was launched in  by Mary Muir, who did the job for almost  years before handing over to Anne in .It seemed almost right that she took on the role – years earlier her great-uncle skippered the island’s floating bank service, taking the teller from port to port to carry out his duties.Anne’s work in helping islanders bank led to her receiving an MBE in , and more recently she received a specially engraved glass plaque commemorating her many flights, from Loganair pilot Colin McAllister.“I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the last  years hopping across the islands,” she adds. “Every day is dferent and the views on my daily commute never get old.“It really is a privilege to be the UK’s only flying banker and take a commute like this to work each day and help so many people and communities.”The flying banker service is just one of many ways Royal Bank is meeting the needs of its customers. The bank has appointed a team of Community Bankers who travel to towns and villages across the country, bringing banking services to libraries, coffee shops and community centres.Royal Bank are committed to bringing banking services, support and advice to people who might not otherwise be able to reach a branch – its  mobile branches stop off in dozens of rural locations every day.It’s all in addition to the bank’s market leading app, online service and many other ways to bank."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/5bb347afa49c4-e1538477058288.jpg ","title":"give laurie ellis the managers job permanently says dundee united legend john holt","story":"Tangerine legend John Holt believes the Dundee United board do not have to leave Tannadice to find the perfect successor to Csaba Laszlo.The man who won the Premier League and two League Cups with United believes caretaker boss Laurie Ellis is the man to take over on a permanent basis.John remains a regular at home matches through his work in the Tannadice hospitality lounges and was sad to see Csaba sacked but believes after a dficult start to the season that the - weekend loss to Ross County made his departure inevitable.“You never like to see a manager sacked and I feel sorry for Csaba, I really do, but it’s been clear for a while now things haven’t been working.“Saturday was another bad home defeat and, for any manager,the team isn’t performing in front of their own fans it’s a big problem.“After the fourth goal I’d say between , and , fans just got up and left.

Hamilton will have said, ‘get a goal against them and they’re dead’ but the players were well fired up on Saturday, I didn’t have to do anything.“When the goal goes in from Boyle, great delivery from Calvin Miller, you know you have something tangible to hang on to.“I’m so pleased, I don’t want to go overboard because it is only three points but it is a big three points for the club.”"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"Swindonrsquos own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the thAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"jim-brogan-tears-as-friends-and-family-gather-in-glasgow-to-say-goodbye-to-celtic-legend","story":"THE funeral of Celtic legend Jim Brogan has taken place in Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"its-time-to-get-booking-your-next-christmas-party-venue","story":"Whether you can believe it or not, the time for festive planning is here.

On a Monday she heads to Longhope on South Walls via ferry, flies from Kirkwall Airport to Stronsay on Tuesday, Westray on Wednesday and Sanday on Thursday before finishing off the week on the mainland at Orkney’s Stromness.Today’s jaunt to North Ronaldsay and Papa Westray is her ‘once a month’ drop in, to help locals with deposits, withdrawals, and banking support – from delivering foreign currency to offering help with online services.On each island she serves around  to  customers, from crofters to fishermen, plus those serving the tourist industry by running BBs.“The service has changed a little over the years thanks to the onset of online and phone banking,” says Anne. “But it’s important for customers to receive the ‘personal touch’.“They can come to me and pay in some cash or withdraw some, and I can give them change, advice and answer any queries.“I really enjoy having this personal link with customers, and they really appreciate the service.”The job has its perks too, she adds. “I regularly look out of each of the island bank office windows to see a family of seals playing in the waves, or stretched out sunbathing on the beach, something that is special and unique to the mobility of my role.”The flying banker role was launched in  by Mary Muir, who did the job for almost  years before handing over to Anne in .It seemed almost right that she took on the role – years earlier her great-uncle skippered the island’s floating bank service, taking the teller from port to port to carry out his duties.Anne’s work in helping islanders bank led to her receiving an MBE in , and more recently she received a specially engraved glass plaque commemorating her many flights, from Loganair pilot Colin McAllister.“I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the last  years hopping across the islands,” she adds. “Every day is dferent and the views on my daily commute never get old.“It really is a privilege to be the UK’s only flying banker and take a commute like this to work each day and help so many people and communities.”The flying banker service is just one of many ways Royal Bank is meeting the needs of its customers. The bank has appointed a team of Community Bankers who travel to towns and villages across the country, bringing banking services to libraries, coffee shops and community centres.Royal Bank are committed to bringing banking services, support and advice to people who might not otherwise be able to reach a branch – its  mobile branches stop off in dozens of rural locations every day.It’s all in addition to the bank’s market leading app, online service and many other ways to bank."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen woman claimed 18000 in benefits she wasnt entitled to","story":"An Aberdeen woman has been handed unpaid work after admitting claiming almost £, in benefits she was not entitled to.Jenner Sievewright, also known as Morrison, received £,. in housing benefit and widowed parents allowance between August  and April .The -year-old failed to noty Aberdeen City Council and the Department of Work and Pensions that she was living with her new husband.Fiscal depute Sally McAuley told Aberdeen Sherf Court: “This information came to light as the DWP received anonymous intelligence.”Sievewright appeared yesterday for sentencing having previously pled guilty of failing to give prompt notication to authorities of a change in circumstances and obtaining money she was not entitled to.Defence agent Michael Burnett said: “It appears to have been motivated not out of greed or desire for a lavish lestyle but by desire to provide some security for her children.”Sherf Sukhwinder Gill said: “I see you offered to repay at the derisory sum of £ per week.

Both Hearts and ourselves have been working closely behind the scenes.“These are showcase games and this is a far better solution for our fans.“Our concern was to get as many of our fans to what should be a cracking game and hopefully we can now focus on the football which is how it should be.“It’s good we’re in semi-finals, but for such big games the kick-off time has to make it easy for fans to get to.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/mcwalter_1.jpg ","title":"how joining the british army opened up my world to travel and education","story":"As recruitment for new soldiers begins in the north-east, Lance Corporal McWalters, tells why serving with the British Army helped to turn his le around.Sitting in a classroom day after day, it’s hard to imagine carving out a career in the world of work.And that was especially the case for Aberdeen-born McWalters, who admits he didn’t always get along with his teachers and always tried to be the funny lad.Like many people across the country, McWalter didn’t always know what he wanted to do with his le – jumping around from job to job as a teenager and getting in spots of bother, he soon found a place he could belong. vw, px\"  McWalter soon joined the Army and began serving in the Royal Electrical Mechanical Engineers, where he started to forge a successful career and grow as a person.“My job role is basically I can fix vehicles and I can diagnose problems, soa vehicle goes down then the mission is not going to be successful.”“The thing I’ve enjoyed about my job is that I’ve learned a trade that I’ll have for the rest of my le.

I won it first time round at Cove and then again at Formartine.“But we’re not dwelling on the past, it would be good to get this one under the belt this early in the season.“They are happy memories the first time at Cove we beat Buckie and then at Formartine we beat Inverurie.“It’s always good to win cup finals, whoever you are playing for.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"red star exit cup after disappointing performance","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Red Star crashed out of the Scottish Cup on Saturday after an error-strewn replay performance was punished by a clinical Southside team.As in the original tie, Red Star got off to a terrible start, finding themselves two goals down inside  minutes after sloppy errors. To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore#s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a - victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September  when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

She explained her fascination with how each portrayed the concept in very dferent ways, from the peaceful portrayal of moonlit nature to expressions of personal  emotion, struggle and grief.The first work Anna played was Scriabin’s second Sonata, Sonata Fantasie. The ‘moonlit’ first movement was exquisite and the execution of the theme and pianissimo accompaniment at the end was stunning: the helter skelter finale was brilliant.Chopin’s Fantasie in F min, which followed, took us into the realms of personal struggle and, with Anna’s innate musicianship, she made cohesive sense of what can appear a somewhat fragmented work.To end the first part of the recital we heard a flawless rendition of Beethoven’s much-loved Moonlight Sonata, and despite the high octane speed of the finale one could hear every single note.After the interval came Mozart’s D min Fantasia. This deceptively easy-looking short piece, executed perfectly by Anna, demonstrated how dficult it is to play his music where every note and phrase requires minute attention.To conclude her recital, Anna chose Schumann’s great Fantasie in C. This work, while dedicated to Franz Liszt is, in the first movement at least, more an outpouring of his frustration at being denied the hand of his beloved Clara with all its sudden changes in mood. The very technically demanding second movement – a march – is more of a dedication to Liszt and was a thrilling listen. The final slow transcendental movement, which could well have been inspired by the opening movement of Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata, took us into a world of ethereal tranquility.After much applause Anna gave us Rachmaninov’s Prelude in G# min. Op. No. as a fitting encore.After this ‘fantasy’ journey one could only join with those who have been so impressed by the depth and power of Anna’s musicianship. Her ability to squeeze the last drop of emotion from every phrase was very special and a privilege to experience. Finally, to walk out into the clear night air and see the moonlight reflected off the sea like shards of silver seemed an apt end to an evening of fantasy.PIC:Pianist prodigy, Anna Feorova.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

It was just another average day at Doonfoot Primary, until a bat managed to fly off piste and get its teeny wing wedged in a window frame. Luckily Batman, PH’s Mr Rory Hall sprung into action to free the cute creature. The superhero was accompanied by sidekick Robin- or rather the school’s janitor Brian Robb. The pair worked together to prise open the window and get the winged animal to safety, while other staff members stood below with a safety net. And the Pipistrelles bat even received some special treatment of a cosy box and a well deserved drink before the Bat Society team popped along to get the animal back to Gotham City.  Janitor Brian said: “We knew it was there during the day but we just thought it was hanging there. “But parents said to me later on that it was still there. “We contacted the Bat Society to see what we should do as we knew they were protected. “It’s wing had actually been caught, so I had to go up beside Mr Hall and prise the window frame open with a screwdriver. “We put it into a box then Mr Hall gave it some water and later on that night we released it.” Rory added: “I spent a couple of hours and stayed with it to make sure it was calm and relaxed. “I gave it a solution of salt, sugar and warm water, which the Bat Society gave us, and it was like an energy drink for him. “Half an hour after that, I took it out and hung it out at the sensory garden and off it flew.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13347961.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_nip_rgr_041018flowers_1JPG.jpg","title":"caring toryglen grans who set","story":"NewsCaring Toryglen grans who set up club for pensioners are honoured in new Reformer competitionShareByNiki Tennant:,  OCT NewsCathy and Suzanne were delighted with their flowers, presented by Cathys daughter Meika \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo caring grans, who have opened up a new world of fun and friendship for Toryglen pensioners, have become the first recipients of stunning bouquets in the Reformer’s new Say it with Flowers competition.When Meika Thomson read that the Rutherglen Reformer wanted to say ‘thanks a bunch’ every week to unsung heroeswho make a real dference to their community, she didn’t hesitate to nominate her mum Cathy and best friend Suzanne Curran for a beautul bouquet from Burnside florist, Stems.Cathy and Suzanne, who have run the Toryglen After School Care club for  years, refused to turn the other cheek when they saw pensioners from a neighbouring sheltered housing complex staying indoors, living in isolation and lacking company and companionship. Saying hello to Cathy and Suzanne as they passed the Geoff Shaw community centre where the after school club meets was often the only interaction some of the pensioners from the Thistle Housing complex had. When Polmadie Fire Station donated a snooker table to the club nearly three years ago, Cathy and Suzanne saw it as an opportunity to persuade elderly residents to leave their armchairs and drop into the centre for a game of snooker and a chat. A resident from the housing complex spread the word among his neighbours and soon eight men were going to the centre to while away their afternoons and evenings with a game of snooker and friendly banter. Glasgow Le’s Mark Hudson suggested establishing a sports hub in the centre and advised Cathy and Suzanne how to apply for funding. Thanks to the two grans, carpet bowls, team tennis, boccia, badminton, sitting tai chi and computing classes were soon added to the list of activities on offer at the centre for Toryglen pensioners. “We had a marvellous time getting to know them,” said, Cathy, , of King’s Park.  “At first, they were gentlemanly, but within two weeks, they’d come out of their shell and were just being themselves.” Before she and Cathy stepped in, Suzanne said elderly residents from the housing complex on Kerrylamont Avenue would pass each other as strangers on the way to the local shops. Now they are friends who are in and out of each other’s homes. “It is just wonderful, seeing the dference in their lives,” said -year-old Suzanne, of Toryglen. “Seeing them from hardly walking to totally changing is marvellous. One man did not go out the house after losing his we a couple of years before, and he just loved the company.” Volunteers Cathy and Suzanne organised a bus to take the neighbours on a day trip to Ayr - and the appreciative group paid for the pair’s seats to the seaside. The two women are now planning their annual pensioners’ Christmas lunch at which kids from the after school club will delight diners by singing carols. In nominating her mum and Suzanne, Meika told the Reformer: “Some of these men had not even been outside their doors in over a few years, so this got them back into the community. Most recently, they have set up a memories group where they meet and talk about the past. “These groups have created a great feeling and the residents have created a great relationship with Cathy and Suzanne and also give the kids from the after school a wee hello when they pass by.” Choking back the tears as Meika presented them with the Stems’ bouquets, Cathy said: “I am speechless. We don’t often get a pat on the back. That’s not what we do this for. But to be acknowledged like this is simply wonderful.” To nominate someone for a hand-crafted bouquet from Stems, send your name, address and contact number, the name of the person you wish to nominate and information about why you think they deserve to receive the Bouquet of the Week to: Say It With Flowers competition, Rutherglen Reformer, One Central Quay, Glasgow G DA, or email news@rutherglenreformer.

Thankfully the ninth Duke, Arthur Charles Valerian Wellesley, has much less of a fight on his hands. His battle is to gain planning permission to add a fine conservatory to his listed country manor. Bardrochat House and estate lies deep in the Stinchar Valley just outside Colmonell.  But the big house came with a tacky plastic conservatory which was put in during the s. The Duke, now , and known as Charles, wants to flatten it and build an elegant stone replacement befitting of his house and surrounding shooting and fishing Dalreoch Estate. But he has to gain listed building consent first. Architect Luke Moloney said: “This relatively recent extension to the house is incongruous for its comparative lack of quality, in both detailing and materials, and has therefore deteriorated to a point where its continuing repair becomes uneconomical. “The existing conservatory, however, is of no such signicance, but rather detracts from and compromises the fine architectural quality of the rest of the house.” The new building is masonry, partly harled, and with simple stone dressings, to match the spirit and fabric of the main house. The report by the architect to South Ayrshire Council adds: “Metal windows, and patent glazing to the roof, continue the long traditions of the British domestic conservatory. Cast iron rainwater hoppers drain the roof.” The Duke also enjoys the title Marquess of Douro and is married to a Prussian Princess. Bardrochat had been home to generations of the McEwen family from  to  and was a secret haunt of Princess Margaret. Inside, the pile is noted for a galleried, timber led entrance hall with barrel vaulted ceiling. Decorative plaster ceilings to the music room and drawing room are particularly fine. The Duke’s younger brother Lord Richard Wellesley lives on the Knockdolian estate nearby. This was their maternal grandfather Douglas McConnel’s property. South Ayrshire Council will reach a decision later on whether to grant listed consent.

And the ‘hey presto’ thing of the past has moved on a bit. A young magician is climbing up the magicians’ ladder. Fraser Stokes, , has just ed from a convention in Southport run by the International Brotherhood of Magicians with two awards. He reckons he is the first Scot since  to win one of them – the giant Dittia Shield. Fraser, who lives in Straiton, said: “This shield is only ever given to someone who demonstrates excellence in manipulation and I am delighted. Manipulation is classed as the highly dexterous sleight of hand on stage.” It is a heady rise since performing his first magic ‘gig’ aged eight at Straiton Gala Day. Fraser admits: “I thought then it was a volume thing and I think I cleared Tam Shepherds trick shop in Glasgow of most of the stock. “I had three tables which took about half an hour to build. “Fortunately now the quality has gone up a bit and the quantity well down.” The former Carrick Academy pupil is now trying to make a full-time professional career from his magic shows on stage and at kids parties and is attending business courses to help market himself. And he has ed from Stockport with a real spring in his step. Fraser said: “There were world-class performers there including Richard Cadell from the Sooty Show and he said my technique was world-class. “Also the first European champion of magic, Dion, came to me to say ‘I love your work, your performance made me emotional’.”As a BA Hons Drama student and member of Ayr acting troupe Fib, Fraser enjoys putting some theatre into his act. He said: “Just doing tricks is not really that enthralling –I think the audience needs to be spellbound .”Dad David, mum Alison and elder brother Calum – who works with the UN in Thailand – have seen most of his work, from the faltering first steps at the kitchen table in Straiton, to real magic on stage. The family moved to the village from Barassie when he was eight. Fraser, a member of Kilmarnock Magic Circle, said: “I have always loved magic but it was  years ago I started serious practice. “For birthdays and Christmas I always asked for money for my visits to Tam Shepherds. “These days there are loads of actors but hardly any magicians so I really hope to make a full-time career out of it. “Theatrical magic is my speciality, not the sawing a woman in two stuff. “It is a challenge, but I work long and hard trying to master the moves for my cabaret acts and for the competitions.” One day Straiton Gala, next the Las Vegas strip, with a little magic of course.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsTheatre"},{"url":null,"title":"new property company mystery over","story":"NewsNew property company mystery over Ayr Station HotelMalaysian owners sets up new firm for \"buying and selling of own real estate\"ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStation Hotel Safety work continues \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new property company linked to the Station Hotel in Ayr has been set up.

Since then South Ayrshire Council has tried and failed to negotiate with him in an attempt to keep the rat-infested building safe. Two dangerous building notices were issued.

She said: “We trained twice a week - on a Thursday evening and a Sunday afternoon for two and a half to three hours. “And the whole team met up to do that. “There was  in a team all dancing in unison.  “So the men had to keep in line with each other and when the girls went out to curtsy we all did that at the same time. “It was a bit nerve-wracking knowing that millions of people were watching you. “And you didn’t want to make a mistake because in a formation team,you did, you’d stick out like a sore thumb.” When Janet started to dance she was  years old and in her teenage years she achieved her bronze, silver, gold, British Medallion and Blue Ribband medals in ballroom. She then went into formation dancing on the series when she was , under the reign of trainer Jim Graham. The Jim Graham formation team were Scottish Champions for three years and represented Scotland at the British Open Amateur Championships in Blackpool until the team disbanded when Jim emigrated to Canada. And the ballroom beauty even met her late husband through the art of dance. Janet said: “George and I were actually dancing at that same time. And that was how we met. “I was dancing with the team at the Albert Ballroom in Glasgow, which is no longer there, and he walked up and spoke to me. “It wasn’t very often you got chatted up by a man in white bow tie and tails.”  Although George never danced on TV, he was Janet’s partner when the pair competed together in amateur competitions. And she even learned a new style to compete alongside her love. She added: “I remember we were also having private lessons because he had done Ballroom and Latin American but I didn’t know anything about Latin American so we went for lessons so we could compete in the Latin American status as well.” Janet remembers nervously waiting for her team to appear on television, as the formation dancers were the last to feature. She said: “In the original Come Dancing there was a modern ballroom section, where somebody danced the Waltz or the Foxtrot or Tango. “And then there was a Latin American section and they either did the Cha Cha, Rumba or another dance. “The Jive was in the off-beat section and that got points as well. “And then the formation team were the last to go on. “Now they don’t do it that way. “But we were dancing against maybe north east England or south of England, and they were filmed in their ballroom and we were filmed in the La Cava in Glasgow. “The dresses that I wore were the team dresses but when the team was disbanded nobody said ‘give us them back’ or whatever as the trainer went to Canada.”  Now the dancer will display a few of her dresses for fans of the original series or for those with the Strictly fever. On display will also be Janet’s yellow dresswhich she wore when she danced as an amateur with husband George. “There’s a wee bit of history to that dress,” said Janet. “My formation team trainer Jim Graham was actually the Scottish Open professional champion in Ballroom. “And he and his we May competed and that was May’s dress so I bought it from her. Looking back on her time on the series, Janet added: “There’s a lot more dress than flesh in these days. “They were big and puffy and layers and layers of net and jewelled skirt. “Now when you watch it, although I enjoy it, they’ve not got much dress on! “I think I preferred it my way but I suppose that’s natural. Janet admitted Ballroom was always her favourite style of dancing, and she was sad when the Come Dancing series had come to an end. She added: “I missed it but I still enjoy watching it.” You can view Janet’s dresses at the Carnegie Library until October .

Cruel yobs smashed the front window of hair and beauty salon Head Kandi on Dalrymple Street. But after recent news that CCTV cameras are in working order, salon owner Claire Taylor was told the opposite - meaning the heartless vandals may get away with it. And now she is calling for action. Claire, , told the Post: “The police woke me up at three in the morning and said “your windows been smashed in”. “I was in shock. “The police told me it happened between am and am and it was a traffic cone that got put through it. “The cone was further down the street so somebody’s lted it and brought it up. “And they told us that CCTV, there’s one right at the corner, doesn’t work. “I’ve heard from people in the town that they have been going from shop to shop for their CCTV in hopes that one has picked it up.  “Luckily it was only a smashed window but something really serious could have happened and there’s no CCTV in the town to pick it up.” The salon owner has only recently moved to her new salon, having been open less than two months. Claire added: “We’ve actually only been open six weeks as I just moved premises. “I’ve spent the past four months doing it up and then this happens. “I was pretty gutted. “A couple of weeks ago when previous vandalism happened, everyone said “oh aren’t you lucky it wasn’t yours” and then that happens. “We had shutters on the windows but took them off because they were damaged when we got the property. “And everyone kept saying “oh you should get shutters back up”, but I thought in this day and age nobody smashes windows  “And how wrong was I. “I definitely would like to see them get punished and fined to teach them a lesson. “They can’t go round and do that.  “And the time and money that’s went in- they should be punished for that.” Now the business owner of eight years is calling for proper working CCTV. She added: “But the camera situation definitely needs something done about it. “It’s  now, we should have some sort of better technology. “A couple of weeks ago councillors confirmed the CCTV does work but the police told me it doesn’t - so we’re unsure what the issue is. “We’ve now went and arranged to get CCTV put in the shop ourselves in case of further vandalism, but we shouldn’t really need to do that.” A Police spokesman commented: “Police Scotland received a report of a vandalism to a business property in Dalrymple Street, Girvan during the early hours of Saturday, September . “PC Munro of Girvan Response policing team is conducting robust enquires into the matter. “Anyone with information is requested to contact  and quote incident number  of September ”. Girvan Community Council will be discussing the issue at this month’s meeting.

Reports that some of their friends had been seen near the town made the magistrates fear that they may try to help the prisoners escape.But what was troubling them more was the ldquoburdensome cost and inconvenience of incarcerating so many people. A decision on their fate was needed quickly.The town authorities had followed the law by putting them in prison. In fact, the law was clear that they should all be executed.But since there were women and children among them the Haddington authorities had hesitated to carry this out.They needed guidance and instruction from the Privy Council, and so a rider was dispatched with a letter asking for instructions, and the prisoners had to wait to hear of their fate. What had these people done to be under sentence of death It was nothing they had done. Their crime was who they were. They were gypsies just to be a gypsy was a capital offence.It was Arthur of Whittinghehame who had apprehended the families. The scene of this raid is not recorded.Was it a night raid, dragging women and children from their tents  Had they been families passing en route or camped nearby. Whole families were taken, but perhaps some escaped.Those who fled were perhaps the ones later seen near Haddington, worried and concerned about the fate of those imprisoned. No resistance seems to have been offered, forit had, the violence would have certainly been noted and used against them.They were accused of no crime other than that of being gypsies. It was a Privy Council edict in  which first declared the death penalty for being a gypsy in Scotland.It was written into statue by an act in .The Act called on all ldquogood subjects to apprehend gypsies and for the local authorities to imprison them and ldquoexecute to death the said Egyptians, either men or women. .And so these families were victims of a law that aimed to ethnically cleanse Scotland of gypsies. The Act was motivated by racist hatred and the only evidence needed to condemn someone to death was a Gypsy name, being known as a gypsy, or just associating with known gypsies.When the reply from the Privy Council arrived it was brutally clear in its instructions.It said there was a need to set an example to ldquothe rest of that infamous byke, thereby comparing gypsies to a nest of wasps or hornets.It continued: ldquoThe lords of secret counsel ordains the sherf of Haddington or his deputes to pronounce doom and sentence of death upon the men, and the women without children ldquothe men to be hangit and the women to be drowned.The women with children were to be spared death, but were to be ldquoscourgit threw the burgh of Haddington and burnt on the cheek.They would then be banished from Scotland. The Provost and bailies of Haddington were ordered to speedily carry out this sentence as stated. We can only assume these instructions were adhered to with little delay. If so, the executions will have been in public, and must have been a scene of horror, possibly witnessed by the friends and relatives.They were not the first gypsy families to suffer this persecution. In fact a number of gypsy families living in the Roslin area of Midlothian had previously been rounded up in . They had committed no crimes and kept a low profile. The Privy Council even complained that they were living ldquoasthey were lawful subjects. Their crime however, was to be ldquopart of an outlawed race and they were taken to Edinburghrsquos Tolbooth. The men were hanged and the women and children were banished from Scotland forever under pain of death.The aim of the persecution was to rid Scotland of Gypsies all together. So Gypsy families found themselves living like the wolf, hunted and in constant danger of capture. The Act of  was only part of it. An even earlier edict had empowered the masters of salt pans and coal mines to capture and enslave gypsies and other ldquovagabonds for servitude in the mines and salt pans.Many miners and salt panners at that time would have been enslaved gypsies. In many ways, their experience of state persecution and social discrimination mirrored that of the MacGregors, a Highland clan who were proscribed at much the same time.And like the MacGregors many gypsy families changed their names to avoid being identied.Others felt forced to changed their lestyle and hide their true identity, while some lived on the edge, with a constant risk of imprisonment or death. This was why there was a concentration of gypsy families close to the English border, as the laws were dferent in England.The attempt to exterminate gypsies from Scotland failed, they survived despite the persecution.But most of the misery and injustice caused remains unrecorded by history, although is not unforgotten by the gypsy community.In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries gypsies often shared the road with other travellers, many from the Highlands or Ireland, creating a gypsy traveller tradition with distinct cultural dferences between them, but a shared ldquonon-settled lestyle.But even when the laws were no longer enforced, the social attitudes towards gypsies and then also travellers excluded them.They were too dferent in the way they looked and dressed, and especially in the way they lived their lives. They had their own language and didnrsquot fit in. So I was told when I was wee.I grew up with derogatory comments in the playground about lsquoTinksrsquo and lsquoGyposrsquo. Such attitudes had been passed down by adults. Without knowing it I absorbed the idea that they were a people not to be trusted or liked. It was all self evident to me at the time because so many people were saying it.The truth is, of course, no community is all good or all bad, and choosing to select something bad to justy a blanket prejudice of a people is racism and intolerance of dference. I was angry later that I had been taught to demonise a people I knew nothing about. I discovered their history, not just their persecution, but their cultural and economic contribution to our country. Gypsies and travellers are rightly proud of their traditions, and I believe they are not ldquoother, but an important part of Scottish le and culture.It is sad that so many gypsy and traveller families, even today, hide their identity because of the discrimination they may face. And that discrimination still remains entrenched I think. I overheard a very loud ldquodiscussion about gypsies on a bus last week in which derogatory terms were used to describe them.It reminded me of things I was told when I was younger, and which I once believed to be true. It echoed the language used in the  Act and made my spine shiver.I didnrsquot challenge these comments, but I think I should have, constructively and politely. But to be honest I was afraid to.Irsquom ashamed about that ndash silence is the ground on which intolerance and hatred can grow."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-brewing-for-coffee-shop-and-drive-through-takeaway","story":"The Motor Fuel Group has applied to East Lothian Council for planning consent for the outlet on land to the west of the existing Shell petrol filling station on Edinburgh Road.

In the early s Coronation Street commanded  million who watched Ena, Martha and Minnie snuggle up in The Snug to bitch about the ldquotart that was Elsie Tanner and her artful dodger son Denis.The Street worked because it was real, with entirely believable characters, as did subsequent event television such as Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, and Boys from The Blackstuff.But then we found other things to do.

But why  Thanks to HBO and Netflix and Amazon raising the bar, content is king. Thanks to Breaking Bad and House of Cards we demand drama that reflects the world around us ndash yet is one step removed from reality.Yes, we havenrsquot yet created The Wire or The Sopranos but McMafia at least reflected London as the virtual Russian state it is, where free range oligarchs play Monopoly and have enemies dropped from balconies onto spiked railings or suffocated in zipped up bags. A Very English Scandal, however, about the Thorpe affair, was wonderful, a historical tale of political loyalty ndash but so redolent of the fickleness of modern day politics: Trump- Kavanaugh  Salmond-Sturgeon And allegory, thankfully, is back with a vengeance. The Prisoner once tapped into the counter-culture rebellion of the late s. The Fugitive reflected the American issues of freedom and movement, in an existential framework.Now television is repositioning the dark themes of the day. In recent years, Dexter was an allegory for the crime and punishment debate. Right now, cult drama Killing Eve offers a subtext for relationships between women sometimes compelled to be together, yet in competition, one hoping to emulate the other ndash yet just maybe love to have the other offed. A wee hint of Theresa May and Penny Mordaunt, perhaps Meanwhile, big TV hits such as ITVrsquos Strangers and BBCrsquos Keeping Faith ask how we psychologically profile our partner.

Yet it still pulled in nearly nine million, its success predicated on the womenrsquos movement ethos ndash a strong, powerful, educated female rails against the abusive louse of a husband when he leaves her for younger gorgeousness. Yet, the same writer Mike Bartlettrsquos BBC drama Press is tight, reflective and and extremely well acted.Thatrsquos not to say some of the allegory we watch doesnrsquot irritate the eyes worse than a rogue midgie when yoursquore out on your bike. Picnic At Hanging Rock was an attempt to symbolise the power of modern female sexuality ndash but was as convincing as a teacherrsquos attempt to argue algebra will one day be useful.Vanity Fair was poor, despite aspirations to present modern-day dilemma in a th century context should I have sex with him even though I donrsquot fancy him, but he drives a Ferrari  At least both were trying to be socially relevant.Now, you may claim that drama can attract decent figures without clever allegorical intent, such as soaps.

Of course, the fight against climate change begins at home. The Carbon Metric report, a new study into Scotlandrsquos carbon impact, shows that less waste and more recycling, especially of food waste, are crucial in reducing our impact on the environment.Released in the recent Recycle Week , itrsquos a timely reminder that everyone in Scotland has the chance to play a part in our response to climate change. Iain Gulland, Chief Executive, Zero Waste Scotland, commented: ldquoOur Carbon Metric shows the crucial role householders can play in preventing waste and recycling more of their waste, particularly food waste, and how signicant an impact that will have on reducing our climate changing emissions.The Carbon Metric was developed by Zero Waste Scotland to measure the whole-le carbon impacts of Scotlandrsquos waste, from resource extraction and manufacturing emissions, right through to waste management emissions, regardless of where in the world these impacts occur and is a pioneering way to measure the carbon impact of our waste, not just the amount that is recycled.In , Scottish households reduced the amount of waste they produced, and recycled more of their waste than ever, resulting in the lowest carbon impacts for household waste since the Carbon Metric began measuring in .For the first time, the Carbon Metric has been integrated into the official reporting on Scotlandrsquos household waste data statistics published by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency . It reflects the critical role the Carbon Metric has come to play in measuring and reducing the environmental impacts of Scotlandrsquos waste, something that Terry ArsquoHearn, SEPA Chief Executive, has said it will ldquohelp us target our efforts to deliver One Planet Prosperity.Food waste contributes more to Scotlandrsquos waste carbon impacts than any other waste type, so itrsquos important that we avoid wasting food, and recycle the waste we canrsquot avoid. Food waste comprised % of household waste in . Despite an overall reduction in household food waste, Scots recycled more food waste than ever before, up % from just one year earlier.In total, Scottish households prevented almost , tonnes of food waste from going to landfill through food waste recycling.The increase in recycling rates is due to more household food waste recycling collections being rolled out by Scotlandrsquos local authorities ndash good news in terms of preventing food waste, which could be turned into energy through anaerobic digestion, from heading to landfill sites where it emits harmful greenhouse gases.Zero Waste Scotland has also published the  Carbon Metric, which contains data on both household and commercial and industrial waste. Importantly, as it includes all data for  this report demonstrates the disproportionate impact of household waste on the carbon impacts of Scotlandrsquos total waste.While household waste only made up % of Scotlandrsquos waste by weight, it accounted for % of total waste carbon impacts. This makes preventing and recycling household waste especially important. The Carbon Metric shows the progress that is being made in Scotland on recycling and the real impact that is having on tackling climate change.Those changes come in part from improvements and extensions to household recycling services offered by local authorities, but itrsquos also testament to the extra efforts that people in Scotland are going to, to make sure more is being recycled. If we are to make meaningful headway in tackling climate change, the Carbon Metric shows that waste prevention and recycling are crucial, and in that, each one of us has an important role to play.In association with ...The Scottish EnvironmentProtection Agency A non-departmental public body of the Scottish Government oversees environmental regulation, monitors and reports on the state of the environment, raises awareness of environmental issues, and resolves environmental harms.Zero Waste ScotlandA publicly-funded organisation working towards a society where resources are valued and nothing is wasted.

He was aged only  but during his short le distinguished himself as one of the foremost archaeologists of his day.Alexander Henry Rhind was born in Wick on July , . His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost  children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank.

September has a high rate of babies being born.ldquoStaff morale is already at an all-time low. Several experienced midwives are either retiring or leaving because of the added workload and the burden it is causing.Bill Fernie of the pressure group Caithness Health Action Team said he was not surprised that a midwe felt compelled to speak out.He said: ldquoItrsquos a terrible situation for the staff to find themselves in.

It is thought the smaller site would closethe new store went ahead, although Co-op Food had not responded by the time the Ross-shire Journal went to print.The applicant, Northquest Ltd, has also earmarked two further building plots for possible future development within the proposed storersquos grounds ndash another  sq ft building and one covering  sq ft.The store would be accessed via Ness Road and have parking for  cars and two motorbikes. The access road also features a bell-shaped junction at its far end, opening up the possibility that nearby land may also be developed in the futurethe site went ahead.The Fortrose and Rosemarkie Community Council has unanimously opposed the proposals, citing concerns over its location within a designated buffer zone that is designed to keep Fortrose and Rosemarkie from merging into one.Chairman Tom Heath said the community council felt the application fell foul of two elements of the local development plan, the first of which was its location.He added: ldquoThe second is that we were concerned of the effects it would have on the rest of the High Street and the viability of the remainder of the businesses on High Street [ it relocated].Those reactions have been shared by some residents, who have been responding to a consultation launched by the community council.While many welcomed the prospect of a larger Co-op store and greater iety on its shelves, others raised fears that the existing High Street shoprsquos off-street car park could be lost in the move ndash forcing cars to park on the main road and putting greater pressure on this notorious traffic bottleneck.Others shared the community councilrsquos argument that the development is on land zoned as off-limits in the local development plan.Fears had been raised that a decision last year by Highland councillors to approve a new poundmillion care home within this buffer zone would set a precedent that opened up the wider area to development. It was passed despite the objection of planning officers.And this concern was shared by some of the public.Responding on Facebook to the community councilrsquos call for comment, Gail Paterson said: ldquoIt will kill Fortrose High Streetallowed. The care homehas set a precedent so canrsquot see how this can be knocked back and from there on in the land will go to housing without the infrastructure being sorted out.Bridget Gerstner added: ldquoThe shop would be nice but not there. This is the foot in the door. Once we agree to this site, there will be no stopping building on the land between Fortrose and Rosemarkie.Mr Heath said the community council had taken fears over the care homersquos impact on the buffer zone to council officers last year, and that they had been given assurances that its approval would not set a precedent.- Share your view.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows # including the latest Rebus # ahead of its Scottish runIt has been more than  years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson. Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone .“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them. “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have -odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.“But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone ’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over  years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the -year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early  years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since .“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in  in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March .The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further  novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than  million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into  dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November . New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in  amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be  when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio ’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in  for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from - October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from - November www.aberdeenperformingarts.©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.The tapestry, measuring five metres long and four metres tall, took more than , hours to produce and involved  volunteers.The piece was produced by The Embroiderers’ Guild after HBO Home Entertainment TV Network, the company which produces Game of Thrones, contacted them and asked for a special artwork to form the backdrop to the DVD release of the show’s fth series.They stitched a tapestry featuring an intense battle scene - the massacre of Hardhome - and featuring a White Walker, one of the show’s central antagonists.• : Emmys: A win for Claire Foy as Game of Thrones retakes crownThe embroidery goes on display at Glasgow Caledonian University ’s Saltire Centre from September  and will remain on show to students, staff and members of the public until it is put up for auction in February .Anthea Godfrey, Embroiderers’ Guild artistic director and project manager, said: “This has been an amazing project that truly has brought the embroidery community together across the whole of the UK.“We are really proud to have been involved.”• : HBO teases fans with Game Of Thrones footage ahead of final seasonThe Embroiderers’ Guild has close links with GCU dating back  years, especially through its fashion programmes.John Cook, GCU media professor, added: “Game of Thrones is one of the biggest TV shows on the planet right now.“Aside from those who avidly consume it in box-sets, many even stay up half the night to watch when each new episode drops on UK TV.“I’m sure this embroidery will attract a great deal of interest  particularly from those who can’t wait until  and the release of the final season of GoT.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4809528.1538591932!/image/image.jpg","title":"tom peterkin on this issue richard leonard must stand up to corbyn","story":"Richard Leonard should stand up to the Labour party in London over the defamation case against Kezia Dugdale, writes Tom Peterkin.Kezia Dugdale may no longer be the leader of Scottish Labour but she has retained a knack for grabbing the headlines.Perhaps it should be no surprise that the Lothians MSP has failed to slide unobtrusively to the relative obscurity of the backbenches. She is, after all, the politician who decided that drinking an ostrich anus smoothie with a bunch of Z-listers in the jungle was preferable to supping from the poisoned chalice that became the Scottish Labour leadership. But unlike her controversialappearance on ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity”, the latest stushie to engulf Ms Dugdale is not one she wished upon herself.As her recent outbursts demonstrate, the £, defamation action she faces from the pro-independence blogger Stuart Campbell is a complication that is causing her much anxiety.Aside for the personal toll the legal action is taking on Ms Dugdale, her travails have serious repercussions for her successor Richard Leonard.Ms Dugdale’s defamation drama is rapidly turning into Mr Leonard’s leadership crisis.The turn of events that has raised questions about Mr Leonard’s stewardship of the party is a convoluted tale that has its origins in a column written by Ms Dugdale for the Daily Record.In one of her weekly contributions to the tabloid newspaper, Ms Dugdale described a tweet posted by Mr Campbell, the author of the “Wings Over Scotland” website, as “homophobic”. Mr Campbell’s tweet referred to the Tory MSP Oliver Mundell, the son of David Mundell, the Scottish Secretary who revealed that he was homosexual around two and a half years ago. According to Mr Campbell’s tweet, Oliver Mundell was “the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his sexuality sooner”.: David Mundell says he’ll support Kezia Dugdale in legal battleMr Campbell took umbrage at Ms Dugdale’s characterisation, denies his remarks were homophobic and is set to challenge the Labour MSP in court.As those who have been following this saga closely know, the Daily Record offered Ms Dugdale legal support when Mr Campbell’s action was launched. But then the newspaper’s lawyers met with Labour officials, who were adamant that the party should deal with it. Labour took on an agency, assembled a team of lawyers and told the Record to step aside.Things began to go awry for Ms Dugdale when it was revealed that, after paying out £,, the UK Labour party had decided to stop paying Ms Dugdale’s legal costs. She gave a series of interviews in which she talked about feeling crushed by her own party. Should the case go against her, she revealed she feared losing her house or even going bankrupt – an outcome that would cost the Labour MSP her job. Jeremy Corbyn was accused of ignoring her approaches for help as she suggested the decision was down to Jenny Formby, Labour’s new general secretary who happens to be close to the UK leader. This unseemly row was the cue for all manner of internal wrangling with allies of Ms Dugdale questioning why Labour was abandoning one of their own, mid court case. In response, the UK party has said it has a responsibility to all its members to spend party funds responsibly – the suggestion being that the cash would be better spent on campaigning in anticipation of another snap election.Since Labour pulled the plug on financing Ms Dugdale’s case, the Daily Record has said it has “reinstated” legal support for the former Scottish leader, although reports suggest Ms Dugdale could remain liable for Mr Campbell’s damages and costs should she lose.: Labour hits back in Kezia Dugdale legal fees rowRegardless ofand how Ms Dugdale’s costs are met, there is an important point of principle at stake here. Surely a political party should back its politicians to the hilt, particularly when being challenged by an online opponent who specialises in highly provocative blogs.But to the dismay of many Labour MSPs, Mr Leonard’s has remained tight-lipped about the whole sorry state of affairs. His silence reached deafening levels at a meeting of MSPs this week where Ms Dugdale’s supporters clashed with a noisy minority of left-wing members who are said to back the decision to halt the legal funding.Apparently Mr Leonard asked Ms Formby to reverse the decision, but was given short shrt. It is not a good look for an elected leader,he is unable to change the mind of a paid official. Furthermore, the Scottish Labour leader asked for a statement indicating his MSPs’ support for Ms Dugdale to be altered so that it did not include a specic call for the party to meet her full legal costs.None of this bodes well for Mr Leonard’s leadership. Whatever one’s views of Ms Dugdale – and it is true to say she is not everybody’s cup of ostrich anus smoothie – she deserves much better than this.Granted there are those who found her resignation as party leader and jungle-antics unhelpful. But this is an effective and elected LGBT Labour politician who stepped up to the leadership when few others wanted the toughest job in Scottish politics. For that, she should receive credit and protection.By failing to stand up for his predecessor, Mr Leonard does little to dispell the notion that he is in thrall to Mr Corbyn and his party is little more than a “branch office” of London. And what of the left’s much-vaunted commitment to solidarity  As one Labour MSP put it: “This should be about solidarity, rather than hanging someone out to dry.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4810216.1538673811!/image/image.jpg","title":"labour reshuffle i thought richard was better than this","story":"Richard Leonard has axed two of his most prominent frontbenchers in a shadow cabinet reshuffle that has sparked civil war in the Scottish Labour Party.The Scottish Labour leader was last night condemned by fellow Labour politicians for sacking Anas Sarwar and Jackie Baillie in a reshuffle described by Mr Leonard’s critics as a “victory for factionalism”.window.twttr Mr Sarwar and Ms Baillie are seen as centrist members of a Scottish party that has seen a widening split between Mr Leonard’s left-wing allies and the more moderate parliamentarians.The demotion of Mr Sarwar and Ms Baillie, who have been regarded as two of Scottish Labour’s best performing frontbenchers, was described as “sad” by Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray. : Scots Labour spin chief quits after six monthsMr Sarwar, who was narrowly defeated by Mr Leonard for the Scottish Labour leadership just over a year ago, was sacked as shadow health secretary.The Glasgow MSP said he was “very disappointed” to lose his job, adding he was dismayed to learn of his fate via Twitter while representing Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber. His imminent departure from Labour’s frontbench was even referred to by SNP health secretary Jeane Freeman in the debate on “women in sport”.: SNP figures pile Scottish independence pressure on Nicola SturgeonMr Sarwar met Mr Leonard to be told of his demotion – a courtesy that was not extended to Ms Baillie, the Dumbarton MSP who left parliament at pm sharp after several hours of speculation over her position.Ms Baillie, who is the only Labour MSP to have represented the same constituency since the birth of devolution in , was sacked over the phone from her job as shadow economy spokeswoman.Mr Leonard’s reshuffle came on the same day Scottish Labour’s head of communications Charlie Mann quit, saying the job was “not for me”.His departure followed several days of infighting over UK Labour’s controversial decision to halt its funding for former Scottish leader Kezia Dugdale’s legal battle against a pro-independence blogger. A majority of Labour MSPs believe the party should fully fund Ms Dugdale’s legal fees after Stuart Campbell, from the Wings Over Scotland ­website, brought a £, defamation case against her. Left-wing allies of Mr Leonard had claimed Ms Dugdale’s supporters were undermining his leadership. Mr Leonard had been criticised for failing to do enough to get the UK party to over-turn its decision. Mr Leonard claimed his new team would “focus on unity and the public, not ourselves and internal battles”.But hopes of uniting the party were dashed as soon as the shadow cabinet was announced. One Labour source described it as a “victory of factionalism over competence”. “It is like taking your two best players off the pitch when you’re three-nil down,” the source said. “This is straight out of the Corbyn playbook.”Mr Murray was angered by the dismissals. On Mr Sarwar’s sacking, Mr Murray said: “The purge of good, capable and committed people goes on merely for standing up for what they believe in. One of our most effective and likeable MSPs. I don’t know whether to be angry or sad. I thought Richard was better than this.”Moving on to Ms Baillie’s departure, Mr Murray said he was “sad, sad, sad” to see her sacked, describing her as “one of the most effective MSPs in Holyrood and very well liked in her constituency”.Mr Sarwar said: “It’s a shame I came to know about this decision through Twitter, while I was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber. I am incredibly proud of the work I did on behalf of NHS patients and staff, particularly the creation of a workforce commission, the campaign to end the pay cap and the fight to protect local services from SNP cuts. “For the sake of all the people who need a Labour government, I wish Richard Leonard and his shadow cabinet all the very best. I will continue to serve my constituents tirelessly from the backbenches, campaigning for issues close to my heart.”Monica Lennon is taking on the health post for the party. Mr Leonard will combine his leadership with the economy brief. In another controversial move Alex Rowley, Scottish Labour’s former acting leader who was suspended over harassment claims, was reinstated to the shadow cabinet. Mr Rowley, who rejected the claims, was appointed to the local government brief.Ms Baillie said: “I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve and will continue to be a strong advocate for my constituents – and Labour values. I wish Richard Leonard well for the future.” Mr Leonard said: “The refreshed shadow cabinet will take Scottish Labour into the central debate in Scottish politics: the clear choice between Labour’s plan to invest and build an economy that works for the many, not the few, or further austerity with the SNP and the Tories.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4809921.1538665324!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon uncomfortable about alex salmond allegations","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has indicated her discomfort at dealing with the sexual harassment allegations made against Alex Salmond as she denied being aware of complaints being swept under the carpet.At First Ministers Questions, Ms Sturgeon was asked about last weeks reports suggesting that a harassment claim against Mr Salmond was first investigated five years ago.It was reported that Mr Salmond apologised to the female complainant for a “misunderstanding” following the incident at Bute House in . According to reports, the woman accepted the apology and no action was taken against the then First Minister.Earlier this year, civil servants ordered another investigation into the incident along with a complaint from another woman. The fresh investigation came on the back of a review of Scottish Government policies in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal.The Scottish Government has said there were “no recorded complaints” against Mr Salmond before January this year.At Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said the new “Fairness at Work” procedure was introduced to prevent harassment claims being swept under the carpet.Mr Salmond was not mentioned by name at First Ministers Questions, but Labours Rhoda Grant asked Ms Sturgeon about “press reports that some historic complaints were not recorded and not dealt with appropriately or taken seriously”.The Labour MSP added that “ this is indeed the case perpetrators may have gone without challenge” before askingMs Sturgeon was aware of such cases.“No,” replied the First Minister. “I am not aware of any complaint having been swept under the carpet. Let me be very clear as First Minister I would not tolerate that being the case. Indeed it is because I believe and believe so strongly that complaints shouldnt be swept under the carpet that I signed off the new procedure in December.“I am very clear and have been consistently clear, as has the Permanent Secretary of the Scottish Government, that when complaints are raised they should be properly investigated no matter the seniority or the political affiliation of the person being complained about. What is important in all cases is that there is due process applied.”Shona Robison of the SNP then asked Ms Sturgeon to condemn the “utterly disgraceful” behaviour of Donald Trump and US senators for effectively putting a woman, who claimed to be an abuse victim, “on trial”.Ms Sturgeon said she was “horried” by events on the other side of the Atlantic.Ms Sturgeon went on to draw a comparison with the challenges she faces as a result of the claims against Mr Salmond.She said: “I think in this area, leadership is very important and these issues are not always comfortable. I perhaps know that more than most at this point.“But it is at times when things are not comfortable that leaders are tested about whether their rhetoric is just that or whether they are prepared to put that into action. I think it is really important that when people come forward with complaints they are not put on trial but there is due process for all concerned.”©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4810048.1538668533!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp figures pile scottish independence pressure on nicola sturgeon","story":"Senior SNP figures have called for Nicola Sturgeon to adopt a more \"urgent\" approach to staging a second independence referendum ahead of the partys conference this weekend.Former health Secretary Alex Neil warned a second vote on leaving the UK must take place \"as quickly as possible\" to offset the looming economic turmoil ofBrexit, while ex-Holyrood Presiding Officer Tricia Marwick said many independence supporters want the process \"moved forward.\"\u2028SNP delegates will gather in Glasgow on Sunday for the start of the three-day Autumn conference.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a - win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.Hunter also played in the legendary - victory in Orkney  years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.Sinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and  in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late s and early s is something .From  to  he played in just over  matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.Sinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in , apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.Another who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented  wins in  matches, the only blip being a - draw in Orkney.Then he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.Len Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on  caps and how he went out on a high.But the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.That is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.: : : : : : : :Did the best team really win the World Cup  That question has been asked theand breadth of the country after France’s - victory over Croatia on Sunday.Personally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it - was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced. predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.France were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.As for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.After England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twitever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.A group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team  I don’t think so.It happened at the World Cups of , ,  and , and also at the European Championship in . I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.Speaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.There were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.My team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut CourtoisBenjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan StrinicIvan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden HazardCristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .If anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.: : : : : : : :Several metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.Among them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.England quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.MaybeShetland wins the Milne Cup th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street” Or did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say..."},{"url":null,"title":"branch admin assistant for buildbase ","story":"This is a part time role which will be for approx.  hours per day, ideally am # pm or am # pm. • manage, organise, and update relevant data using database applications. • enjoy talking to lots of dferent people."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer for cdcn ","story":" The Board of the Community Development Company of Nestingare looking for an enthusiastic and motivated inidual to work closely with us to deliver the vision of a redeveloped Aald Skul as a multi-purpose community asset for the people of Nesting and the surrounding area.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section.

And it could yet be trebles all round for PJ MacKintosh’s men who are just one win away from clinching the premiership title to make it a hat-trick of senior trophies in , having already lted the MacTavish Cup earlier in the summer.After a frantic, but fairly even opening spell in which both goalkeepers made saves Newtonmore edged ahead on  minutes, and never looked back.Evan Menzies twisted away from his marker to rle in a shot from  yards which beat Stuart MacDonald, the Lovat keeper, at his near post. It was a bitter blow for a Lovat side striving to learn the lessons from defeat in last year’s final, when a slow start proved costly.Greg Matheson, the Kiltarlity side’s talisman, had the ball in the net but his effort was rightly ruled offside in what was a frustrating day for the Lovat attack.Newtonmore continued to make better use of the ball, and the wide spaces of the Mossfield pitch, and two goals on the stroke of half time all but settled the outcome.The second goal summed up the gulf in quality over the  minutes. The danger came after Lovat’s Craig Mainland shanked a shy on the right touchline, handing Newtonmore’s Jamie Robinson the opportunity for a hit-in of his own. From there his long looping effort was flicked to Glen MacKintosh who fashioned just enough space to steer a low bouncing effort beyond the ing MacDonald.Seconds later Menzies drilled in the third – another daisy cutter which crept in at the near post.When Marc MacLachlan, who had looked Lovat’s most likely goal threat, limped off after twisting his knee early in the second half the game was up for the Kiltarlity side.Newtonmore’s defence, in which youngster Crag Ritchie excelled alongside Rory Kennedy, Andy MacKintosh and Norman Campbell, held firm and keeper Kenny Ross would enjoy a largely trouble-free afternoon in what, at the grand old age of , was his first final.MacDonald made a terric save to deny Menzies a hat-trick, but the striker’s day was complete when he was awarded the Albert Smith medal as man of the match.He said: “Once we got our noses in front, with the defence we have we were always going to be tough to break down.“Hopefully there’s more to come – two points in the next game against Oban and we win the league, and that’s our target.”Lovat manager Fraser Gallagher conceded his team had been second best.“We didn’t have enough aggression in our defending in the first half, and put ourselves under pressure,” he added. “If anyone is going to knock them off the top it’s not because Newtonmore slip-up. Other teams are going to have to raise their standard.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles.

However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27470  ","story":" Michael McMonagleAs a former prisoner who is now an elected representative it is important that I visit these imprisoned Catalan elected representatives and raise their cases on the international stage. - Martina Anderson MEPAll Catalan political prisoners held by the Spanish authorities in relation to the Catalan independence referendum should be released immediately. That was the call made by Sinn Féin MEPs Martina Anderson and Lynn Boylan who visited Catalan political prisoners in three jails today as part of a delegation of MEPs from across Europe. The delegation visited nine political prisoners, including former ministers and elected representatives and well as independence activists.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit.  by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8650567.1538134353!/image/image.jpg","title":"happiest places in northern ireland revealed and the most miserable","story":"Scores were produced for council area by the Office of National Statisticsbased on four measures of personal well-being - le satisfaction, feeling that the things done in le are worthwhile, happiness and anxiety.Health, employment and relationship status are key determinants of personal well-being according to previous research done by the ONS.

When flying its important to work with the wind to plot the direction and path of a flight.Richard explained that hot air balloons work because hot air rises.By heating the air inside the balloon with the burner, it becomes lighter than the cooler air on the outside.This causes the balloon to float upwards, asit were in water. Obviously,the air is allowed to cool, the balloon begins to slowly come down.Henry Law, owner of The Little Ollie Balloon Team is a member of the retrieve team. He said he was delighted the balloon was able to make contact with Slemish. HISTORIC MOMENT He said: In order for me to retrieve the balloon when it lands, we use very precise location finders and two way radios, however I was able to see the balloon on the side of Slemish.Richard had radioed through to me to say he thought he would be able to make contact and Im so glad our on board GoPro camera captured the historic moment!Expalining how the balloon comes into land, Henry said: We normally like to land in a green field, and always try to seek the permission of the land owner before doing so.We pick non-crop fields and ones without livestock so as to cause no damage or inconvenience.Quite a large area is needed for landing as sometimes the balloon travels along the ground before coming to a stop, therefore the top of a mountain wouldnt have been safe to try to make a total stop.“However, making contact is a great achievement and we are so proud we were able to achieve it.

Each child is unique and brings a wealth of le experience, within their family and community, to their school setting.

The church made from hay to promote Rathfriland Presbyterian Churchs Harvest service It was the church’s minister, Rev Trevor Boyd, who first introduced hay sculptures in conjunction with First Rathfriland’s annual harvest service: “We’ve been doing a harvest build for four years – we’ve had teddy bears, cows, this year we’ve went for a church.“Historically, and still currently, harvest is one of those occasions when people tend to go to church.

We thought this year we’d put the church back in the centre of it.”Of the newly built church, he said: “It’s a bit of a step up from a teddy bear but we have a willing band of workers, so fair play to them for putting this together. “There was probably about a dozen people of all ages working on it.

People come to it to have their photos taken. People look forward to seeing what’s going to be on the site.“This year with Storm Ali it was a wee bit later.

Much further-reaching on trade, internal security and foreign policy cooperation. This is a true measure of respect. And this offer remains in place. #brexit— Donald TuskOctober , His intervention comes after Mrs May told the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham that her Chequers plan was the only proposal which would avoid the imposition of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Tory Brexiteers – who say Chequers would keep Britain too closely tied to the EU after it has left the bloc – warmly welcomed Mr Tusk’s comments saying they showed another deal was possible.Mr Tusk said: “Let me make this clear: the EU wants a relationship with the UK that is as close and special as possible.“From the very beginning, the EU offer has been not just a Canada deal, but a Canada+++ deal.My press statement on #Brexit after meeting Taoiseach @campaignforleo https:t.co gamWXEFr pic mTuVlHYm— Donald TuskOctober , “Much further-reaching on trade, on internal security and on foreign policy cooperation.

Dr Julie-Ann Maney, who was recalled to the witness box after giving evidence on Monday, explained that it appeared Caragh had \"respiratory dficulty\" and was \"breathing slowly\".Dr Maney added that respiratory arrest then caused her heart to stop and prevented oxygen from travelling to the brain.Mr ONeill was asked to check for signs of le, confirming each time he heard his daughter take and release a breath.\"I dont know whats wrong,\" he said, before through tears he added, \"I cant look at her.\"I tried to force a bottle in her mouth to seeshe would take it,\" he added, after stating that \"her eyes are closed and shes shaking.\"Shortly after emergency services arrived, the father was heard directing ambulance staff to his home. Seconds later, the call ended.Caragh spent two days in hospital before succumbing to a severe brain injury at half past one in the afternoon of February , .Dr John McCabe was the registrar at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children when Caragh was admitted. He told the court that trauma became the \"main dferential\" after speaking to Caraghs father at the hospital. The doctor displayed to the court the way in which Mr ONeill tried to revive his daughter, a movement he described as \"vigorous\". Counsel for Mr ONeill said it conflicted with that of another medic who gave evidence on the first day.Dr McCabe added that this did not change the approach to Caraghs treatment.Mr ONeill attended the inquest yesterday, which is set to last for five days."},{"url":null,"title":"a long drive home for armagh familys","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldBrexitPoliticsWest Tyrone By-Election General Election NI Assembly Election HealthSunday LeEducationLittle ReportersGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyColumnistsPaul LindsayDeclan BogueBilly on the boxRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyMoneyCyber SecurityUK  WorldBrexitTechnologyJobsFood, Drink and HospitalityAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop  CompaniesBusiness AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsFood  DrinkRecipesRestaurant ReviewsFood  Drink MagazineFood  Drink Awards GuideFeaturesBooksRunningFamily LeSeptember June February May April February December September  Great Summer WalksCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Of particular interest to local readers will be sections on Saul mdash the place of Patrickrsquos landing.Observing the interest of those outside Ireland on St Patrick, John began thinking seriously about his book project five years ago.He said: ldquoSt Patrick is so obviously supported across the world ndash what is it that causes that support ldquoI was brought up outside Downpatrick in Loughinisland. I assumed I knew everything about St Patrick. I wanted to see ndash what do we know about St Patrick  I wanted to go back. I wanted an anthology of peoplersquos writings throughout the centuries, build up a picture of what he was and what he means throughout our history over , years.John said some of his findings were a ldquototal surprise, such as the article by Maureen Donnelly lsquoThe Altar Stone of Saul Abbeyrsquo. This details how the altar stone on which Patrick is said to have celebrated Holy Communion ended up on a wagon owned by a man who wanted it for the doorstep of his new house at the junction of Saul Street and Scotch Street in . But the wagon overturned, the stone broke and it found its way instead to the Catholic Church in Saul.ldquoI never realised there was an altar stone of St Patrick actually in Saul chapel, John said. ldquoI went three times to try and see it. I could not get in the first time as there was a ceremony on. It took me a bit of time to find it. This is one of the earliest and possibly holiest relics in Ireland open to all to see.John said he was also ldquoblown away by a stained-glass window, lsquoPatrick Arrives in Saulrsquo, in Saul Chapel.ldquoThe three windows are designed so the three windows show one image, he explained. ldquoIt is absolutely beautul.John is the author of many books, including The Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.Surrounded by sites linked to our patron saint in Downpatrick, John believes at times we ldquocanrsquot see the woods from the trees.He points to the massive success of less important sites in the south, or how such a historical location would promoted ldquoto the nth degree in the US.ldquoI think that is the challenge for people here today, he said. ldquoThere is so much scope, there really is. I think we lose the wood from the trees. So many stories, so many things to pursue.Interestingly, his research points to an attitude from some in the south of Patrick being a ldquonorthern saint. There is also, of course, the increased secularisation of Ireland.ldquoBut there are still a massive amount of people who are people of faith, John continued.ldquoWe live in an area of huge historical importance.

Evenyou didnrsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. Itrsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.Thatrsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.Irsquod say that you canrsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.Itrsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really donrsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I donrsquot think theyrsquore going about it in the best way.If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as yoursquore passing.If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to seethere are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isnrsquot going to do me much good.A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isnrsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the storersquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where theyrsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.We wouldnrsquot have had the ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that therersquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go therethey donrsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast arenrsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but itrsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, wersquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so therersquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses canrsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. Itrsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.If Translink brought back opentickets, Irsquom sure wersquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break.

Owned and controlled by farmers, with over , milk suppliers and a collective milk pool of some .bn litres, the new co-op will be the second largest dairy processor on the island of Ireland. It will have a combined annual turnover in excess of €bn, creating internationally competitive scale while ensuring efficient costs of operation.The announcement was made jointly by the chairman of LacPatrick Dairies, Andrew McConkey and the chairman of Lakeland Dairies, Alo Duffy, together with Michael Hanley, CEO of Lakeland Dairies who will be appointed Group CEO of the new merged co-operative society which will adopt the name of Lakeland Dairies.Mr McConkey said the board of LacPatrick firmly believes that an amalgamation with their neighbours is the best thing for milk suppliers, shareholders and customers. He added: “It gives our farmers the necessary security to make long-term business decisions and provides stability for continuing progress in dairy farming for the next generation.”Meanwhile, Mr Duffy said the merger proposal is a once in a letime opportunity for both co-operatives to continue their strong progress in a very meaningful way.Mr Hanley added: “I am confident that the best interests of the shareholders and milk producers of both societies will be best served through this merger. “The economies of scale achievable by combining both societies will create a larger, more efficient, ersied, farmer-controlled, global dairy food group with a broad portfolio of value-added products and brands. “Both co-operatives have excellent facilities, technologies and resources with strong synergies across our milk processing footprint and in the markets we serve at home and abroad.”DAERA announces % rate for advance CAP payments for  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Nigel Dodds repeated the DUPs consistent line on the need to keep the United Kingdom together during Brexit That would be offset, the paper suggested, by the EU agreeing to concede that under the backstop plan the whole UK, rather than just Northern Ireland, would stay in the customs union for a limited period until a trade deal was finalised.A similar report – which emanated from Irish government sources – appeared in The .When asked whether in that scenario the DUP would bring down the prime minister, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds said:“The government knows where we stand and we have been consistent over the last number of years of the necessity of keeping the United Kingdom together as we exit the European Union.“We would not support any proposal in terms of Brexit that would breach our red line on the constitutional or economic integrity of the United Kingdom.“Were any such proposal to come forward we would vote against it alongside many dozens of Conservative Party MPs in Parliament and the government would be forced to think again and take a dferent course.”Another senior DUP source told the News Letter firmly: “How many timesdo we have to state our position  We leave on the same terms as the rest of the UK – that means no sea border, whether customs or regulatory.“It’s a red line and we mean it.”Legacy Scandal: ‘No group even claimed the loyalist bomb in Cavan that killed my sister’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

He was on an IRA operation in  when he was arrested with a weapon used in the Kingsmills Massacre in south Armagh, during which ten Protestant civilians were shot by the IRA.A legal challenge against the name was taken in  by the family of Kenneth Worton, one of those killed. This week DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance councillors on the council voted to resolve the matter by selling off the land, a move hotly opposed by Sinn Fein.Colin Worton, whose mother Bea brought the legal challenge, gave the news “a cautious welcome”.“It has been deemed to be surplus to requirement - but the name still has to go,” he said. “If it is sold to another public body the name should be changed.”Victims campaigner Willie Frazer, who supported the Wortons, also welcomed the news. “From the very start of the judicial review we thought the council would sell it,” he said. “But the High Court has stipulated that it must be sold at the proper market value. If a community group buys it they cannot get any public fundingthey try to retain the name. If it is renamed after that we can do no more.”Newry and Mourne DUP MLA William Irwin also welcomed the decision.“People of every background have been appalled that a children’s playpark was named in honour of someone involved in sectarian murder,” he said. “The disposal of this land may finally see a conclusion to a saga which should have been dealt with many years ago. “Opportunities to remove this grossly offensive name were repeatedly refused and even the legal action brought by a victim of terrorism was not respected by some councillors.”This may allow the issue to be finally resolved, he said, adding that the DUP would continue to monitor it closely.Independent unionist councillor Henry Reilly also backed the sale.“It’s important to note that this decision is on the back of an independent investigation and report produced by a internationally recognised company that specialises in public authority play strategies,” he said. “The park is in the wrong place and offers a low ‘play value’ for children and the obvious decision for the council to take is close the facility and offer it to other public bodies like the NIHE that desperately needs to develop social housing in the area.”Sinn Fein councillor Liz Kimmins proposed the decision to sell be reversed and the local community consulted instead, but this was voted down by the other parties.Legacy consultation: Sinn Fein’s response ‘work of fantasy and delusion’Primark: we are doing all we can on safety cordon Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"She told the News Letter: “The SDLP and other parties have always wished to remove the name of Raymond McCreesh Park and are now attempting to do this through the disposal of the park.“Sinn Féin opposed this based on concerns raised by local residents and community groups in the area, and on Monday night I proposed that the council reverse this decision and instead carry out a full community consultation to find out what the people of the area want for the future of the park.“This issue has not been resolved.

Timothy Johnston giving evidence to the RHI Inquiry on Thursday Mr Johnston rejected that and told the inquiry that he had no interest in relation to RHI or role in cost controls.But an email which Mr Cairns gave to the inquiry on Wednesday night shows that he was in contact with Mr Johnston about RHI. On August , Mr Cairns emailed him in relation to another renewable energy issue on which they were jointly working, the NIRO electricity subsidy.Mr Cairns went on to say: “We also need to get a catch up on renewable heat. If we are to deviate from GB policy, it will require a ministerial direction [the nuclear option for a minister].”Inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin said it seemed “a pretty clear suggestion that somebody somewhere was saying ‘don’t put [cost controls] in’.Mr Johnston faced sustained questioning about the topic, with barrister Donal Lunny saying that it “seems to assume a degree of knowledge” about the issue, with the language being “cryptic” to the uninitiated. Mr Johnston said Mr Cairns may have assumed he had more knowledge than he had.When askedhe read the email, Mr Johnston initially said that he “probably skimmed it”. Sir Patrick put it to him that “it’s not a long email ... so skimming it means you probably read it ”Mr Johnston said: “Yes, I thinkyou’re pushing me – I can’t be absolutely % certain.”Sir Patrick asked why Mr Johnston had not instantly phoned or gone down the corridor to ask “what on earth are you telling me about ‘deviation’ for  I haven’t said anything about this. You must have got the wrong person”.Mr Johnston said: “I certainly ... have no sense that I did do that ... I have no sense that at the time I paid a lot of attention to it.”Sir Patrick said the “probable” explanation was that Mr Cairns referred to RHI as he did because there had been an exchange with Mr Johnston on the issue such as the one where he is alleged to have said no to cost controls. Mr Johnston said that he had denied that. But Sir Patrick said: “On this evidence, that [Mr Cairns’ account] fits.”Mr Johnston was asked “had you forgotten about that communication until you saw that email today ” He said: “Yes. Absolutely. And not only that, but I mean it doesn’t massively jog my memory ... I take that email to be ‘Tim, you’ve been away on your holidays, you’ve come back, you’ve a lot of other stuff on we need to talk about RHI’.”Legacy Scandal: ‘No group even claimed the loyalist bomb in Cavan that killed my sister’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Dame Una O’Brien said: “But Mr Johnston, it doesn’t actually say that ... If Mr Cairns’s sentence said as you’ve described, I could get that. But it actually doesn’t say that, does it “On any common sense reading, it implies some degree of previous engagement on it – ‘ we are going to deviate’. There’s a gap between what you’re saying it seems to be saying and what it is actually saying.”Mr Johnston said: “I can see that. All I can set out for you is as I both recall it and believe it to be the case that it wasn’t a case that I had ever suggested at any [time] let’s not have tarf controls, or let’s delay them ...”Mr Lunny put it to him that – given that he now accepts he had forgotten about that exchange – there may have been other occasions where RHI was mentioned.Mr Johnston said: “I can’t rule that out. I can’t rule that out. All I can say to you very definitively is that I’m absolutely clear – because it would stick in my memory –I had given the guys to believe, or pushed the notion, or encouraged them down the route of saying ‘there’s not going to be cost controls’ I’m absolutely clear that wasn’t the case.”try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Initially under the baton of Clford Bunford and later conducted by Douglas Baxter, the choir performed many of the major works of the choral repertoire and several less well known works. Following Douglas retirement in , the choir began to suffer a decline in numbers, which led to a ersying of the repertoire.The choir was rebranded as Barry Community Choir in  and, under the leadership of conductor, Emma Arscott, the membership has begun to increase again.The choir meets in Crossway Church in Barry on Wednesday evenings and all are welcome to join. There are no auditions and no previous choir experience is needed.The concert saw many people turn up to enjoy the music alongside a iety of refreshments.Dafydd Jones, administrator of the Parish of All Saints Church and organiser of the Music at Lunchtime programme of concerts, said the concert was a great way to start the season.He said: \"An enjoyable time was had by all - audience and performers who have, by the way, expressed a willingness, nay an enthusiasm, to come back for amatch next year.\"After welcoming the audience and thanking them for their attendance, I introduced the Town Mayor, Cllr Jon Luxton who spoke briefly about Music at Lunchtime, the Barry Community Choir and All Saints Church also expressed a desire to come back for other concerts in the future.\"The choir performed a most enjoyable pot-pourri of songs from the shows amongst many others and ended up with a foot-tapping medley of World War One favourites. All in all, a heart-warming programme of music, appreciated by everyone.\"This yearrsquos autumn programme of recitals at All Saints Church continues throughout October and November with an exciting mix of vocal and instrumental soloists and ensembles.All Saints Church is accessible to the disabled and the elderly and also boasts creche facilities.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It may be sort of a melancholy sound, but really itrsquos also the chimes of freedom, and people love to hear it.Mr Pound described the chimes as the ldquorhythm of Westminster le and said they were the ldquosoundtrack of his le and work.ldquoItrsquos the single most impressive sound for London. Itrsquos the one that is more emblematic of London than any other sound you could imagine, he said.Listening to the bells ring out as he stood on Westminster Bridge, Mr Pound said: ldquoIt actually sounds a bit fresher. That sounds to me like the key of E, but earlier on the chimes seemed to be in F.ldquoMaybe I have a tin ear, but that sounds a little bit sharper and a little bit fresher, but on the other hand, maybe shersquos had a scrub up.The Elizabeth Tower, home to the Great Clock and the Great Bell ndash known as Big Ben ndash is undergoing a complex programme of conservation works to safeguard it for generations to come.Parliamentrsquos team of clock mechanics temporarily disconnected Big Ben and the quarter bells from the clock mechanism and lowered the weights to the base of the tower in order to provide a safe environment for the people working in the Elizabeth Tower.A bespoke electric mechanism has been built to power the kg striking hammer in order to ensure the Great Bell can mark Remembrance Sunday and New Yearrsquos Eve.The Great Bell , weighs . tonnes and is struck with a kg hammer. It produces musical note E when struck. It measures ., across and is .m high.The Clock Tower was renamed the Elizabeth Tower in , to honour the Queenrsquos Diamond Jubilee.There are  steps to the belfry in the tower.The Elizabeth Tower was constructed using , cubic metres of brick and  cubic metres of stone, which were transported to Westminster by river.Each clock dial features a cast iron frame holding  pieces of pot opal glass, which is being replaced.As the clock mechanism itself has been dismantled for conservation work, a modern electric motor will drive the clock hands until the Great Clock is reinstated.The clock began keeping time for the nation on  May ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Big Ben bongs for first time since New Year article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  comments        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg --\"Most popularMost commentedLoading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos nowMost popularCommentedLoading...Read more         ,CommentsSorry, an error occurred.Thank YouYour complaint has been sent to the site administrators.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentContact UsPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartDatingTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies dinner, with sponsor AL Goodbody, saw dozens of those making the list attend a grand gala dinner at the Ulster Museum in Belfast. They heard from guest speaker Andrea Leadsom, who restated the Governments commitment to no hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and its determination to not have any customs border between NI and the rest of the UK. \"I am fully aware of your concerns as business leaders in relation to Brexit, particularly in relation to the border,\" she told her audience at the Ulster Museum. \"I know the success of many of your businesses, and your day-to-day lives, relies on frictionless trade and travel across the border. Let me assure you that we dont want this arrangement to change when we leave the EU.” The event also heard from Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew, who said companies across Northern Ireland were exhausted due to the deadlock at Stormont, and remain concerned over what damage a ‘no deal’ Brexit scenario could have on their bottom line. “It’s quite clear that anything that leaves us with a ‘no deal’ scenari, in simplistic terms, is not going to work, or be acceptable to you, and thousands of other businesses across Northern Ireland,” he said. And speaking about the lack of an Executive, he said: “Everyone here knows it’s not acceptable. Everyone here is tired talking about it, and wants it sorted now, rather than when it’s convenient for those who are supposed to be here to govern us.” Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said that since the Top  two years ago, little had progressed in how Brexit would be dealt with. “We would all have hoped that by now we would have some sense of what the future business environment might look like. But, sadly, that is not the case. “Every day at AL Goodbody, we’re getting calls from companies of all sizes, right across the Island of Ireland and beyond who are seeking some sense of clarity on Brexit-related legal matters. “That means, every single day, we hear that NI Plc is still grappling with that same ‘great unknown’ Mark spoke of at this event two years ago. \"And when you add to this the political deadlock and over  days without a local government, its no wonder our clients and the wider business community find ourselves in a very challenging situation.” The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies magazine is the leading list of the region’s top businesses, ranked by turnover. Overall, pre-tax profits among those making the list grew by %, rising to £.m And turnover among the Top  increased by %, to just shy of £bn. Moy Park kept the top spot, for the seventh year running, with turnover of £.bn. And since publication, that turnover has grown further still.

For reference, this is one of probably more than a dozen trips I’ve paid to the country in the last decade.Antwerp is an accessible port city, known for its diamond quarter. Its main train station is also something to behold. Listed as one of the world’s most beautul stations, it fuses century-old architecture with grand ceilings, along with its multi-storey renovation in .The main town squares in Belgium’s northern cities each have a familiar style, with Antwerp’s Grote Markt akin to the capital’s larger Grand-Place. These spots are worth a dander around on a hot day, but expect to pay tourist prices at the raft of outside eateries which scatter the perimeter.Temperatures in Belgium tend to fall in line with the south of England – a warmer climate than Northern Ireland, with the mercury hitting the late s during the summer.On this latest trip, it was a high of C and a low of a little over -odd at night. Scorching, but with a crisp Belgian strong pale ale in hand, that’s all made right .In Antwerp, and Brussels, you’ll find a raft of beers from the six Belgian Trappist monasteries – highlights include Rochefort , Westmalle Tripel and the highly sought-after Westvleteren  –  and those from the more-modern producers, such as Brussels Beer Project and De Struise, fairly readily across the capital, and the surrounding areas.Frites Atelier is a popular spot for high-end Belgian frites, topped with items such as truffle mayonnaise, Indonesian peanut sauce and a stunning traditional Flemish stew. It’s normally bunged, but the system ensures you aren’t waiting long – and it’s definitely worth the visit.One of Belgium’s beer-known beer spots can also be found a short distance from the city centre. The Kulminator is a somewhat eccentric spot, run by a husband and we team. It has a traditional brown cafe feel, cluttered, but has the most extensive range of aged Belgian beers I’ve come across. To continue the beer theme, we headed to the small town of Lot – before heading on to Brussels for the rest of the stay.It’s home to Drie Fonteinen – one of Belgium’s most-revered sour beer producers and blenders. A couple of hours well spent with one-off brews and vintage offerings, paired with a platter of beer pate, cheese, bread and pottekeis – a fresh cheese spread, somewhere between a smooth cottage cheese and sour cream. Now, in Brussels there are more than a few great spots for both a wide-range of top-end Belgian brews, and a warm atmosphere.The central La Mort Subite is a grand cafe located close to Grand-Place, with a solid range of beer, while Delirium Cafe – known for having the largest selection of beer in the world – is worth a visit. If you’re going as a beer geek, peruse the vast ,+ bottle range and find something you can’t get back home, but be aware than it’s become a tourist mecca – with backpacking students filling it in the busy periods to get a filter-clad snap for their timeline.Moeder Lambic has two spots – one central and one further south. Both are superb, modern Belgian beer bars, with a strong tap selection and the best meat and cheese board in the city.Brussels has a couple of breweries in its city centre, but Cantillon is the place to visit for those who are either fully immersed in beer, or want to expand their palate.You can also eat well in Brussels, with lots of spots serving good meat, cheese and pate, with bistro fare such as Flemish carbonnade and rabbit cooked in gueuze beer. There’s also an undercurrent of ‘all-you-can-eat’ rib appreciation, with Amadeo – and similar spots in other cities such as Ghent. We also opted for the beer-friendly and cosy Nuetnigenough. Starters and mains include black pudding with gueuze beer sauce, veal meatballs and rabbit fricassee with gueuze.For seafood, the bustling outdoor Noordzee is a great place to stop off for very fresh mussels, prawns and crab.It’s dficult to know whether the city’s reasonable hotel prices, and flight costs –booked far enough in advance – are in part due to the terror attacks in . But Brussels is a city moving on from that particularly dark period in its modern history.We stayed at the five-star pole – a grand Art Deco hotel with spacious rooms. On this occasion we paid little over £ a night.Aside from places to eat and drink, the city centre is a very walkable place – it’s the sort of place that merits exploration. The city also boasts a thriving jazz centre, and it’s worth checking online to see what’s happening during your stay.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete.jpg","title":"meat merchant to expand into republic","story":"Posted on Monday October  by John Mulgrew Meat mogul Peter Hannan says he will expand the retail arm of his successful Co Down business into the Republic this year, Ulster Business can reveal.The Kildare-born businessman, who runs Hannan Meats in Moira, also believes that, following the negative outlook for the economy in the wake of the vote for Brexit, that the UK’s exit from the EU won’t happen.In an interview with Ulster Business, Mr Hannan said: “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit.

A company linked to Newry man Brian McConville, who runs the successful MJM Group, has submitted plans for the extension and refurbishment of  –  Donegall Square East. The works include a new extension, with plans for commercial use at the basement, ground floor and four floors, and office accommodation on the first to third, fth and sixth. A design statement from architects Hamilton says the design intention is “to remove any unsympathetic additions and alterations within the listed buildings, retain the original plan form of the buildings, and conserve all extant historic features”. That includes ornate cornices, ceiling roses and moulded timbers “all of which survive in relatively good condition throughout the building”. The design document says the “new work within the historic structure will follow conservation principles of maximum retention of historic fabric, minimum intervention, reversibility, honest, clarity and sustainability”. Brian McConville’s MJM Group is one of Northern Ireland’s fastest growing companies. MJM Marine is MJM Group’s main business, based in Newry, and headed by founder Brian McConville. It was set up in  by Mr McConville, and carries out work for many of the world’s top cruise liners, including Star Cruises. The fit-out specialist is seldom out of the headlines, whether it’s landed new contracts or winning awards. The company has ersied and grown in influence, with Mr McConville one of just two Northern Ireland business leaders joining Prime Minister Theresa May on an international trade mission to China.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/group_v2_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland building long term business partnerships","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by Ulster Business Eugene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group, Bank of Irelands Gavin Kennedy, Bridgene McKeever of McKeever Hotel Group alongside Eamon McCay, Frylite, and Brian Connolly, Pinnacle Bank of Ireland UK has been backing Northern Ireland businesses across the generations. Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

Alan was a little out, but not by much, writes Justin Rush.  The automation of processes has been one of the hottest discussion topics in . Given that recruitment of staff is a tremendously time intensive process, and one which requires consistency it must surely be a perfect candidate for automation  Well yes… and no. Automation can assist a great deal, but it can’t do everything, not yet anyway.  It is important to know, candidates that are active in today’s employment market are more and more accustomed to using automated chatbots as part of the recruitment process. Non-human involvement equates to zero bias, and therefore reinforces fairness. This is a massive plus point. In a survey by Allegis, % of candidates stated they were comfortable interacting with AI and recruitment chatbots in the early stages of the application process. An even larger proportion - % - were comfortable with chatbots taking care of interview scheduling and preparation.  So what benefits can your business gain from appointing a Recruit-bot Streamlining the applicant journey, by ensuring consistency in the recruitment process and asking screening questions and answering FAQs.Ranking applications, this can be undertaken fairly and quickly based upon candidate submissions. As a result shortlisting is quick and clean.Scheduling assessments and tests, this can be straightforward and without human involvement.   responses, your bot will can exist across your website and all social channels simultaneously.  Your recruitment is now ‘always on’ engaging with potential hires.Repetitive tasks eliminated, creating reports, sending on-line forms or adding candidates to a management system can be a thing of the past.  So automation can really help, especially when volume of applications is a potential issue and you need consistency, or when you are recruiting globally across time zones and don’t want to miss out on a potential inquiry.  Some issues do still remain, despite the efforts of articial intelligence to do it all. In the main, these are the human factors, for example, the assessment of certain competencies that are essential for a job such as team-working.   At present, bots aren’t quite ready to handle the intricate aspects of the recruitment process that require patience and finesse. Answering more specic questions that more specialist professionals may want to ask about a job opportunity, selling the career opportunity or negotiation of salary and terms. These aspects are not part of any readily available algorithm… yet.
