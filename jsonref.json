It was a good relationship and we spent many times at the dance studio.\u0027We had some tit-for-tats at the dance school which caused small problems at home. Some dance partners had my full attention but it would take its toll on me and there was a little bit of jealousy.\u0027She wasn’t quite happy that I had to split my time.

This one felt right.\u0027Recalling the night of the split he added: ‘There was an awards ceremony and we each won awards for the highest marks in the school. I drank alcohol in the bath before we went out and at the ceremony. As the night went on, the bar was on last orders and Catherine said to me that she wanted to go home and didn’t feel well. She had just bought a bottle and wasn’t going to drink it so I wanted to take it with us.\u0027But she took the pint off me and said she had enough and we were going home. I was embarrassed that she took the drink off me and I was slurring my words a bit.\u0027But I didn’t like getting orders that we had to go home. I said something along the lines of you are only f***ing 21 years old. I was annoyed and upset. I was frustrated that I am 36 and an adult and didn’t need babysitting - I felt insulted. I don’t recall saying the words little bitch to her.\u0027I was distraught with myself with how I spoke to her. I was trying to fight for Catherine. I was not abusive towards her in messages. I was sad. I did everything on reason to show my depth of feeling for her. I just wanted to sort it out and fix things.\u0027I wanted my life in Oldham with Catherine. My job was here, the dance school was here - we set up a home and planned to stay there.

The 105-day slog almost broke him – but it restored his faith in a volatile, fractured EuropeOn 27 April this year, Michal Iwanowski left his house in Cardiff to walk to his home village of Mokrzeszów in Poland. Carrying British and Polish passports and wearing a T-shirt bearing the word “Polska”, he began his 1,200-mile journey east, sticking as closely as possible to a straight line he had drawn on a map. Over 105 days, it would take him through Wales, England, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the Czech Republic.Along the way, Iwanowski posted a diary of his journey on Instagram, recording his thoughts, encounters and impressions of the landscape, the images and words unfolding as a meditation on belonging and transience. “I saw the project as a way of thinking about the idea of home,” he says, “not least because it would take me from the place I have lived in for 18 years to the place I come from. And I would be doing it at a time when Brexit had made the idea of home, identity and belonging a very politicised subject.”Iwanowski had been thinking about walking to Poland for several years, after being confronted in 2008 by graffiti scrawled on a wall in the Roath area of Cardiff, where he lives. “Go Home, Polish,” it read. He has since appropriated the line for the project’s title. “I wasn’t shocked, but it stayed with me,” he says. “I started thinking, ‘Should I be really going home or am I already home?’ As Brexit became more volatile, I found myself thinking more about what you might call the human dilemma of home: how we can, if we have to, make a home anywhere and nowhere.”The photographer is no stranger to long, arduous journeys on foot. In August 2013, he set out from Kaluga to retrace the steps of his grandfather Tolek, who escaped from a Russian gulag with his brother Wiktor in 1945. Travelling under cover of darkness, they made it home to Poland in three months. For his project, Clear of People, Iwanowski traced the same 1,360-mile route following a map Wiktor had drawn. In freezing temperatures, he walked eight hours a day, staying in motels to thaw out and take notes. It was an often isolated journey through timeless terrain. “In the forest,” he says, “it’s possible everything looks the same now as it did 70 years ago.”He wanted to make this latest journey more performative. To this end, he often appears in the images, sometimes as himself, sometimes as a generic wanderer lost in an unfamiliar landscape. In one self-portrait, he clings to a tree as if in danger from a threat just out of the frame. In another, he tries in vain to squeeze between two concrete posts – the immigrant’s experience distilled.Central to the project was his desire to meet people. It was not always easy. In France, he did not really connect with anyone. In Germany, an enraged local chased him off an allotment he had wandered on to to ask for directions. Most of the time, though, it was the sheer energy-sapping doggedness of the undertaking – “the drudgery and sweat” – that tested him as he trudged wearily through often empty, unchanging landscapes. On 8 July, his Instagram post read: “On Wednesday I crashed and decided to throw in the towel.” For a few hours, he sat at the side of a road, dehydrated and exhausted, having thrown his rucksack into the bushes in a tantrum. “It lasted a few hours,” he wrote. “I got back up.”It wasn’t all about endurance, though, a fact reflected in some of his more humorous self-portraits. “There was definitely a madness that crept in, a dreamscape element. You go slightly loopy, which is why the diary is important. It’s keeping a thread, both visually and in terms of your thoughts. You realise it is the little poetic thoughts and observations that mean a lot.”Iwanowski’s long walk ultimately proved both cathartic and life-affirming. “I think I have an ingrained kindness,” he says. “But, like many people, I had become more cynical of late. The experience has banished that cynicism. People are OK. In fact, they are often gloriously generous.”Although he is an infectiously upbeat inidual, I had not expected such a remark. “Me neither,” he says, laughing. “Look, I know I am a white male and that I passed quickly though towns and villages, where I was not perceived as a threat. But my experience was so overwhelmingly positive that it has made me question everything I read in the media about the hardening of attitudes that Brexit has supposedly provoked. I think that a few loud, extreme voices dominate the debate, but ordinary people are stoical or confused – and perhaps a little angry. But they are also decent.”In France and Germany, he encountered “so many people who were utterly baffled by Britain’s decision to leave the European Union”. The same was true in parts of Wales and England he passed through – including Chepstow, Reading, Folkestone and Dover. “I tried to engage people by telling them I was an artist and explaining the project,” he says. “With most, there was an immediate sigh of relief, followed by the words, ‘Fuck Brexit’ – often from those I felt would be staunch leavers. I met a guy in full hunting gear who told me he was devastated by the Brexit vote. I stayed with a posh banker lady from London who had attended a funeral the day after the referendum. She said, ‘I felt like I went to two funerals – one for a friend and one for my country.’”Howewer, he inevitably glimpsed signs of the new Fortress Europe: border police in Dunkirk, for example, questioning “men whose dark features made them suspicious”. When he finally reached his village, Iwanowski was welcomed by a party of locals near his home. “They had a banner and everything, but it looked a bit like a funeral procession – save for one lady who had dressed in bright glowing polyester and was wearing a wig. It was as if they had walked out of a weird August Sander photograph, in which people are waiting for something to happen but they are not sure what.” Did it make him feel homesick? “In a way. But I was laughing uncontrollably at the absurdity of it all.”Has this odyssey changed his way of thinking about home? “It confirmed something.

So the Turner prize brings all that home.”It is also the first Turner prize show to feature works that are all films, with visitors entering a large room with soft chairs, off which there are four dark entrances to the films.The prize was created 34 years ago and regularly upsets traditionalists in the debate about what precisely can be defined as art.This year jurors have been drawn to serious, political artists. With one work entitled Volume Eleven (A Flaw in the Algorithm of Cosmopolitanism), it is not for people who want a quick scoot around some pretty things.One of the contenders stretches the definition of what an “artist” is in that Forensic Architecture describe themselves as an international research agency.Forensic Architecture investigates international crime and injustice and is a collective of architects, film-makers, archaeologists, investigative journalists, lawyers and scientists.It is exhibiting its investigations surrounding the Bedouin communities of the NaqabNegev region of southern Israel – specifically, the events of 18 January 2017, when an attempt by police to clear an unrecognised Bedouin village resulted in the death of two people.Naeem Mohaiemen is showing works including a fictional film, Tripoli Cancelled, which follows the daily routine of a man who spends a decade alone living in an abandoned airport.Charlotte Prodger is showing her autobiographical queer identity film BRIDGIT, which she filmed on her iPhone over the course of a year.The fourth artist, Luke Willis Thompson, is showing three works on 35mm film.Some might accuse this year’s Turner prize of being heavy going but Farquharson said there was humour to be found.He pointed to Mohaiemen’s Tripoli Cancelled film, depicting “a crazy Kafkaesque bureaucratic nightmare, which in itself is funny and absurd”.Farquharson added: “What is remarkable is that so many different languages of film making are represented.”The prize changed its rules in 2017 to allow any artist working in the UK to be eligible, removing the upper age restriction of 40. That allowed Lubaina Himid, then 63, to become the oldest winner in the prize’s history last December.This year’s exhibition opens at Tate Britain on Wednesday. The £25,000 winner will be named on 4 December at a ceremony broadcast live on the BBC.• Turner Prize 2018: 26 September to 6 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77c868a4ca63ecb1b05c863aefe8c5b38808832/0_67_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589b88bd8b30831e525366d53c4d44b7","title":"get some perspective hong kong high rises in pictures","story":"Photographer Peter Stewart has always felt drawn to the urban density and scale of big cities, and it’s a common theme through much his photography. ‘I like to create images that often lack a single point of interest, with the visual hook, so to speak being the repetition of patterns or shapes, with lots of fine details that hopefully draw the eyes of viewers to warrant inspection up close’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5163bc49397ec68f89d555723ed7b9d3eda7a453/0_347_3529_2118/master/3529.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cb87041915f3db597178e6c041714c2","title":"american companies buying the best of britain on the cheap","story":"Value of deals involving US firms acquiring UK businesses more than doublesUS firms are taking advantage of the cheap pound to snap up some of Britain’s most successful businesses at bargain prices, according to the latest mergers and acquisitions data.The value of deals involving US companies buying UK businesses more than doubled to £79bn in 2017-18 from £36.8bn in the previous year.The low value of sterling, which last week slumped to $1.30 in the wake of Theresa May’s post-Salzburg statement, has given American buying power a boost and allowed US firms to outbid rivals.Music app Shazam, which was bought by Apple for £299m, was among the many fast-growing UK-based firms that accountancy firm Moore Stephens said were bought by US rivals or private equity firms.Figures for the current year are likely to show another rise in activity following the plan by Coca-Cola to spend £3.9bn purchasing coffee business Costa Coffee from Whitbread and the announcement that US insurance broker Marsh \u0026amp McLennan will buy UK insurance company Jardine Lloyd Thompson in a £4.3bn deal.Moore Stephens said US firms, unlike their European counterparts, had shrugged off Brexit concerns.“This has been in part due to the devaluation of sterling since 2014, making British businesses comparatively cheaper than many of their foreign competitors,” it said.“Brexit has also been perceived more negatively on the continent by politicians, business groups and the media than in the US, making European businesses more cautious about acquiring UK companies,” the accountancy firm added.Many analysts had expected US firms to cut back on foreign buyouts following tax reforms brought in by the Trump administration last year. New rules encourage firms to repatriate cash they hold overseas. They also offer incentives to buy and invest in domestic firms. Previously, cash held outside the US had been used to fund overseas mergers and acquisitions.Moore Stephens said the large number of US buyers eyeing UK firms revealed that American business bosses were on the hunt for innovative and well-run businesses.It said: “The confidence that US investors have placed in the UK is indicative of the underlying strength of UK businesses and the openness of its economy.”Other firms purchased last year include UK-based social business network Huddle, which was acquired by private equity firm TurnRiver Capital for £284m, and trading and investment software company Fidessa, which was taken over by Temenos Group AG for £1.3bn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02824a4aeb73660e086e5c63704fa1056ded03ad/0_16_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dde7f0eb8405f4d90002312d98cc4e68","title":"brexit chequers salzburg irish sea customs union","story":"The rejection of the Chequers plan at Salzburg was no surprise – the EU will never accept a fudge on the Irish borderDonald Tusk’s clear rejection of Theresa May’s Chequers plan at the Salzburg summit yesterday should not come as a surprise. The most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that it is not a negotiation, and never has been. Blessed with superior size, wealth and power, the EU has been able to dictate the framework and substance of the talks, and has refused any deviation from its red lines.The second most important lesson of the Brexit negotiation is that the EU will prioritise its economic and political cohesion above all else. That cohesion rests on two key outcomes: an unided single market and an open border on the island of Ireland.It is these principles that have led us to Salzburg. The EU will not accept the Chequers plan, which proposes a single market in goods but not in services, capital or people. It will also not accept any possibility of border infrastructure in Ireland, which is anathema to Dublin and, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, presents a credible risk of sectarian violence. That has duly paved the way for the Brexit endgame, which EU negotiator Michel Barnier has now confirmed: there will be a border for goods in the Irish Sea.The EU does not, however, want to antagonise or humiliate the UK, and has scrambled to defuse the drama of this development. Barnier stresses that most checks between Britain and Northern Ireland will take place in offices and warehouses, and only live animals and food products will need to be examined at ports themselves. But no amount of diplomatic politesse can conceal Brexit’s reality: one part of the UK will be economically split from another.Theresa May effectively guaranteed this impasse last December, when she agreed the Irish backstop. The backstop guarantees, as a last resort, Northern Ireland’s alignment with Ireland on the customs union and single market to ensure the free flow of goods. Northern Ireland would be permitted to retain the single market just in goods because the Good Friday agreement depends on it. But no such exemptions would ever be open to the rest of the UK. Although the EU was too coy to admit it at the time, this always meant that the whole UK would have to commit to the prospect of staying in the full single market and customs union, or else concede the erection of trade barriers within its territory.If May had been armed with political judgment, or merely cognisant of reality, she would have prepared the British people – and government – for that concession. She has instead wasted nine months denying she ever made it. It comes as little surprise that the EU has now taken the initiative where the UK refused.The prime minister has boxed herself in with promises she cannot keep. She insists on the ability to strike UK-only trade deals and end free movement of people, while refusing to accept its consequences. In Salzburg she announced “the idea that I should assent to the legal separation of the United Kingdom into two customs territories is not credible”, but failed to acknowledge the lack of credibility in any other option. She resembles a desperate fugitive who urgently needs to escape a building but instead keeps inexplicably locking herself inside it.The most problematic consequence of the EU’s proposals is one that Brussels is most loath to spell out. This is not simply about checking goods. If Northern Ireland permanently operates a different customs regime from the rest of the UK and implements EU tariffs, then Northern Ireland must be exempt from any future UK trade deals. But it is almost inconceivable that the DUP – let alone the UK parliament – would ever agree to such a scenario. The DUP leader in the Commons, Nigel Dodds, has referred even to the checking of goods as “separating Northern Ireland from Great Britain”.Noisiest in their opposition are Tory Brexiters, not least David Davis and Boris Johnson, both of whom quit the cabinet in protest. They argue that the promise to maintain a common rulebook for goods and other continued alignment will mean a post-Brexit UK is tied to the EU without having a say on future rules, rather than being a free-trading independent nation.Labour has also disparaged the proposal, expressing deep scepticism about the so-called facilitated customs arrangement system.Brussels has sought to stay positive, but has deep concerns about elements of the plan viewed as overly pick-and-mix, and thus potentially incompatible with EU principles.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, says he opposes both the customs plan and the idea of alignment for goods. He also makes plain his contention that the Chequers plan contains no workable idea for the Ireland-Northern Ireland border.But at the same time the EU has been careful to not entirely dismiss the proposals, raising the possibility it could accept some adapted version.Officially, May and her cabinet, though even here the backing can seem lukewarm at times. Asked about Chequers, the home secretary, Sajid Javid, said it was the government’s plan “right now”, indicating alternative ideas could be considered.Even May’s allies concede it will be a hugely difficult task to get the plan through parliament. Damian Green, the PM’s close friend and former de fact deputy, described the process as “walking a narrow path with people chucking rocks at us from both sides”.On the remain side of the Conservatives, the former education secretary Justine Greening called the Chequers plan “more unpopular than the poll tax”, saying May should start again from scratch.If anything can save the plan – and it’s an outside shot – it will be a combination of the hugely tight timetable and the fact that, as yet, no one else has yet produced a plan with a better chance of being accepted by parliament.On 20 September, an informal gathering in Salzburg, Austria, will provide a snapshot of current EU thinking. Then, 10 days later, the Conservative conference could show the Chequers plan is holed below the waterline.If it survives these tests, the proposals will then reach the crucial EU summit Brussels on 18 October, with something final needed, at the very latest, in the next two months. PETER WALKERMay consequently has two tasks. First, she must determine whether her government would survive opposition to an effective border in the Irish Sea from the DUP and Commons. But more important, she must decide whether she values the economic integrity of the UK more than the ability to unilaterally change Britain’s tariffs and end migration rights for Polish plumbers.The EU, for its part, knows it holds all the cards and recognises the danger of giving ground. Its priority is to accommodate Dublin, not London. It also concludes that a government so determined to leave must believe it can look after itself. Brussels has no reason or incentive to make any better offer.The government has never understood the Brexit process and therefore has always botched it. It expects the EU to treat the UK both as an equally powerful third country, and as a member state still deserving the EU’s protection. It is neither. And so in a battle of red lines, the UK will lose. That is the most brutal lesson of all.• Jonathan Lis is deputy director of the thinktank British Influence"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e74e3130293264e9dc49f54d5e27301ac41f06/0_0_4537_2724/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188628b0b48c85af41c291785c19a278","title":"european language brexit britain","story":"For someone who occasionally seems unsure whether their wife is Japanese or Chinese, Jeremy Hunt seems to speak pretty good Japanese.Unless bits of it were Chinese, obviously. Given the way things have gone lately for Theresa May’s government we probably shouldn’t rule anything out, but let’s just assume the Tokyo audience he addressed in their native tongue this week wasn’t just being polite and that he did actually deliver the whole speech in the correct language.Lately there has been some tinkering with grade boundaries to encourage uptake. But while mathematicians and scientists have gone to great lengths to popularise subjects once seen as geeky or intimidatingly difficult, there has been no concerted push behind French or Spanish.And if we’re honest, Britain’s solid international reputation for being rubbish at languages isn’t just down to the kids. How many of us slogged through years of irregular verbs and asking the way to the station, only to be reduced in middle age to fumbled holiday conversations in shops and frantic pointing?But watching Hunt reminded me of something I’ve been wondering for a while, which is whether the prospect of leaving Europe will finally make learning a language feel less like a slog and more like a thrillingly subversive act one great defiant two fingers to everything Brexit Britain stands for.Languages are lovely things to learn in their own right, of course, if you’re so minded living, breathing entities that weave in and out of each other, exchanging sounds and words and ideas. But they’re also one of the purest forms of soft power. Speaking to someone in their own tongue is a disarming act, a gesture of empathy and respect. If you’re not actually very good at it then in some ways all the better at least it’s obvious you’re making an effort, which is why typing furiously into Google Translate doesn’t quite have the same effect.Eventually, once they’re good enough to stop occasionally churning out scrambled garbage, robot translators will presumably put human translators out of business. But they’ll still struggle to convey what a human switching between languages does, which is a fundamental willingness to put oneself out in order to put someone else at ease. Speaking foreign languages is about meeting people halfway, building bridges and accepting differences – all skills sorely in need of some practice, judging by the current tone of public\u0026nbspconversation.But above all, languages open so many doors to understanding. There are few better ways of grasping why so many British negotiating gambits flop in Brussels than reading a German newspaper’s take on them. (I still have fond memories of sneaking into French government briefings at EU summits, the gist of which was usually that the French had conclusively won all the arguments, to compare them with the Downing Street version in which oddly enough it was generally the British who had triumphed.)And even to understand the construction of a language can shed light on a different way of thinking. What seems like basic politeness in English sounds almost weirdly apologetic if translated directly into anything from Spanish to Hebrew, while people translating directly the other way can sound rude, abrupt or stilted to English ears even when that’s not remotely the intention. A basic knowledge of how someone’s first language works goes a long way to avoiding small, grating cultural misunderstandings when they’re using their second.It’s true that English remains the lingua franca of big tourist resorts and business conferences. But the trouble with grandly relying on everyone else to speak your language is that it can make you oddly vulnerable. What stubborn monoglots often don’t realise is that they will only ever hear as much as the people around them want them to hear that private conversations and whispered asides will remain a closed book. If you really want to take back control, then learn a language, and with it the small covert thrill of eavesdropping on conversations that people don’t realise you can understand.But it’s Brexit that could turn an abstract intellectual pleasure into a small private act of defiance, both for grieving remainers and for those liberal leavers who actually meant what they said about leaving the EU but not leaving Europe. For those who can’t bear to see Britain defined by belligerent isolationism, who don’t want the rest of the world to think that this is who we are, then one tiny but practical way of showing it is brushing up on a European language and making a determined effort to use it. Cold comfort, obviously, for those who would rather Britain never left at all. But if the great rupture is coming, then we still have a choice over how culturally isolated we become. The least we can do is keep talking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2324170e9ea60f30f8c0cb54ee32718d67090cad/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=768bc0eb360dee42b509b7cd1c496918","title":"tesco jacks little englandism cornish camembert jacks","story":"The new Tesco chain prides itself on its British products – but it’s really selling the myth of post-Brexit self-sufficiencyJack’s dependence on Europe goes deeper than its shelf-stackers.

The president is sponsored by fast-food chain Carl’s Jr., and crops are failing because the fields are irrigated with energy drinks. The film was abandoned by its studio and largely ignored at the box office, but its subsequent cult status might be in danger once again, this time from the overbearing reality of present events.Researchers from Beijing University and Yale School of Health published research last month showing that people who live in major cities – which is, today, most of us – are not only suffering from increases in respiratory illnesses and other chronic conditions due to air pollution, but are losing our cognitive functions. The study showed that high pollution levels lead to significant drops in test scores in language and arithmetic, with the impact on some participants equivalent to losing several years of education. Other studies have shown that high air pollution is linked to premature birth, low birth weight, mental illness in children and dementia in the elderly.We’re only just beginning to understand how the air we breathe affects not just our physical environment, but our mental capacity as well. And the air we breathe is changing in the long term, as well as the short. Rising carbon dioxide levels – the main driver of climate change – aren’t just a hazard to the earth and other living creatures, they’re also affecting our thinking. At higher levels, CO2 clouds the mind: it makes us slower and less likely to develop new ideas, it degrades our ability to take in new information, change our minds, or formulate complex thoughts.This isn’t merely a problem for the future – as if that would make it better. As we come to understand more about the effects of CO2, we have been measuring more of it, and finding that as it increases outside, it increases inside, too. Outdoor CO2 already reaches 500ppm regularly in industrial cities indoors, in poorly ventilated homes or school workplaces, it can regularly exceed 1,000ppm. A study of bedrooms in Denmark found that overnight concentrations of CO2 exceeded 2,000ppm, with measurable effects on student’s performance the following day.Schools in California and Texas, when measured in 2012, regularly exceeded 2,000ppm in the daytime. And the kind of “green” insulation used to improve the heat retention of buildings – a climate change mitigation process – also raises the levels of CO2 trapped inside.Rather than taking action to mitigate this process, we find case and case again of companies actively trying to increase emissions. Volkswagen notoriously spent years creating complex, embedded software to bypass emissions tests, with the result that cars certified for use in the US actually emitted nitrogen oxide at 40 times the legal limit. In Europe, where the same “defeat devices” were found, and where thousands more of the vehicles were sold, it’s been estimated that 1,200 people will die a decade earlier due to VW’s emissions – and many more, as we now know, will have cognitive difficulties.It’s hard not to see an allegory between Volkswagen’s manipulation of opaque technologies and the ways in which we are being manipulated more broadly by the largely unaccountable systems we engage with every day. Multiple studies have shown that the way in which social media regulates our information intake for profit leaves us more ided, less politically aware, and increasingly prejudiced and violent. YouTube recently suggested I should follow an archive clip of US anchorman Walter Cronkite warning about climate change all the way back in 1980, and a 30-minute conspiracy lecture titled How the Global Warming Scare Began. Mental pollution comes in many forms.The US Environmental Protection Agency announced recently that it was reconsidering Obama-era rules governing the emission of mercury from coal-fired power plants. Symptoms of mercury poisoning include emotional instability, insomnia, reduced cognitive function and memory loss. It was the use of mercury to stiffen hat brims that caused an epidemic of dementia among milliners in the 18th and 19th centuries, the origin of the phrase “mad as a hatter”. It’s hard to think of a measure better tuned to cancelling the future than raising the amount of mercury in the environment, or an act more in keeping with our times than intentionally increasing the recklessness, forgetfulness and stupidity of the population.But then those in charge of our affairs currently have their own chemical load to shed. Since the 1980s, one common pollutant we have managed to curtail is lead, mostly by excluding it from paint, plumbing and petrol. As a result there has been a 4.5-point rise in IQ points in those born after 1985. Those who grew up in Europe and North America between 1965 and 1985 – the cohort who are running things right now – were regularly found to be carrying 20 micrograms per decilitre levels of lead in their bloodstream, which can lead to far greater levels of long-term cognitive impairment than those reported in studies of contemporary air pollution. If you want one simple explanation for the wildly differing political attitudes between current generations, and some of the irrational paths we seem hellbent on taking at present, you could do worse than take lead poisoning into account. Brain damage, it seems, is the one thing the baby boomers are willing to pass on to their kids.• James Bridle is the author of New Dark Age: Technology and the End of the Future"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e5010b91dc2e5fefed32ddc160a3d07227dd4a7/176_201_3009_1806/master/3009.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=902ad17bff9825bec3f0595889d6e065","title":"can labour forge socialism 21st century conference liverpool","story":"The scepticism about Corbynism isn’t because it is too radical, but because in an era of disruption, it is not radical enoughIn among all the noise about Brexit and Donald Trump, there’s a remarkable sound: a great deal of the free-market, laissez-faire ideas that have dominated the last four decades being criticised and contested, perhaps as never before. In the US, the fallout from the election of 2016 has fed into the first stirrings of a new, confidently radical Democratic politics in Britain, the Labour party might still be locked into endless travails and internal tensions, but it has definitely pulled politics leftwards. On a bad day, the political darkness can still feel overwhelming, but even in the most unlikely places, there are sometimes tantalising signs of light. A panicked Tory prime minister is now rhapsodising about public housing. The Economist last week published an essay about the revival of liberalism built around such ideas as land taxation and a guaranteed income. For sure, continuing austerity and the polarised state of politics may bring to mind the hoary old quote from the Italian communist Antonio Gramsci: “The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.” History doesn’t glide it wildly lurches. But the idea that neoliberalism is on the back foot is surely beyond doubt.What kind of capitalism we have, then, is now open to debate. But what cannot be argued with is the technology that sits under it, and the extent to which it defines how we live. Some people might think 2018’s disruptions hold out the prospect of our economy and society somehow being rewound to the era before Margaret Thatcher – but in a world of working lives that endlessly change, information on tap and a public more assertive than ever, there is no going back. To use a term that evokes a lost time of deference, mass production, standardised everything and change handed down from the top, the post-1945 era was Fordist. This one is anything but.As Labour meets this week in Liverpool, the need for left politics to finally adapt to these new conditions will intrude on the debates. At The World Transformed, the Momentum-led alternative conference that has enlivened proceedings since 2016, the blurb for one session baldly reminds its readers that “1970s state socialism is dead”, and there are fascinatingly energised sessions about reinventing politics from the ground up. By way of a nod to the same idea, the party has served notice that one of the big official themes will be the need to “empower communities”. On the eve of a policy splurge that confirmed him as a source of increasingly creative thinking, a profile of John McDonnell in the New Statesman included an observation from one of the shadow chancellor’s close associates: “He came out of a statist tradition, which he has come to see as elitist. He’s now interested in co-operatives, mutuals, in creating the conditions for people to run their own lives.”The problem is that these ideas have yet to be turned into the kind of stories and messages that might decisively push Labour somewhere new. The party has been transformed, but it has a split personality – to quote the academic Jeremy Gilbert, Labour continues to be ided between a “decentralised political movement that would like to build a more democratic and cooperative economy” and “a top-down project focused entirely on maintaining Corbyn’s leadership, which is largely proposing a return to the statist social democracy of the postwar era”. The former demands deep thought, and the willingness to surrender old orthodoxies the latter is a comfort blanket to which much of the party still instinctively clings.There will be a lot of talk in Liverpool about nationalising things, and much applause in response. The party’s opponents will have no trouble claiming that its proposed cure for the grimness of the modern job market is a return to the labour relations of the 1970s its response to the underfunding and privatisation of the NHS will look like a planned return to some imagined golden age in which people pulled levers in Whitehall and goodwill made everything OK.Left politics has always had a susceptibility to conservatism: this is its modern manifestation, made worse by a delusion that (whatever Labour’s current contortions over a second EU referendum) still seems to grip some very important people at the top – the idea that Brexit will somehow create the conditions for an autarkic, parochial, sepia-tinted utopia we should think of as “socialism in one country”.To make those criticisms is not to dream of the 1990s and yearn after a lost era of “centrism”. At the start of a new political season, it feels like an opportune moment to make a point too often overlooked: that some people are sceptical and stand-offish about Corbynism not because of its supposed radicalism, but because it is not nearly radical enough.So far, the new Labour party has had depressingly little to say about the decayed British state and the dysfunctional nature of its power. There is still no meaningful discussion of the stupid voting system that renders millions of us powerless, and thereby played its part in the Brexit vote. Most Labour people seem lamentably uninterested in a system of local and city government that is completely broken, or tensions within the UK that plainly point towards the necessity of a new federal settlement. The fact that huge chunks of the work done ineptly in Whitehall could be pushed down to the regional and local level is barely recognised.In that sense, the imperative should not be nationalisation, but the need to localise and democratise. Labour could free the health service from targets and central diktats, and break it up into democratically accountable units. It could embrace the idea of getting rid of such useless central ministries as the Departments for Work and Pensions, Housing, and Communities and Local Government, and passing their powers to the most local level possible. Perhaps most urgently, Labour policy cries out to be pushed beyond a lost world of secure jobs for all, and into the fabric of how people actually live – as consumers, home-makers, carers, parents. If that sounds abstract, consider two unanswered questions: what does Labour really want to do with England’s outmoded schools system, and our centralised, authoritarian and hateful benefits regime?Every week at the moment, I seem to find myself standing outside an Amazon fulfilment centre: those leviathans that seem to embody their age as much as pits and steelworks symbolised our industrial past. The way they crash-land in communities and extract labour and resources with precious little payback speaks to people’s sense of local powerlessness the fact that they are owned and run by a company whose power crosses borders underlines that Jeff Bezos will only be brought to heel when people and governments from an array of countries jointly agree to act the sense that the jobs they offer will soon be automated away is obvious.So increasingly, I wonder: What is the socialism of the Amazon age? How will it be expressed? And can it be shaped into something that might credibly take power? Put another way, while proudly hanging on to immovable ideas of equality and solidarity, are Labour and the left finally ready to leave the 20th century?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/207575aa16f820ec4dfb0780086ea07eac6a349f/0_372_5584_3351/master/5584.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4af5bb348d8813e22a0a854c3dc9b4da","title":"christine blasey ford brave woman brett kavanaugh","story":"Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations will remind many women of men from their past. However, there can be strength in not forgettingIt’s hard to describe how it feels to be a woman living through the #MeToo era. Not at the centre of anything, but reflecting on your personal experiences. In the beginning I remember just a dark rage, followed by a giddiness that something really did seem to be changing. Then a forced rationality, an awareness that things must not swing too far just because emotions were high and, by God, men had it coming.But lately, it’s just been surprising. For me and many of the women around me, the Brett Kavanaugh case in the US has triggered some unexpectedly profound emotions. There is something of the horror movie about the story of how Donald Trump’s supreme court nominee stands accused of a sexual assault that was allegedly committed more than 30 years ago. It reminds many of us how there are men waiting to resurface from the depths of our memories perhaps it is the guy who “playfully” sexually bullied you in secondary school now showing up on social media, all cheerful, happily established with a picture-perfect family and a completely different recollection of your interaction.He will ask genuinely why the two of you never stayed in touch. Or maybe someone who ruined your reputation in university by making up stories (with just enough truth in them to rob you of complete deniability) popping up in the public eye, perhaps not as a nominee to the highest court in the land, but a lauded expert, an actor, a journalist or political activist, and suddenly you’re 17 and burning with shame again. Despite all your steel and resolution, all the vulnerabilities that were there when that early sexual undermining occurred are still in there, frozen in time, stacked inside you like babushka dolls.When Kavanaugh was first accused of attempting to force himself on Christine Blasey Ford when they were in high school, the detail that stayed with me was that Ford first mentioned him to her therapist years ago, in the context of her fear that he would one day be nominated to the supreme court. And her worst dream came true: he got the nomination, all cheerful and happy and established, the “carpool dad”, the “true intellectual”, the man of “impeccable credentials”. There is something doubly traumatic when these incidents happen at a young age. It’s not only the event and the bewildering inability to deal with it at the time, but the skewed structure of the world that means the odds of the teenage boy becoming a powerful man are much higher than those of you becoming a powerful woman.Women such as Ford have to carry their wounded teenage selves inside them and watch the man who allegedly inflicted these wounds breeze through life becoming more important, connected and influential, unburdened by his past actions.Scholars call it “the accumulation of disadvantage” the process by which the gender playing field is unlevelled over time as small biases compound to create a professional world weighted in favour of men. When you add to that all the ways that women can be degraded sexually by men from a young age, there is an accumulated diminishment and corrosion of confidence.To walk into an imbalanced world like that with your ostensibly “minor” incident, your drunken run-in with a teenage boy in a bedroom at a party, and ask for redress is basically suicide by patriarchy.To walk into a world like that where the accused man has the US president on his side and take a swing, you had better not miss. But that is what is all the more moving about Ford’s decision to come forward. It is very likely that she will miss the target, and very likely knows that. But what I suspect she has done for many women is trigger an excavation of all the things that they had buried and tried to minimise because they wanted to forget and rebuild, because they were young, and because it was such a long time ago, and because really, how can you bring your old irrecoverable teenage pain and demand that it be salved now, after all these years?That excavation to me, at least, is beginning to reveal how the strength is sometimes not in forgetting, but in remembering, and reclaiming. In unfreezing that young frightened girl who you could not help for all these years and animating her in the body of an older, more certain woman. All signs so far still point towards Kavanaugh’s confirmation, but the reckoning and resolution is not in securing vindication, but in demanding it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d083f34b5e76de4ade9e453a186c4e9087d5167d/0_1061_3999_2399/master/3999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25621aff9755ce93376fec2a5cf0845d","title":"male cultural elite blind me too nyrb ian buruma","story":"Harper’s and New York Review of Books both published problematic essays by men disgraced by #MeToo. Here is what that revealsFirst, it was Harper’s. In their October issue, the magazine published an essay by John Hockenberry, the disgraced former public radio host who was accused of sexual harassment and racially inappropriate comments by women he worked with. He sent them emails asking for dates, made comments on their appearance and made sex jokes. In August 2017, after multiple complaints about his behavior were made to WNYC management, Hockenberry quietly retired from his program, The Takeaway. His behavior was only made public later, in reporting by Suki Kim for The Cut.Hockenberry’s Harper’s piece, titled Exile, reached nearly 7,000 words – extraordinarily long for a personal essay – and details the suffering that Hockenberry claims to have endured since his behavior was made public. In the essay, Hockenberry relies heavily on the notion that his disability is exculpatory of his behavior – Hockenberry uses a wheelchair – and compares himself to Lolita, the teen girl who is kidnapped and raped in the Vladimir Nabokov novel.He claims that he has reached out to his accusers and has been ignored or rebuffed, an assertion denied by the women, who say that they have not heard from him. Later, Hockenberry likens the Me Too movement to the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution, and characterizes his harassment of colleagues as “courtship.” “Do I dare make a spirited defense of something once called romance from the darkness of this exile, at the nadir of my personal credibility?” He does dare.Then, there was the New York Review of Books. In an issue titled The Fall of Men, centered on what editor Ian Buruma called “Me Too offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media,” the magazine ran a similar piece, entitled Reflections from a Hashtag, by the Canadian former broadcast star Jian Ghomeshi.The piece, like Hockenberry’s, was a first-person account from a man accused of sexual misconduct – in Ghomeshi’s case, sexual assault – that detailed the suffering he said he had endured as a result of his behavior being made public. Like Hockenberry, Ghomeshi seems not to have much considered the impact that his actions had on the women he targeted, and like Hockenberry, he downplayed the allegations against him and distorted the facts in a self-serving and myopic piece that is short of self-reflection and long on solicitations for pity.Ghomeshi, who was ousted from his job at CBC in 2014, characterizes the accusations against him as stories that “circulated online” that he had been “abusive to an ex girlfriend during sex.” In fact more than 20 women accused Ghomeshi of sexual abuse in incidents that ranged from sexual harassment in the office – in one incident he allegedly told a female colleague he wanted to “hate fuck” her, to “wake” her up – to punching them in the face and choking at least one woman who resisted him. What he characterized as online allegations was in fact an investigative exposé from the Toronto Star. (Several of the claims against Ghomeshi were brought to Canadian court, where he was acquitted on all but one – that charge was dropped on the condition that Ghomeshi issue an apology.) No further reference is made to his victims, but Ghomeshi does recount two anecdotes in which he claims to have charmed women: one who sang with him at a karaoke bar, and another who he chatted up on a train. He proudly tells his readers that he refrained from pursuing sex with her.The reaction online to the pieces was swift, with readers pointing out the factual errors and self-indulgent excesses of the pieces. But even more concerning than the pieces themselves was the statements that these magazines seemed to make in publishing them. In lending their credibility and prestige to essays that disregarded both factual realities and the lived experiences of victimized women, both Harper’s and The New York Review of Books seemed to suggest that they as institutions were invested in maintaining a system that rendered women disposable and granted impunity to men, and willing to disregard editorial standards to do so.This sort of editorial gesture was expected of Harper’s, which aroused controversy in January when they ran a piece by the writer Katie Roiphe that alleged that the Me Too movement was “bad for women.” Roiphe began her career with her 1993 book The Morning After, which argued that many of the incidents that were then beginning to be called date rapes were in fact instances of consensual sex that women simply regretted later on. She has since periodically emerged to issue similar takes on women’s rights. That piece sparked controversy, largely because of reports before publication that it would reveal my identity as the then-anonymous creator of a crowd-sourced document called “Shitty Media Men,” compiling allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and rape by men in magazines and publishing. The revelation had the potential to endanger my safety. I wound up preempting the piece by revealing my own identity in an essay for The Cut.The backlash over the Roiphe article eventually led to the exit of editor James Marcus, who said in an interview with The New York Times in April that he was fired for taking “a principled stand” against the publication of Roiphe piece. Marcus claimed that the magazine’s president and publisher, the billionaire insurance heir Rick MacArthur, had demanded a “contrarian piece on the Me Too movement,” and then dismissed the editor for disliking the one that ran. Former managing editor Hasan Altaf gave a similar account of Harper’s publication of the Hockenberry piece to the Huffington Post, after recently leaving the magazine for The Paris Review. “The way it felt to me, personally, was that our opinions were not taken seriously or considered important,” Altaf said of what he claimed was a near-universal staff opposition to the Hockenberry piece. “The entire editorial staff shared a feeling, and it was dismissed.”The incidents have damaged Harper’s credibility advertisers pulled their ads, writers withdrew their pieces, and subscriptions were cancelled. Mr. Marcus’ departure marks three of the last four Harper’s editors who have been fired after editorial disagreements with Mr MacArthur: Rodger Hodge in 2010, Christopher Cox in 2015, and Mr. Marcus in 2018. (In an email, Harper’s interim editor, Ellen Rosenbush, who edited the Hockenberry piece, said that Mr MacArthur, “does weigh in from time to time on editorial matters,” but claimed that she held “absolute editorial authority.”)As the drama unfolded, with former employees and Harper’s publicist, Giulia Melucci, trading jabs in the press, an unflattering portrait of the magazine emerged. The growing impression was that Harper’s had devolved from a once serious and independent publication to a disorganized and tumultuous organization whose editorial output was functionally little more than an organ for the opinions of its publisher.The New York Review of Books was supposed to be different. The revered magazine, founded by coeditors Robert Silvers and Barbara Epstein in 1963, the Review quickly became primary organ of midcentury American intellectualism, making the uncommon choice to devote column inches to reviews of books from academic presses and publishing luminaries like Hannah Arendt, Irving Howe, Mary McCarthy, Joan Didion, and Susan Sontag, to name only a few, alongside founding writer Elizabeth Hardwick. It has long been considered a relic of the old school New York literati, endowed not only with prestige but with a dignity that was largely lived up to by the writing it published. After the death of charismatic longtime editor Robert Silvers in 2017 (Epstein had already passed, in 2006) the continued existence of the review was in doubt. But the appointment of Ian Buruma, a Dutch writer and critic who had focused much of his work on East Asia, to Silvers’ editorship was meant to reassure readers and staff alike that the Review would go on.The NYRB had maintained its considerable prestige, but the decision to run Ghomeshi’s piece seems to have caused tumult and animosity within the organization that mirrors that which has allegedly roiled Harper’s. Employees of the Review say that they, like the editorial staff at Harper’s, opposed the publication of the piece, and that they, like the staff of Harper’s, were overruled by the powerful man leading the magazine. It was Review employees who leaked the existence of the Ghomeshi piece before it was published, stoking controversy online and leading to speculation about Buruma’s intentions in publishing it. “Some of us were afraid that is would pass without the furor it deserved,” one NYRB employee said in an email of the piece’s publication. “Being unable to speak out publicly ourselves, it was extremely heartening” to read criticism of the piece, and of the decision to publish it, online.Taken alone, either of these incidents might be signals of mere institutional problems of the difficulty of asserting the importance of employee wishes to management, or of the problems that arise in situations where one person – particularly when that one person is white and male – has organizational power that exceeds his sensitivity. For MacArthur, the choice to publish Hockenberry might be taken as a consequence of the impunity of the very wealthy in Buruma’s, it might be seen as the sort of misstep that can befall any new member of an old and venerated institution. The dissatisfaction of these men’s employees, at least, suggests that there are still people of insight, integrity, and moral awareness working at these magazines, and that there is still good work to be done there.But MacArthur and Buruma further degraded the credibility of their magazines shortly after publishing the Hockenberry and Ghomeshi pieces, when they each conducted contentious interviews in which they doubled down on their decisions to publish the pieces and issued new bromides against the Me Too movement.In an eight-minute radio segment with the CBC’s Anna Maria Temonti, MacArthur criticizes his interviewer’s “tone,” compares Me Too to “Soviet style re-education” programs, and suggests that Hockenberry could not be guilty of sexual misconduct because he was in a wheelchair. When Tremonti points out that Hockenberry is accused of harassing and inappropriate comments – things that you don’t need to be standing to do – MacArthur rails against what he calls the women’s “inability” to distinguish between harassment and assault. The implication here is that while MacArthur might concede that rape and assault are wrong, he feels that discussing harassment is a bridge too far – Tremonti has to remind him that sexual harassment is a fireable offense. “You sound flippant,” Tremonti tells him. In complaining about harassment as well as rape and assault, MacArthur implies, women have set the standard for their own treatment too high.In a similarly revealing interview with Issac Chotiner of Slate, Buruma says that Me Too has had “undesirable consequences,” among which he counts Ghomeshi’s denunciation. He condescendingly asserts that he published Ghomeshi’s piece “to help people think this sort of thing through.” Buruma resigned days after the disastrous interview was published, and though he asserted in a subsequent statement that he was not fired, the dismissive arrogance of his answers had made his editorship of the Review seem endangered. When Chotiner presses him about the allegations against Ghomeshi, he says, “The exact nature of his behavior – how much consent was involved – I have no idea, nor is it really my concern.”It should be his concern. As the leaders of prestigious magazines, who hold influence disproportionate to their actual readerships, MacArthur and Buruma have a responsibility to engage meaningfully and honestly with the public conversations that their publications shape and confront.For everything else that Me Too has been – an eruption in several high-profile industries, a reckoning of long-ignored wrongdoing, an overdue confrontation with the ways that men harm women – it has also been an intellectual exercise. Women are introducing new information – saying that they have been hurt, and that they would like for others to be spared this hurt. Those who listen to them – women, and crucially, men – are being asked to imagine their anger, their fear, their frustration, and their pain, and to adjust their understanding of the world accordingly.The project that Me Too has advanced is a visionary assertion that injustices can be righted, that men and women can interact with more integrity and more compassion than we have so far. MacArthur and Buruma have refused this project, denying that the world might be otherwise than they have always known it, asserting that their perceptions are the only correct ones. Those who are too defensive, too incurious, or too bigoted to engage honestly with Me Too are missing out on one of the greatest intellectual feats of our time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77a7d19859c981cc7b219c116abbf9a3cc003c81/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=3000\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac270309a374e8b6e3834d9126e18c63 6000w","title":"americas era of climate mass migration is here","story":"By the end of this century, sea level rises alone could displace 13m people. Many states will have to grapple with hordes of residents seeking dry ground. But, as one expert says, ‘No state is unaffected by this’After her house flooded for the third year in a row, Elizabeth Boineau was ready to flee. She packed her possessions into dozens of boxes, tried not to think of the mold and mildew-covered furniture and retreated to a second-floor condo that should be beyond the reach of pounding rains and swelling seas.Boineau is leaving behind a handsome, early 20th-century house in Charleston, South Carolina, the shutters painted in the city’s eponymous shade of deep green. Last year, after Hurricane Irma introduced 8in of water into a home Boineau was still patching up from the last flood, local authorities agreed this historic slice of Charleston could be torn down.“I was sloshing through the water with my puppy dog, debris was everywhere,” she said. “I feel completely sunken. It would cost me around $500,000 to raise the house, demolish the first floor. I’m going to rent a place instead, on higher ground.”Millions of Americans will confront similarly hard choices as climate change conjures up brutal storms, flooding rains, receding coastlines and punishing heat. Many are already opting to shift to less perilous areas of the same city, or to havens in other states. Whole towns from Alaska to Louisiana are looking to relocate, in their entirety, to safer ground.The era of climate migration is, virtually unheralded, already upon America.The population shift gathering pace is so sprawling that it may rival anything in US history. “Including all climate impacts it isn’t too far-fetched to imagine something twice as large as the Dustbowl,” said Jesse Keenan, a climate adaptation expert at Harvard University, referencing the 1930s upheaval in which 2.5 million people moved from the dusty, drought-ridden plains to California.This enormous migration will probably take place over a longer period than the Dustbowl but its implications are both profound and opaque. It will plunge the US into an utterly alien reality. “It is very difficult to model human behaviour under such extreme and historically unprecedented circumstances,” Keenan admits.The closest analogue could be the Great Migration – a period ning a large chunk of the 20th century when about 6 million black people departed the Jim Crow south for cities in the north, midwest and west.“There’s not a state unaffected by this,” said demographer Mat Hauer, lead author of the research, which is predicated on a severe 6ft sea level increase. There are established migration preferences for some places – south Florida to Georgia, New York to Colorado – but in many cases people would uproot to the closest inland city, if they have the means.“The Great Migration was out of the south into the industrialized north, whereas this is from every coastal place in the US to every other place in the US,” said Hauer. “Not everyone can afford to move, so we could end up with trapped populations that would be in a downward spiral. I have a hard time imagining what that future would be like.”Within just a few decades, hundreds of thousands of homes on US coasts will be chronically flooded. By the end of the century, 6ft of sea level rise would redraw the coastline with familiar parts – such as southern Florida, chunks of North Carolina and Virginia, much of Boston, all but a sliver of New Orleans – missing. Warming temperatures will fuel monstrous hurricanes – like the devastating triumvirate of Irma, Maria and Harvey in 2017, followed by Florence this year – that will scatter survivors in jarring, uncertain ways.The projections are starting to materialize in parts of the US, forming the contours of the climate migration to come.“I don’t see the slightest evidence that anyone is seriously thinking about what to do with the future climate refugee stream,” said Orrin Pilkey, professor emeritus of coastal geology at Duke University. “It boggles the mind to see crowds of climate refugees arriving in town and looking for work and food.”Pilkey’s new book – Sea Level Rise Along Americas Shores: The Slow Tsunami – envisions apocalyptic scenes where millions of people, largely from south Florida, will become “a stream of refugees moving to higher ground”.“They will not be the bedraggled families carrying their few possessions on their backs as we have seen in countless photos of people fleeing wars and ethnic cleansing, most recently in Myanmar and Syria,” Pilkey states in his book. “Instead, they will be well-off Americans driving to a new life in their cars, with moving trucks behind, carrying a lifetime of memories and possessions.”Dejected with frigid New York winters, Chase Twichell and her husband purchased a four-bedroom apartment in Miami Beach in 2011, with the plan of spending at least a decade basking in the sunshine. At first, keeping a pair of flip-flops on hand to deal with the flooded streets seemed an acceptable quirk, until the magnitude of the encroaching seas became apparent when the city spent $400m to elevate streets near Twichell’s abode.Twichell began to notice water pumps were spewing plastic bags, condoms and chip packets into the bay. Friends’ balconies started getting submerged. Twichell, a poet, found apocalyptic themes creeping into her work. Last year, she sold the apartment to a French businessman and moved back to upstate New York.“It was like end of the world stuff,” she said. “It was crazy for us to have such a big investment in such a dangerous situation.” Her neighbours initially scolded her but now several are also selling up, fretting that the real estate and insurance markets for properties like theirs will seize up.“It was horrible but fascinating to see it,” Twichell said. “It’s like we got to see the future and it wasn’t pretty. It’s like a movie where there’s a terrible volcano that is destroying everything, only it’s much slower than that.”A sense of fatalism is also starting to grip some local officials. Philip Stoddard, mayor of South Miami, has seen a colleague, spooked by sea level rise, move to California and some neighbours sell their houses before an expected slump in prices. Stoddard and his wife regularly discuss buying a fallback property, perhaps in Washington DC.“Most people will wait for the problem to be bad to take action, that’s what I worry about,” he said. “We can buy a lot of time, but in the end we lose. The sea level will go over the tops of our buildings.”Sanitation is an immediate preoccupation for Stoddard, given the large proportion of residents who aren’t served by sewage works. “If you’re using a septic tank and your toilet starts to overflow into your bathroom because of water inundation, that’s a basis-of-civilization problem,” he said. “A medieval city wasn’t a nice smelling place and they had a lot of diseases.”Those living near the coasts will face pressures of the gradual (sea level rise) as well as dramatic (storms) nature but people inland will also be harried to move by climate change.Farming techniques and technology have improved immeasurably since the Dustbowl but rising temperatures are still expected to diminish yields for crops such as maize, soybeans and wheat, prompting the departure of younger people from farming. By 2050, Texas county, the largest wheat-producing county in Oklahoma, could spend an extra 40 days a year above 90F (32C) compared with now.Meanwhile, cities already struggling with heat will see wealthy residents head for cooler climes. Last year, 155 people died in Phoenix due to a particularly fierce summer. Increasing heat will start testing the durability of the populace, even those shielded by air conditioning. In the western states, wildfires are getting larger, razing homes in ever more spectacular ways and choking thousands of people with carcinogenic smoke.Further to the south, at the border, there are suggestions that people from Central America are being nudged towards the US because of drought and hurricanes in their homelands, part of a trend that will see as many as 300 million climate refugees worldwide by 2050.“People will get very grumpy and upset with very hot temperatures,” said Amir Jina, an environmental economist at the University of Chicago who co-authored the research on economic losses. “Even if you have air conditioning, some areas start to look less habitable. By the middle of the century parts of the south-west and south-east won’t look attractive to live in.“That insidious climate migration is the one we should worry about. The big disasters such as hurricanes will be obvious. It’s the pressures we don’t know or understand that will reshape population in the 21st century.”Prodded to name refuges in the US, researchers will point to Washington and Oregon in the Pacific north-west, where temperatures will remain bearable and disasters unlikely to strike. Areas close to the Great Lakes and in New England are also expected to prove increasingly attractive to those looking to move.But these population shifts are uncertain and are bound by a tangle of other factors and caveats. People will still largely follow paths guided by nearby family or suitable jobs. Even those who do want to move may find favoured locations too expensive.Some will just grimly hang on. “With property rights as strong as they are in the US, some people may choose to go down with the ship,” said Harvard’s Keenan. “The question is whether they have the means and the options to do anything else.”“People can usually cope with being a little less comfortable, but if you see repeated storms or severe damage to crops, that will trigger change,” said Solomon Hsiang, who researches how climate change will affect society at the University of California.“There will be pressure to move a little north. It won’t be everyone, though, it won’t be like the great migration of wildebeest in Africa. Whole cities picking up and moving would be hugely expensive.”Smaller towns are giving relocation a go, however. In 2016, the community of Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana was the first place to be given federal money to replant itself. The population, situated on an island being eaten away by the sea, is looking to move to a former sugar cane farm 30 miles inland.“We are called climate refugees but I hate that term,” said Chantal Comardelle, who grew up in the Isle de Jean Charles community.“We will be the first ones to face this in the modern US but we won’t be the last. It’s important for us to get it right so other communities know that they can do it, too.”About a dozen coastal towns in Alaska are also looking to relocate, as diminishing sea ice exposes them to storms and rising temperatures thaw the very ground beneath them. One, Newtok, has identified a new site and has some federal funding to begin uprooting itself.A buyout of damaged and at-risk homes has already occurred in New York City’s Staten Island in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, while certain flood-prone houses in Houston, pummeled by Hurricane Harvey last year, are also being purchased and razed.But the cost of doing this for all at-risk Americans would be eye-watering. Estimates range from $200,000 to $1m per person to undertake a relocation. If 13 million people do have to move, it seems fantastical to imagine $13tn, or even a significant fraction of this amount, being spent by governments to ease the way.“As a country we aren’t set up to deal with slow-moving disasters like this, so people around the country are on their own,” said Joel Clement, a former Department of the Interior official who worked on the relocation of Alaskan towns.“In the Arctic I’m concerned we’ve left it too late. Younger people have left because they know the places are doomed. These towns won’t be relocated within five years and I’m sure there will be a catastrophic storm up there. My hope is no lives will be lost.”Ultimately, the US will have to choose what it wants to defend and hope its ingenuity outstrips the environmental changes ranged against it. Not everyone will be able to shelter behind fortifications like the ‘big U’ planned to defend lower Manhattan. Wrenching decisions will have to be made as to what and where will be sacrificed.“We won’t see whole areas abandoned but neighborhoods will get sparse and wild looking, the tax base will start to crumble,” said Stoddard, mayor of South Miami. “We don’t have the laws to deal with that sort of piecemeal retreat. It’s magical thinking to think someone else will buy out your property.“We need a plan as to what will be defended because at the moment the approach is that some kid in a garage will come with a solution. There isn’t going to be a mop and bucket big enough for this problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c60f6cd03c5c089861f9e11f2f0710cfda80bba0/171_115_2285_1371/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3725b8b0137d07e5da3978e913c91a9b","title":"ebb and flow britains tidal coastline in pictures","story":"Photographers David Levene and Christopher Thomond picked spots around Britain’s coastline at high and low tideby  David Levene and  Christopher Thomond Words by  Patrick BarkhamThe tide is a long wave. The vertical movement of water pulled by a constellation of air pressure, wind, topography, the sun and the elliptical orbit of the moon is rarely visible to the naked eye. Instead we see the impact of this irrepressible force on our coastline roughly every six hours, when the tide is high and when it is low.The British coast has some of the mightiest tides in the world – the Bristol Channel has the second biggest rise and fall after Nova Scotia – and two  photographers, David Levene and Christopher Thomond, spent much of the summer exploring how the tide’s ebb and flow reveals different worlds.Arnside in Lancashire. Photographs: Christopher ThomondThomond relied on his naked eye to line up each high- and low-tide image. “I found them quite a struggle – technically it was difficult to line the two pictures up in your head,” he admits. “I’d find a vantage point at low tide and come back eight hours later and the markers I had in my head to line up the image had disappeared.”Thomond says people probably imagine taking pictures of tides at beautiful coastline spots to be a rather lovely holiday job, but the reality was he had to squeeze in the work between more mundane tasks. The “pure practicalities” – particularly getting two pictures in good light – overtook any pleasure in admiring the liminal world revealed and then covered by the tide, he says. “I didn’t choose a view, set up the tripod, wait for six hours and take another picture. I shot five or six scenes from the same area and tried to get some variety and replicate each one. You could never quite predict how somewhere was going to look at high tide.”Fossil hunting at Lyme Regis, Dorset. Photographs: David LeveneLevene tried to begin with a compelling low-tide picture. The biggest challenge was obtaining the high-tide picture of Lyme Regis on one of the hottest days of the year. He took the low-tide image of fossil hunters from the top of a fragment of eroding cliff that was only accessible at low tide. “I then had to wake at the crack of dawn, come down with a coffee and suncream and walk out at low tide and wait for the high tide, so I was sat out there in the heatwave for about eight hours.”The Wash from Snettisham, Norfolk. Photographs: David LeveneLevene was often too busy trying different photographic positions or checking tidal apps to experience the meditative beauty of the ebb and flow of the tide. But he was moved by the unexpected drama of the North Sea flooding over great expanse of the Wash at Snettisham.“The way that the water came in through the mudflats was just amazing,” he says. “It takes forever to come in but for the last 40 minutes the channels suddenly fill up. I was taking pictures all the while.”Taking the photographs from exactly the same position was sometimes unexpectedly difficult. Levene imagined he might mark the spot for his tripod and return six hours later, but in often busy places or natural beaches it wasn’t possible to leave a durable mark.Instead he used his eye. “You’ve got to fidget yourself into the right position by looking at the original picture you’ve taken and use reference points from it,” he says. To get a really precise match, Levene also plugged his camera into his computer at his tide-watching spot to overlay the original picture with the new image revealed by the camera.Crosby beach in Merseyside.

The CCC said it saw little evidence that the 2032 target would be met.Sturgeon announced last month another £15m towards electric charging points for cars and £20m for a low carbon loans fund. She has said the A9 trunk road from Perth to Scrabster would become the UK’s longest “electric highway” with regular roadside charging points.Even so, sales of ultra-low emission cars have been consistently slower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK. The latest UK government data shows 7,700 ULEV cars were sold in Scotland in the first three months of 2018 compared with 130,000 in England, or about 4,000 less than Scotland’s population share.Tom Ballantine, the chairman of the umbrella group Stop Climate Chaos Scotland, said MSPs at Holyrood should amend the new climate bill going through the Scottish parliament to toughen up policy.“This new independent report is clear that we need decisive and urgent action to keep Scotland’s climate change emissions falling rapidly,” he said. “Science is telling us we need to act faster. We are starting to see the serious effects of wilder weather, with droughts and heatwaves close to home and around the world this year.”A Scottish government spokesman said they welcomed the CCC’s confirmation it was on track to hit its emissions reductions target but he did not respond in detail to the committee’s recommendations.   “The committee’s report shows Scotland continues to lead the UK in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and that we have met our statutory emission reduction target for the third successive year,” he said. “We will continue to look at what more we can do to address climate change and will consider the report’s recommendations carefully.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48012433417fb4af7e8319bc20cb07d49cb9613/8_0_1646_988/master/1646.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa5b367d51b8665bc7d07182651df49b","title":"johnny english v bond whos cinemas best hero for brexit britain","story":"Inept, bumbling and xenophobic, perhaps Rowan Atkinson’s character better represents modern Britain than his more suave equivalent Two highlights of Danny Boyle’s celebrated London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony were undoubtedly the Queen parachuting in with James Bond and the surprise cameo by Rowan Atkinson’s Mr Bean, as “first synthesizer” in the London Symphony Orchestra’s rendition of Chariots of Fire. Little did we realise at the time what a torch-passing moment this was.Six years on, look at where we are. The Bond brand is in crisis. Daniel Craig was only just persuaded to return (with a skipful of cash) but Danny Boyle has walked from directing the latest instalment, and some are wondering whether the franchise shouldn’t just call it a day. Meanwhile, with exquisite timing, along comes a third outing for Atkinson’s own spoof spy in Johnny English Strikes Again. The question is: which one better represents modern Britain?Most Brits would prefer to think of themselves as Bond: dashing, sophisticated, cool in a crisis, seducing all before them and subduing their foes. But to the rest of the world, they are far closer to English: inept, bumbling, xenophobic, and likely to make any situation worse. In Johnny English Strikes Again, Atkinson launches missiles at French cyclists, burns down a French restaurant, and stumbles around blindly assaulting innocent Londoners (in a virtual reality test gone wrong), while Emma Thompson tells him: “The country is in a state of complete chaos.” Even if you are trying your hardest not to read any of this in the context of Brexit (there, I said it), the rest of the world will not be so generous.Between English and his other Anglo caricature, Mr Bean, Atkinson is as big a brand as Bond globally. Mr Bean is so huge in China that Atkinson reprised the character last year for a local movie the rest of the world never saw. The animated series is broadcast in 195 countries. Bean is part of the culture. Via an interactive mobile game, he’s the face of tourist promotions for post-Brexit London and he’s the figure every vaguely weak politician is compared to: Ed Miliband, Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, even Theresa May (“the Mrs Bean of British politics” - the Sun). Atkinson himself waded into political waters last month, defending Boris Johnson’s joke about burqa-wearers resembling letterboxes as “pretty good” (to be fair, he was more interested in free speech than fanning Islamophobia – we hope).According to Atkinson, who’s now 63, Mr Bean has officially retired. Strikes Again will likely be the comic’s last turn as Johnny English, too. But while the press is perennially speculating which actor should be the next Bond, perhaps the more important question is: who should be the next Johnny English? Daniel Craig? Idris Elba? Michael Gove? Let the bidding commence…Johnny English Strikes Again is in cinemas from 5 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ad44d46754c7f7667bb4fb9a5b2d65429146859/0_773_3158_1894/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bff4b568dd38a99d15dea400cb90b1e1","title":"scala london the king of repertory cinema","story":"London’s legendary rep cinema offered audiences space to indulge fantasies and enjoy an unmatched cinematic experience This year marks the 40th anniversary of the start of the Scala cinema’s now-legendary repertory programme as a 22-year old post-punk movie buff, I originated the rep ethos after being taken on in 1978 as programming manager of what was then a purpose-built 350-seat cinema in Charlotte Street in the West End of London. When we moved to Kings Cross in 1981, I became the co-owner, up until its closure in 1993. We specialised in the offbeat and the surreal, the transgressive and just plain freakish – and there has been nothing like it in Britain’s cinema world since.Now we have a book about the Scala, compiled by another former programmer, Jane Giles, celebrating its sordid celluloid heritage. Reflecting on those halcyon years, from 1979-1993, I was prompted to recall David Hockney’s memories of going to the cinema in Bradford as a child. He would sneak in through the exit with his pals and always sat in the front row in fear of the usher’s torchlight. He then became immersed in the film. Years later, when he could afford to buy a ticket and entered from the back, he realised that the screen had hard sides, and that the universe he had become mesmerised by was not infinite. I think most of the Scala clientele were looking to e into that fathomless immersion, releasing them into alternate, often transgressive, universes, where the pictures and images spoke louder than words, but were tinged with a vestige of guilty pleasure.It’s hard to picture the cultural landscape of the London cinema scene in the 60s and 70s for a budding teenage cinephile. At the flick of a switch, almost all of the films we showed are now available to download, but when the Scala began as a repertory cinema in earnest in 1979, such accessibility to this visual treasure trove was unimaginable.Living in London, the benefit of Time Out – not the free handout it has become, but the indispensable cultural barometer it once was – cannot be overstressed. From the moment it was launched in 1968, Time Out became the guide for all Londoners interested in the arts, and many of those film critics went on to be film practitioners. Without the internet and with so little coverage of film in national newspapers, a few well-chosen words in Time Out could mean the difference between an empty or full cinema.But to experience their recommendations was often a journey across the width and breadth of the metropolis. Each cinema had an idiosyncratic identity that also disguised an inverted snobbery. The Electric on Portobello Road showed Siegel, Fuller and Borowczyk movies but never any “trash”. The Everyman in Hampstead showed Douglas Sirk films and cosier seasons of art movies. The Academy on Oxford Street had a steady diet of classic European features, from Buñuel to Renoir. The ICA on the Mall showed third-world movies and, controversially, Andy Warhol films. The London Film-Makers’ Co-op, in the backwaters of Camden, showed avant garde and experimental films. The Starlight Club in the Mayfair Hotel showed exclusively Hollywood classics and musical comedies from the 30s and 40s. The Classic Cinema chain showed all-night Hammer horror films of the X certificate variety on Friday and Saturday nights in Notting Hill, Victoria and the Haymarket. The Rex Cinema in Islington showed double-bills of movies that nobody else wanted to show, and when it became the Screen on the Green in the early 1970s, specialised in American “alternative cinema” from the period.Most of the 35mm prints these cinemas showed were eviscerated by the censors, worn out, tatty and likely to implode and burn in the rickety old projectors that were screening them. At the National Film Theatre in Waterloo, with access to the BFI archive, seasons of films would be presented, often uncut, such as the entire existing Bergman oeuvre. But the inidual films would be shown once or twice only and if you didn’t catch it then, with no recourse to television, VHS, DVD or download, the opportunity to see that obscure Bergman would not happen again for another six or seven years.The insane ambition of the Scala cinema was to try and distil the best of those idiosyncratic cinemas into one gigantic smorgasbord, a celebratory movie digest with the addition of music, performance and a healthy disregard for censorship of any kind. When I look back at the programme I produced in June 1979, for example, I realise that all of the ingredients are there as a blueprint for the future, from Klaus Kinski rubbing shoulders with John Wayne, Judy Garland linking hands with Toshiro Mifune, and Rock Rock Rock! sharing time with The Battle of Chile. In my career as a film producer, I still get inspiration from the Scala’s programming. For instance, in the first all-nighter of June 1979, we showed Kurosawa’s Ikiru (1952). Nearly 40 years on from that Scala screening, I’m reading a screenplay for a version I commissioned that will be set in 1950s London, and which I hope to shoot next year.The films that were shown at the Scala and the cinema itself continue to be an inspiration for the film-makers who passed through the doors. For most audiences, however, it created a private space for them, collectively and inidually, to indulge their fantasies and become part of a cinematic experience that embraced like-minded freaks. Like a chameleon, the Scala was a beacon of camaraderie and companionship for lovers of Laurel and Hardy and Fassbinder alike. While the experience of watching movies was perhaps a personal relationship between the film and the inidual audience member, watching the silly grins on the faces of The Prisoner fan club – Six of One – after the last ever episode was screened, or the B-movie western fans doffing their Stetsons’ after marathon screenings, was joyous. I think in my mind, the real pleasure of being part of the Scala was imagining that people would make the journey across London to see a Clint Eastwood all-nighter, and then perhaps return for a screening of Jean Genet’s Un Chant d’Amour.The demise of the Scala cinema was inevitable in the face of today’s access to so many movies, perfectly preserved and in so many different formats, and its rebirth impossible and arguably unnecessary – other than in the pop-up Scalarama version that now seems to be an annual event. More importantly, those guilty pleasures have become mainstream entertainment. Thirty-five years ago, Three Billboards, Call Me By Your Name and The Shape of Water would have been regarded as cult films – Scala classics. The truth is though, for most people in Britain, movies were just the flicks.It’s just that some, like the Scala audiences and David Hockney, were looking a bit harder than others.• Scala Cinema 1978-1993 (FAB Press) by Jane Giles is published on 18 October.

Learning to check cakes for doneness with a strand of spaghetti, for example, was, and years later still is, a proper a-ha! As are pressing an unpeeled clove of garlic with the heel of my hand so it splits and the skin comes away, rolling a lemon back and forth on the table so it gets juicy, tucking cold butter in a back pocket, or leaving a tapped hard-boiled egg in cold water for 30 seconds so the cracked shell comes away like a cloak. Even though these tricks are now common – banal, even, when there are YouTube videos documenting them, it doesn’t take away from the fact these are daily a-has as satisfying as getting 12 across or remembering who played that character in The Long Good Friday.It’s a similar feeling when you discover that something you have previously done one way can be done in a quicker, easier way. With the rice-stuffed tomatoes I wrote about last year, for example – a summer standard on home tables and bakery counters in Rome – it turns out the rice doesn’t need to be pre-boiled, and instead can simply be mixed with olive oil, the pulp excavated from the tomatoes and some seasoning, then rested, before being spooned into the tomato shells. I have now done this dozens of times, but I still always think a-ha! as the rice cooks and swells (ideally, so much it dislodges the tomato lid). It is the same a-ha! when I make Claudia Roden’s stuffed courgettes from her book of Middle Eastern food, a fitting book to celebrate this week, I think, because it has been transporting me for decades now – and also because it was the Arabs who introduced rice to Sicily, Italy and, ultimately, the rest of Europe.A new revelation last week was discovering that, if you can’t find or don’t have an apple corer, you can hollow out a courgette by trimming the stem end, sticking a skewer to nearly the end, then swirling it – like you do when trying to get a beach umbrella into the sand – until you have a nice hole, into which you can insert a slim serrated knife, which you then use to twist out the pulp.Herbs in cooking are like accents in words: they can change a dish completely. In Rome, the stuffed meat courgettes I buy from Sartor butchers on Testaccio market are sold to be simmered with tomato and the peppery and familiar fragrance of basil. A similar Sicilian recipe suggests tomato with oregano, which conjures up a Sicilian hillside – wild and musty. The mint, mixed with lemon and garlic, is unmistakably Middle Eastern. Like fresh air, somehow. The cooking provides a bit of sauce, so serve both courgettes and sauce warm rather than hot, with bread.And now I remember – it was Helen Mirren in The Long Good Friday.8 medium courgettesSalt and black pepper200g minced beef or lamb75g rice1 tomato, peeled and diced2 tbsp parsley, chopped1 pinch allspiceOlive oil or butter2 tomatoes, sliced1 tbsp tomato puree2 garlic cloves, crushed to a pulp with a little salt1 small bunch mint, choppedJuice of 1 lemonWash the courgettes, then sprinkle with salt and leave for half an hour to soften them.Make the stuffing by mixing the beeflamb, rice, diced tomato, parsley, allspice and a good pinch each of salt and black pepper.Trim the stem end of each courgette, then, using a narrow apple corer or slim serrated knife, scoop out the pulp without breaking the skin. Fill two-thirds of each hollow with stuffing (this leaves space for the rice to expand).Cover the base of a large pan with some olive oil or dot with butter, make a layer of sliced tomato, then lay the courgettes on top.Dissolve the tomato puree in 250ml warm water, then pour this over the courgettes. Cover the pan, bring to a gentle boil, then reduce to a simmer for an hour, until the courgettes are very soft.In the last minutes of cooking, crush the garlic with a little salt, add the mint leaves, then add to the pan along with the lemon juice. Set aside to cool a little before serving warm or at room temperature."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3d0beaee20a9873e3d4305c4a5835972a535582/0_488_7959_4776/master/7959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03a7f0656a8baeedccb2b522a83a04da","title":"thomasina miers spiced lamb and aubergine fatteh recipe","story":"A glorious muddle of lamb, roasted aubergine, Middle Eastern spices and crisp chickpeasLast year I was at Breddo’s, an extremely good taqueria in London’s Soho, and found myself ordering the crab nachos.

Drizzle in two tablespoons of oil, season, toss, spread in an even layer and roast for 25-30 minutes, until golden and dark at the edges.Meanwhile, spread the pitta pieces on a separate tray, drizzle with two tablespoons of oil and pop in the oven with the aubergine for the final eight to 10 minutes of cooking, until the pitta is crisp and turning golden at the edges. Remove and leave to cool – the pieces do not need to be evenly cooked.While the aubergine is in the oven, fry the onion in the remaining two tablespoons of oil in a large pan over a medium heat, until golden. While it’s cooking, warm the cumin, coriander and allspice briefly in a small pan, then grind to a powder. Stir into the onions, along with the garlic, salt, cinnamon and paprika, and cook for a further three to four minutes to soften the raw flavour of the garlic and spices. Turn up the heat and add the lamb mince, seasoning well as it goes in the pan. Cook, breaking up the mince with a spoon, for seven to 10 minutes, until the lamb is cooked through.Add the cooked aubergine to the lamb, stir in the pomegranate molasses, season, and cook gently for a few minutes to allow the flavours to mingle.For the chickpeas, fry the garlic in the oil over a medium heat and, when light golden, remove and discard. Stir in the chickpeas, season and fry for a minute to warm through.Combine the garlic yoghurt ingredients and season to taste.When you’re ready to eat, lay out the crisp pitta on a large plate and spoon over the lamb-aubergine mix, followed by the chickpeas, garlic yoghurt, herbs, nuts, chilli and pomegranate seeds, if using. Serve at once.If you are avoiding wheat, this dish is also delicious with rice of any variety. Use the same mince and spicing to make an eastern pie with a sweet potato top – this is always a very popular supper dish at home.

Well, regular in one sense but not in another given it is Rúben Neves and Diogo Jota who are sitting in front of a plate of delicious Portuguese custard tarts – pastéis de nata – talking about cricket.For Jota and Neves, who joined Wolves in July last year after playing together at Porto, this little corner of the Black Country feels like home away from home. Hélder Costa, another member of the sizeable Portuguese contingent at the club, is credited with discovering the place, which opened 13 months ago. Monica, who is from Porto, could not have timed things better in that respect, although she has no interest in football and was oblivious to the fact a number of her customers were household names and worth millions of pounds until she saw her boyfriend talking to them and asked how he knew them.Neves and Jota, who got to know each other playing for Portugal’s Under-21s, are terrific company. Humble and affable, they speak with such maturity it is easy to forget they are 21 years old. At times they are like a married couple as they finish off one another’s sentences, no more so than when the conversation turns to the slightly awkward question of how they compare Wolverhampton with Porto.“It’s not possible to compare, it’s completely different,” Neves says, diplomatically. “In Porto it’s a tourist city. It’s close to the river, the ocean as well, there’s a lot of history. The wine and the food also. And here it’s an industrial city. But we’re fine with it. We want to play football … in the best league in the world, so the city doesn’t matter,” Jota adds. “And we have a good home and our family with us,” continues Neves.The overriding impression is that Neves and Jota could not be happier. Jota talks about how much more comfortable he is off the field in Wolverhampton than in Porto, where the level of attention was suffocating at times, and both remark on how refreshing it is to be in a league where the ball is in play a lot more. “Time-wasting is one of the worst things we have in Portugal,” Jota says, sighing. “For example, when we played against Manchester City we still wanted to play when we had Jonny injured. But in Portugal, you’ll get a lot of players ‘injured’.”The follow-up question prompts Neves and Jota to react with laughter and a sense of incredulity. Given that their manager is also Portuguese, does he ever get invited to the birthday dinners? “Nooooooooo!” the two respond in unison, looking flabbergasted. “You can’t cross that line,” Jota says, smiling.Their level of respect for Nuno, who also managed them at Porto, shines through when they talk about him. “He’s a really intense and ambitious coach,” Neves says. “I think the most important thing is the motivation – he’s always motivated to do his best all the time. Even when we’re playing good, he wants us to play better. I think this makes the difference with him.”Everything comes a lot more easily with a ball at their feet. Neves has caught the eye this season with his wonderful range of passing, and it feels a matter of time before Jota, Wolves’ top scorer last season, opens his Premier League account. “We want to make ourselves look good in the best league in the world,” Jota says. “When it was our first game, against Everton, I was very emotional, because it really means something for me. When I came on to the field, I thought: ‘I’m here’.”Saturday’s visit to Old Trafford promises to be another special occasion, especially with José Mourinho in the opposite dugout. Neves, who grew up supporting Porto, can vividly remember their 2004 Champions League triumph under Mourinho, even though he was only seven. “I watched the final with my family,” he says. “We went into Porto to celebrate because all my family are fans. Mourinho is a legend at Porto.”Rather surprisingly neither Neves nor Jota has spoken to Mourinho, despite plenty of common ground, including when it comes to their agent. Jorge Mendes represents all three and it is interesting listening to Jota’s response when asked how important Mendes is from a player perspective.“He’s like my right arm,” Jota says. “I think from a player’s point of view, you feel you are with the best at his job. I feel there is no one better than him to manage my career, so I have nothing to worry about – just to do my job on the field. When you speak with him, he’s really ambitious and he says you can always do more. He’s very confident and believes in you more than you do yourself sometimes.”Monica could probably do with Mendes’s help, too, because sadly Aromas de Portugal is on the market. Monica’s father is ill and the family have asked her to return home, meaning she is trying to find a new owner. All the catering equipment is included in the price and the same goes for a distinguished list of regular customers, provided the place remains in Portuguese hands. “We hope it does,” says Neves. “We have alternatives. But the best place for us is here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f756722cb8376ccdb6425824455f340369a17e5/282_47_2058_1235/master/2058.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c5afdbada5f52e173e6fb952a1ebf91","title":"petr cech arsene wenger style arsenal unai emery football","story":"• Veteran says Arsenal working much harder under Unai Emery• ‘This is how it should be. We have very healthy competition’Petr Cech believes that Arsenal have fallen short in recent years because their obsession with playing football in a certain way under Arsène Wenger was more important than victory itself.The 36-year-old goalkeeper has seen a change of mentality under Unai Emery, whom he suggested was more demanding than Wenger, and he felt it was on display in Sunday’s 2-0 home win over Everton.Arsenal were poor in the first half and were it not for Cech, who made a string of excellent saves, they would have been behind. But they shook their heads clear after the interval to tough out the win and Cech took pleasure in the “ugly” success. It was the club’s fourth Premier League win in succession.“What we lacked in the past – I would say the ‘Arsenal way’ was more important than getting the points sometimes and this is not how you win the league,” said Cech, who was a champion on four occasions at his previous club, Chelsea. “Sometimes you need to make sure you win an ugly game, when you are not playing completely well but you just dig deep, close the back door and win 1-0 no matter how.Wenger was synonymous with a purity of style but he came to be accused of giving his players an easy ride. It did not seem unrelated that they would be susceptible to breakdowns in matches. Under Emery, the training has been more intense and varied, and Cech feels that the squad is developing a greater focus.“It comes from the preparation, the everyday work and from the manager’s way of playing the game, as well,” Cech said. “We work very hard every day to give ourselves the chance to compete with everybody and hopefully it will be working even better than it has been for the last four games.“He is very demanding and this is how you improve. I think the place has become much more demanding in every way so this is great to see because this is what initially drives everybody forward and gives you the kind of kick that: ‘I’m not doing enough to start the game’ or ‘I’m not doing enough to keep my spot in the game,’ because the manager asked for precision and hard work every day. This is how it should be. We have very healthy competition and we are actually taking the benefit of it.”Nobody would have spoken about Arsenal’s hardiness after Everton had Cech not saved them and, for long spells, they were predictable going forward. In short, Emery’s team are a work in progress and they plainly have obstacles to overcome.“When a club win titles, it means you have a team with the knowhow to finish it off and you can see it in any sport,” Cech said. “I take Tiger Woods. It’s been some years since he won a Major tournament and the longer it goes on, the harder it becomes.“This club hasn’t won the league for over 10 years so obviously you need to get back to knowing how to do it. We started with the new manager from scratch, basically, and we try to get this mentality of winning every game, progressing every game, working every day and, hopefully, we can build this up and win the title sooner rather than later.“It was a great win against Everton because, having lost our first two games of the season, we needed to bounce back and now we have four wins in a row – two away, two at home – and we are in a much better place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a5db320e10cb17ccdcf65dff1d049405aa31ecf/403_57_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d74ce2036964ca4473bda46d0d32d5","title":"liverpool impress ronaldo ridiculousness and cows cows cows football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Lars Sivertsen and Jonathan Wilson to discuss the Champions League, Ronaldo’s red, the timekeeping skills of cows and Mark Hughes’s elusive smileJoin the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

The best football of the Welshman’s career so far came in the red colours of his country at Euro 2016 rather than those of Arsenal. Unai Emery has also struggled to galvanise the midfielder but, playing behind the front men, Ramsey broke his season’s drought of goals and assists by supplying Alexandre Lacazette the chance to boom in Arsenal’s opener against Everton. He inadvertently doubled his total with a stumble over the ball that gave Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang the chance to score Arsenal’s second from an obviously offside position. It betrayed a continuing lack of confidence in front of goal when a player of Ramsey’s finishing ability – he scored 10 times in the Premier League in 2013-14 – and energy ought to be Arsenal’s equivalent of Frank Lampard. John Brewin• Match report: Arsenal 2-0 Everton• Silva ‘frustrated’ at Arsenal’s ‘offside’ second goalIf Anthony Knockaert had doubled his stoppage-time haul on Saturday, rather than seeing Paulo Gazzaniga cling to his last-gasp shot, thoughts would have turned to the moment a few minutes earlier when – with Tottenham 2-0 up – Harry Kane ran clear only to be thwarted by Mat Ryan. The miss did not prove costly and it is fairer on Kane that he was not rounded upon as a result. He probably still needs a rest but this was a sharper display from the centre-forward. “Of course I could have done better in most games this season,” he said afterwards. “Today was probably the first game I was truly happy with my all-round performance.” Kane said he and his teammates “feel fit and sharp” despite their World Cup exertions and that it was important to prove the point. His first-half penalty, lashed past Ryan, was certainly not the finish of a player lacking confidence and he will hope the dust has settled on what – by his and Tottenham’s high standards – has been a turbulent spell. Nick AmesLeague tables may never lie but they can certainly lead to false conclusions. This was not the result anyone would have expected after the start each club made though, with Burnley experience of his own, Eddie Howe probably had a shrewd idea the club who were bottom at kick-off would be anxious to stage a revival. Sean Dyche’s side did just that and, though the manager deserves credit for promoting Matej Vydra to score the all-important first goal – Burnley had not previously taken the lead in the league all season – he was also rewarded for his continued faith in Aaron Lennon. End product has not always been the winger’s strong point and his recent form must have put him among the candidates to be rested or dropped, yet with a well-taken goal and two assists the 31-year-old fully justified his continued selection. Paul WilsonPep Guardiola witnessed his Manchester City return to their ruthless selves and, while thrashing relegation favourites Cardiff is unlikely to hold the key to their hopes of retaining the title, it was another baby step on their mission. On Tuesday, they travel to Oxford United in the Carabao Cup as they continue to fight for silverware on four fronts, that blip in the Champions League seemingly been and gone. “The first priority is the Premier League, that is the nicest one,” Guardiola said. “When I see three teams like Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus, and in 10 years, they have won seven leagues, they show me they are the best teams. We want to be consistent and solid in that competition, and after in the knockout games to improve from the mistakes we have had in the past. We are going to try.” Ben FisherHe may not like to admit it but Roy Hodgson has a problem. The failure to see off a limited Newcastle side meant Crystal Palace have won just four times at Selhurst Park in the Premier League this year, having failed to find the net at home in any of their three fixtures there this campaign. The lack of goalscoring alternatives to Wilfried Zaha was all too evident against Newcastle, with Jordan Ayew doing his best to impersonate the injured Christian Benteke with an ineffective performance. A reported agreement to end the dispute between the club and supporters’ group the Holmesdale Fanatics could help restore the vibrant atmosphere the club has become known for in time for their next home match against Wolves, although Hodgson must also address his side’s obvious lack of creativity. Ed AaronsFulham came up with a deserved reputation as the best footballing side in the Championship and have surrendered nothing of their aesthetic quality in the Premier League. Slavisa Jokanovic is unapologetically cavalier in his approach, something which probably counted against him when Watford decided not to renew his contract in the summer of 2015 despite winning promotion. With Ryan Sessegnon bombing on from left-back, Jean-Michaël Seri pulling strings in midfield and Luciano Vietto and André Schürrle supporting Aleksandar Mitrovic, they had Watford reeling for the last 30 minutes. Fulham’s continuing problem is defending that would be unacceptable in the second tier. Jokanovic’s reshuffle of his back four resulted in an error-strewn first half – Watford should have taken far greater advantage. JBFew Leicester fans pine for Riyad Mahrez, mainly because James Maddison has brought such joy since his arrival from Norwich in the summer. The 21-year-old plays with inventiveness and audacity that make people smile. “You can see his confidence from when the ball came across and he did that Neymar thing with his leg behind the back of his other leg – I just started laughing because I think that’s great,” Jonny Evans said after this Maddison-inspired win against Huddersfield. “I’ve played at Manchester United and Sir Alex at the time always encouraged young players to express themselves and entertain the crowd and it’s great that he can do that.” Claude Puel deserves praise, too, for helping the 21-year-old flourish while giving him more responsibility. “When I saw him in the Championship he played a lot as No 8,” Puel said. “I decided to prepare him to be a No 10 behind the striker because he has the quality.” Paul DoyleJürgen Klopp’s tactical change at half-time against Southampton was understandable. Despite the ease with which Liverpool cruised to a seventh successive win, a club record from the start of the season, the visitors frequently broke behind Klopp’s full-backs in the first half. Reverting to a trusted three-man midfield put an end to that after the break. Still, it was a little harsh that Xherdan Shaqiri was the man to make way for James Milner. The Switzerland international was instrumental in breaking down Mark Hughes’s team on his first Liverpool start and could have moved from a floating role into the forward line in the second half. Klopp explained the thinking behind the substitution to Shaqiri. “I explained it was not because of his performance,” he said. “I’m not worried it will cost his confidence. He is a naturally confident boy, and he will play again. It’s all good.” Andy HunterClub-record signings do not always appear to be specialist substitutes, but then Adama Traoré is an inimitable presence. The statistics highlighted the improbable nature of his contribution at Old Trafford: he had more shots than, and as many dribbles as, passes. No one had more attempts on goal than the player who entered proceedings in the 75th minute no one averages as many dribbles per 90 minutes in the ision, though the Spaniard’s time on the pitch amounts to just 131 minutes. If his role as the impact substitute owes something to Helder Costa and Diogo Jota’s effectiveness as starters, it seems a bespoke tactic designed to target tiring left-backs. Traoré accelerated beyond the luckless Luke Shaw at will. But for David de Gea, he would have conjured a winner, just as he scored a late decider at West Ham in another explosive cameo. Richard JollyAlmost as much as the four points they very much needed after a fruitless opening month, perhaps the most encouraging thing for West Ham from their last two fixtures is they looked like they had a plan. Against Everton they played with some attacking purpose, striking at just the right times to efficiently bag three points, while on Sunday they were rather more circumspect but no less organised, creating a defensive block that Chelsea could not find a way through – no small feat given their perfect record until that point. All of which is especially welcome, as it was a lack of direction that was nearly as concerning as the defeats. Manuel Pellegrini’s team is still most certainly a work in progress, and a lack of attacking penetration without Marko Arnautovic is a worry, but there are at least some promising signs.

The most popular baby names of 2017 have been announced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), and while Olivia, Oliver and Muhammad – in its varied spellings – remain the most likely names to be heard shouted across the nation’s playgrounds in years to come, the inventiveness of parents shows no sign of slowing down.Aurora, Lyla, Orla, Edith and Hallie enter the top 100 girls’ names, while for boys, popular names include Leo, which enters the top 10, and Ralph, moving into the top 100.Sarah, the most popular name for girls throughout much of the 1970s and 1980s, has dropped out of the top 100 for the first time since records began in 1904.Parents in England and Wales gave 28,222 different names to the 348,071 boys born last year, and 35,475 to the 331,035 girls. More parents seem to be aiming for something celestial, with Luna and Aria among the fastest-rising girls’ names in the past decade.The biggest climber was Harper, the name David and Victoria Beckham gave to their youngest child in 2011. Music and sport often provide inspiration, with 35 parents plumping for Kendrick for boys – perhaps with the rapper Kendrick Lamar in mind – and 50 calling their boys Kobe, possibly after the basketball player Kobe Bryant.However, the British political class does not inspire people so much. There is no Boris, Jeremy or Theresa in either of the top 100s, although Jacob was the sixth-most popular name in 2017, a year in which the arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg has grown in popularity in some quarters. There were only 11 Nigels born last year, compared with 50 Winstons.The names given to the newborns of England and Wales present a different and more erse picture than those registered when Britain joined the EU in 1973. Back then, Michael and Jennifer were the most popular names.There is also considerable regional variation. In Gwynedd, north Wales, Hari is the most popular name given to boys. In Blackburn, it is Zainab for girls. Amelia and Muhammad are most popular in Birmingham, Jack and Olivia in Bristol, and Arthur, Oscar, Florence and Lily in Tunbridge Wells.Muhammad was the 10th most popular name for boys, but if the alternative spellings of Mohammed or Mohammad were included, it would be about as popular as Oliver and its variants, such as Olly, across England and Wales, the ONS said.Two names that do not appear in the top 100s are Walt and Boo, the twins born this week to Chris Evans and Natasha Shishmanian, who had earlier nicknamed the boy and girl Ping and Pong, which do not appear either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/879f3398a3e8821d5cd2313b346deb2b216eeab6/0_427_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e4e64ecac664de94e8fdb98c5ac8dfc","title":"how do i best use the three hours a day i spend commuting","story":"Whether it’s drafting emails or reading, make the most of this me-time, says Sharmadean ReidI spend three hours a day commuting: how do I best use this time?I love a commute. It’s rare “me-time” that allows you to do whatever you want, but I’ve realised that different modes of transport, times of day and routes call for very different pastimes. If I’m travelling cross-country and manage to get a table seat on a train, the first thing I do is go through all my emails and tee up replies. Don’t attempt to use the train wifi – you’ll waste half the journey trying to connect. Open your laptop or phone, and start drafting all your emails. Not only will you go into work with a clear head and plate, but you’ll get a little dopamine hit when you hear the multiple whooshes of emails flying off when you do connect to your office wifi.If working that early in the morning isn’t your thing, then read. Take a slim volume you can fit into your bag or pocket and whip it out when the time gods bless you with 10 minutes. I got into the terrible habit of not reading on short tube journeys, when you can get through quite a few pages and thoughts (even on my nine-minute tube commute in London). I love the Penguin Great Ideas series for little books of big ideas that get my mind ticking before I start my day.If your commute is on a packed bus or train with little space, I recommend long-form podcasts or playlists. Spotify has the best algorithm of all streaming services. I start with one song and let the radio decide what’s next. With podcasts, I tend to choose ones that are at least an hour and flip between startup advice or things unrelated to my work, such as a series on an imaginary mission to Mars (Anatomy Of Next).Three hours a day is enough to do a part-time degree, learn a language or write a novel you have the freedom to decide how to use your most precious asset.

Two  journalists give it a tryCoco Khan, 30, has worked for the  since 2016, as a writer and columnistNearly everyone has had that entry-level job – the one with the manager who doesn’t remember your name, the director who takes leadership lessons from Machiavelli and the colleague who still can’t use the printer even though you have shown them a thousand times. That’s being a junior, and not being taken seriously. You look forward to clocking off, when you can moan or laugh about it with friends. After all, everybody has been there. And one day, when you’re more experienced, the juniors will probably be moaning about you.But over the past decade or so, the natural cycle has become interrupted, with the generation gap growing from a mild irritation into a major ide. Millennials complain that they will never be able to buy their own homes, raise children or retire in comfort because the baby boomers and Generation X have squeezed all the goodness out of the economy. Their elders, meanwhile, grumble about hipster beards, a culture of entitlement and salaries frittered away on turmeric lattes and iPhones. Each side blames the other everyone is talking, but no one is listening.As the Resolution Foundation put it this year in a report on generational inequality: “Society rests on an intergenerational contract – the principle that different generations provide support to each other across the different stages of their lives … That contract is now under threat.”So what kind of workplace does Gen Y want to toil in? Broadly speaking, one that reflects inclusive values. That means a workplace with ersity across all levels, fair and equal pay, flexible hours, an understanding of mental health issues (which disproportionately affect younger people) and a collaborative rather than hierarchical culture. Think of it as work for purpose, rather than simply work for pay (which, incidentally, has been stagnant since many millennials were children).There have been attempts to accelerate this change in culture, from active recruitment of underrepresented groups to bans on all-male interview shortlists. But one lesser-known initiative is gaining momentum, backed by bosses and workers across Silicon Valley and the City: reverse mentoring. Ryan Holmes, the founder of the tech firm Hootsuite, says he has “come to rely on it”. Inga Beale, the former CEO of Lloyds of London, says: “It helps me be inspired.”The concept was popularised in the late 90s by the then boss of General Electric, Jack Welch. Observing the growing impact of the internet, he asked his most senior employees to meet new recruits and find out about the technology they were using. It turned out to be beneficial for everybody. The senior workers got insights into the latest tech and met people they could champion through the business the newer recruits got a line to the top.Current reverse mentoring schemes work in much the same way: pair a senior worker with a more junior colleague in their company, for mutual nurturing. What better way to break down stereotypes and biases, get fresh perspectives on life and work and create opportunities for everyone?But is it really that simple? Isn’t workplace inequality a reflection of larger social problems? What can a few coffees with a colleague really do?I wanted to put it to the test, but first I’d need to find the right mentor – someone who could benefit from what I can offer (namely, wokeness and meme knowledge) and offer me advice. Enter Stephen Moss,  feature writer.A suitable mentor is someone who is senior, but isn’t your line manager. They should have a good understanding of the nature of your work, usually because they work in your field. If your department isn’t quite big enough, then people in departments with a degree of overlap (eg, marketing if you are in sales) can also prove valuable.In my case, Stephen is a writer like me, but has held a range of positions in the paper. In fact, he has been at the  about as long as I have been alive, so I was confident that he would be a fount of knowledge. I hoped I might be able to add value to him by being a go-to person for any technology or identity politics questions. Indeed, it is the equality in a setup like this that drew me to it. Discussing workplace identity issues can often become heated, particularly if speaking to a senior colleague – and there is always a risk of being marked out as a troublemaker. It is also emotionally burdensome and this can be enough to stop people speaking up. But in reverse mentoring, both sides have expressly agreed to be open and to learn from each other.“What you want to get out of reverse mentoring is up to you,” says Beth Stallwood of Moving Ahead, an organisation that specialises in mentoring schemes in the workplace and works with FTSE 250 companies. “But what this arrangement allows is a fair space for someone to ‘speak truth to power’.”Think of it like this. Even if the senior mentor isn’t the one with decision-making power, perhaps they have discussions with the person who is. You telling the mentor that you disagree with a policy, for example, can be fed back and spark a conversation across all levels of the business.Stephen fits the bill for a mentor, but with the slight problem that he is not convinced by the whole thing. Another caveat: mentoring usually takes place over nine months to a year. We only have a few months.“The first thing we ask all our participants to do,” says Stallwood, “is to agree some aims. You will then use those to shape your sessions and keep track of progress. A simple method would be to mark each session out of 10, against your aims.”I wanted some advice on managing time, having focus and building my confidence. Stephen wanted to know more about the millennial way of thinking and where he should best direct his journalistic energy. His question? “Why am I still here?”We met in and around our office, as well as taking two field trips, one chosen by me and one by Stephen.These early meetings did confirm some generational stereotypes. Coco, 30, lefty millennial, loves earnestness and smashing patriarchyavocado Stephen, 61, centrist and cynic, uses “smashing” as a word for good. But even our most caricatured sides have nuances that make for a worthwhile discussion.For example, I was never going to persuade Stephen to take an interest in identity politics, but I could at least outline why such lines of thinking have value to me. I think this message landed. Equally, Stephen’s assertion that he is “too old to change” gave me pause (is anyone ever too old to change?) and it has certainly made me think more about age when discussing inclusivity. So far, so good.But it wasn’t without its hiccups. Upon reflection, I think it was probably a mistake to answer Stephen’s “Why am I here?” with, “Are you having an absolute laugh, mate? Your career is great, your life is wicked, you own a house and can retire, you can probably do whatever you want and I bet you have better breakfasts than me,” before dropping into my own existential crisis about having to work until I die. But what is reverse mentoring if not a learning curve?Stephen’s choice for an excursion was to the Royal Albert Hall, to listen to some classical music as part of the Proms. In truth, these trips didn’t do much to enhance or transform the advice-giving bit, but certainly played a role in building a rapport and giving us discussion points (“Why are there so few BAME audience members and is that man in the cravat wearing those red trousers ironically?”). I enjoyed hearing something new and having my world extended in a direction it might not otherwise have gone, as well as watching Stephen accidentally insult the Proms press officer by telling her that for our next session we’d going “somewhere trendy”. “Are you saying the Proms aren’t trendy?”Said “trendy” session – as chosen by me – took place in Hackney in east London, in a row of shops under some railway arches. They are painfully millennial spaces – probably everyone who visits has a creative job, eats organic and buys vinyl – but where else can you get a coffee, eat lunch, go shopping, get a haircut and get your bike fixed? I took Stephen for a coffee and a haircut to give him an insight into the millennial life, where work bleeds into leisure and the “always-on” culture that defines my generation. Also, I thought it would be funny to see Stephen navigate a vegan coffee on a hammock. I was right.But the key question in all of this is, did it work? For me, yes. The advice I received was relevant and helpful. I’ll give you an example: when I told Stephen that I feel stressed out writing about race because of an unsaid expectation that I am speaking on behalf of others, he said: “I never write for anyone else. I write only for myself. I also happen to think I am a brilliant writer.” A playful, yet ultimately insightful comment from a former literary editor and an energy I later channelled when arguing with a publisher about edits I felt were strong-arming me into something I didn’t want.And that is the best part of mentoring. There’s the exchange of information, sure, but there is also the emotional side – the feeling of being better supported at work, that someone has your back and that someone is listening. Stephen and I are very different, and have had different experiences. Meeting him didn’t change my view of generational inequality, but speaking about our views in a setup where the express aim was to help one another, rather than win, has inched the needle. We’ll be continuing the relationship after this piece. Frankly, with more time, I think full woke-ification could occur.Stephen Moss, 61, has worked at the  since 1989, as an editor and writerI have never been much of a mentor. Twentysomethings occasionally used to come to me and ask how they could get a break in journalism. I suggested going to some under-reported hotspot and making the place their own journalism-wise, if necessary fomenting a revolution so they had lots to report on. I never heard from any of them again.Reverse mentoring sounded more my thing. This was all about me. Except there was, I quickly realised, a fundamental problem: at 61 I’m too old to learn anything new. I don’t want to join Instagram I refuse to use WhatsApp. I tweet (therefore I am), but that is about it. Engaging with Coco was fascinating – how could it not be when we are so different in every way? – but I was sceptical about whether we could teach each other anything.Coco, I learned at our initial getting-to-know-each-other session, is 30 she is of Pakistani heritage and was brought up by her mother her family was poor, she suffered racial abuse, she did brilliantly to get to the University of Warwick, where she studied English literature she had a terrific essay-cum-short-story published in the bestselling 2016 book The Good Immigrant, produced another while she and I were in touch, and has an agent who is pressing her to get on with a novel.She set out some aims at the beginning of our mentoring relationship: “I would like to understand how to create longevity in a writing career – I worry that I have millennial cachet at the moment, but that will fade. I would like to better understand the various paths laid out for a writer. I need help figuring out where to direct energy and what is a waste of time. (Public speaking – useful or not? Being a specialist or a generalist – which makes for a longer lasting career?) I need help with my confidence.”Her confidence seems fine, unless she is a consummate actor. Her quickfire intelligence and ambition certainly terrified me. Young people think there is some great secret to life and success. There isn’t. We are all floundering almost all the time.I set out some hastily assembled aims, too, but there was only one that really mattered and I saw her write it down assiduously: Why am I still here? After almost 30 years on the paper, I am thoroughly institutionalised, my identity hopelessly bound up with the ’s. I’ve never even had an email address that wasn’t a work one. Post-, I fear I would cease to exist.More positively, as I explained to Coco, I feel Brexit is the issue of my lifetime: how this plays out over the next few years will define the country for generations. It would be perverse to walk away now. I am also fascinated by how a liberal paper, which the  is at heart and by tradition, navigates the rise of populism. I would argue that having the odd crotchety old journo around to offer a leavening of experience at this critical juncture could be handy, though I can see others may think differently.It was useful and productive to talk to someone from a different generation and with a radically different perspective. We agreed on very little politically, but she managed to make a few small cracks in my dormant social conscience. She calls me a cynic, which I think is unfair. I admit I will never be “woke” I am suspicious of all mechanistic ideologies and am much more attracted to, say, Confucius than to Marx. But I am aware – and contact with Coco has made me more aware – that I have to play my part. Not just in reversing the disaster of Brexit, but in remaking our ided, unequal, blinkered society.I don’t think I have been changed fundamentally – having a haircut at the multitasking Hurwundeki and vegan coffee at the Love Shack in Hackney was fun, but I’m unlikely to become a regular. Nonetheless, something has changed: I’m at least in contact with someone from the next generation at the , and we have agreed to go on meeting regularly. My first question to her when we next meet will be why do all the young women in ultra-hip east London dress like Frida Kahlo and all the men like 50 Cent? It isn’t like this in Surbiton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ce29e173287767c534c94d5812b84e6a16411a6/123_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c53f0e660980592b4091c97cf9ed9fe","title":"aping each other how similar are humans and orangutans","story":"From umbrella-making to learning how to self-medicate, we share plenty of skills with our fellow great apesWhen scientists talk about animals using tools, they’re not normally talking about the implements you might use to knock up some shelves.

Captive orangutans have been taught to use hammers, screwdrivers and keys.Researchers have even shown that orangutans learn and generate new sounds – an ability until recently considered largely the preserve of humans. The ability to consciously vibrate twin bands of muscle tissue in the larynx called vocal folds – important in generating many new sounds – was thought to have evolved after we erged from chimpanzees, our closest great ape relatives, some 5-7m years ago.Then, an international team of researchers caught wind of reports of a male orangutan called Rocky using sounds reminiscent of the plaintive groans made by Chewbacca, of Star Wars fame, to attract the attention of his keepers at Indianapolis Zoo. In a study published in 2016, the group compared Rocky’s call to other known orangutan sounds and found it to be novel.They then taught him to imitate a human who was making versions of his call at different pitches. “This shows the ability to change the frequency of calls through control of the vocal folds was likely to have predated the last common ancestor of humans and orangutans,” says Prof Serge Wich, of Liverpool John Moores University, one of the study’s authors.Orangutans have also been shown to have human-like, long-term memories. In 2009, Danish scientists showed a group of orangutans and chimps how to retrieve a piece of banana by reaching through a slot with the longer of two sticks, and then hid the sticks in boxes in nearby rooms. Three years later, all bar one of the orangutans knew what to do to get the food in the same set-up.Just as the list of tool-using animals has grown in recent years, so too has the list of those that use plants as medicine. Lizards eat certain roots to counter snake venom, macaws consume clay to aid digestion as well as to gain minerals, and pregnant lemurs nibble tamarind and fig leaves to boost milk production. Orangutans are among a smaller group of primates that self-medicate by rubbing substances into their fur.Behavioural ecologist Helen Morrogh-Bernard, of Exeter University, and co-director of the Borneo Nature Foundation, last year reported observing child-bearing female orangutans chewing the leaves of the shrub Dracaena cantleyi to form a soapy foam that they then rub into their upper arms or legs. Chemical analysis showed it has anti-inflammatory properties. Local people use the same plant as pain relief. Unlike many other similarities between orangutans and humans, this one has cultural rather than evolutionary roots. And not in the way you might think. “When we surveyed local people,” says Morrogh-Bernard, “they told us their ancestors started using a number of plants as medicines after seeing orangutans doing so.”So our two species are very similar – to the extent that we sometimes even have things to learn from them.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

But palm oil cultivation in south-east Asia is clearing forests and contributing to the decline of orangutans. Here are the key points Think back over the past week in your life. If you’ve applied lipstick, eaten toast or put on a load of washing, chances are, you’ve used a product containing palm oil. Indulged in ice-cream or washed your hair? Palm oil. According to the World Wildlife Fund: “It is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket.” And it’s linked to the destruction of the rainforest and many of the species that reside in it.To stop palm oil being listed as “vegetable oil” or as one of a long list of hard to pronounce synonyms, an EU law was passed in 2014, stating that all food products containing palm oil should be labelled clearly. But the same cannot be said for cosmetics and household products in which palm oil is often used.Indonesia is home to some of the most bioerse areas in the world, including the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers, rhinos and sun bears coexist naturally. The Tropical Heritage Rainforest of Sumatra – of which the Leuser ecosystem is a part – is a Unesco world heritage site, but it’s still in danger from palm oil plantations, pulp production and infrastructure projects. Orangutans are keystone species, which, according to National Geographic, means they help define entire ecosystems. If a keystone species – sea otters, elephants, honey bees, for example – disappears, no other species can fill its shoes, and the ecosystem changes irrevocably. Mainstream media now regularly covers palm oil, campaigns such as Say No to Palm Oil have sprung up and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil runs a certification system, which aims to ensure all palm oil with its stamp comes from sustainably managed plantations. Genuine change is yet to occur, however, prompting campaigners to put pressure on brands that use palm oil, urging them to use their power to genuinely reform their suppliers.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

Commentators were downright scathing.Sheila Sitalsing in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant said May had “stormed the European continent like a Don Quixote”, Chequers plan and Brexit conditions under her arm: Britain wanted to “keep playing footie and snacking at the canteen, without paying any subs, wearing the club strip or doing bar duty”.The EU27 had “sent her packing in Salzburg”, Sitalsing said, where May had “desperately sought to win sympathy for a Brexit that would not send her population straight back to the Middle Ages”.Her threat that if she was replaced things might get worse “did not impress” EU leaders – but May still seems to believe their hard line “is just a negotiating tactic”. She has got it all wrong: “Poor Theresa May. Poor United Kingdom.”In the Spanish paper El Pais, Álvaro Imbernon Sainz said that since May took office in July 2016, her entire negotiating strategy had been “to postpone decision-making as much as possible, without putting together any kind of clear vision” – but the chickens were now coming home to roost.“The problem is that the differences between the two sides are not technical, but on fundamental principles, and time is beginning to run out,” he said. “Like a bad student who puts off the moment to sit down and study, it’s now up to the UK to make up for lost time.”Britain must “rediscover British pragmatism. For this, the Conservatives, and to a lesser extent Labour, must agree on a coherent and realistic position. Otherwise the historians of the future will be extremely hard on the current British political class”.In France, Le Figaro said May had been “caught in the trap of her ‘it’s me or chaos’” strategy. The prime minister’s Brexit plan was “dead and buried”, the paper said, after she “put her allies up against the wall” by insisting a no deal was the only alternative. “Unfortunately, her plan has met unanimous opposition.”For Le Monde, the EU27 had made plain that “the moment of truth” had come. The bloc’s leaders were “clearly singing from the same hymn sheet” and used the summit to sound the alarm, the paper said: “Brexit talks are in the closing straight – and the EU27 have, for the moment, no intention whatever of softening their stance.”The meeting was above all aimed at “putting maximum pressure on the British prime minister a few days ahead of her party’s annual conference”, it said, adding that the October final deadline set by Donald Tusk, the European council president, for progress on the Irish border was clearly significant.The paper quoted the French president, Emmanuel Macron, saying he had “perfectly summed up” the Europeans’ position on Brexit: Chequers “is not acceptable because it does not respect the integrity of the single market … Leaving the EU cannot be done without costs or consequences.”Tusk “flatly rejected Britain’s plan for future EU-UK trade relations”, wrote Germany’s Die Welt, adding that the EU27 had “categorically thrown out” May’s Chequers plan quite simply “because it fears it would lead to unfair competition from British firms”. Brexit talks, the paper said, “are deadlocked”.The Frankfurter Algemeine Zeitung took the same line, quoting Tusk as saying “May’s Brexit plan will not work” and that negotiations were now at a standstill after “both sides camped firmly on their positions and no agreement was reached”.The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad said the EU 27 had “approached the British prime minister positively, but given little away”. Britain had “high hopes” of the summit, it said, but “the harvest was meagre”.The EU was walking a tightrope, the paper said: it had to be reasonably positive towards May while not budging, because: “British political drama is the greatest uncertainty around Brexit, and the horror scenario is that whatever is agreed with May proves worthless if she is replaced.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e7b1c630b893a1f544ffd0daaa54ee4ddd4b9b4/0_77_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=044473389bc76ff0448bb7c26968136b","title":"theresa may demands respect from eu in brexit negotiations","story":"PM gives combative speech after rejection of Chequers plan, stoking ‘no deal’ fearsTheresa May has accused the European Union of not treating the UK with respect in a deliberately combative address that prompted a sharp fall in the pound amid fears that it made a no deal Brexit more likely.Twenty-four hours after her Salzburg humiliation, the prime minister gave a hastily arranged televised Downing Street statement in an effort to reassert herself.Speaking from a lectern with two union flags behind her, May tried to accuse her counterparts of bad faith: “I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.”Her remarks came a day after the Salzburg summit where EU leaders frustrated by May’s insistence on sticking rigidly to her controversial Chequers negotiating plan embarrassed her when the EU council president, Donald Tusk, unexpectedly declared it “would not work”.May retaliated on Friday: “Yesterday, Donald Tusk said our proposals would undermine the single market. He didn’t explain how in any detail or make any counter-proposal. So we are at an impasse.” She called on the EU to spell out “what their alternative is”.But Tusk, the European council president, hit back hard at the prime minister, accusing her of bringing a “surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising” attitude to the Salzburg summit. He denied May’s claims that the EU had failed to explain its position to the British negotiators, claiming to have spelled out the problems in detail in recent weeks, although he insisted that “a compromise, good for all, is still possible”.Despite the heated rhetoric and plunge in sterling, EU officials are understood to be working on a counter-proposal to the Chequers plan, which is likely to appear in early October, after the Conservative party conference and a week before a make or break Brexit summit in Brussels.No 10 is calculating May can win support by appearing to stand up to the EU, although her critics in the party believe this would be the moment to give up the Chequers plan, or risk facing hostile activists at the party’s annual conference in just over a week.Several cabinet ministers put out statements of support. Penny Mourdant, the international development secretary, again emphasised the possibility of a no deal, saying that while voters “still want a deal” they would be “content to go without one, even folk who voted remain”.But Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said that Salzburg was a failure and repeated that it was time to abandon Chequers. “There is still no reason to suppose that Chequers can work either for the UK or the EU.”Chequers proposes that the UK shares a common rulebook for goods and services after Brexit in an attempt to prevent a return of customs checks for goods crossing the Irish border, a plan so unpopular on the right of the Tory party that Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned rather than support it.That would imply the UK would have to align itself more broadly to EU rules after Brexit to avoid a return to a hard border in Ireland, a proposal that could be difficult for May to sell to her party.Hard Brexiters will step up their campaign against Chequers in the run up to the Tory party conference on Monday. D Davis and other senior rightwing politicians are expected to attend an event at which alternative “Canada plus” trade proposals will be announced.The EU, however, has said that while it would be prepared to discuss a Canada-style deal, that would mean not just taking the UK out of the single market and customs union, it would also mean the return of border controls in Ireland.The prime minister also signalled that the UK would unilaterally safeguard the rights of the EU citizens living in the country in an attempt to reassure them that the impasse in negotiations would not affect their status.“There are over 3 million EU citizens living in the UK who will be understandably worried about what the outcome of yesterday’s summit means for their future. I want to be clear with you that even in the event of no deal your rights will be protected. You are our friends, our neighbours, our colleagues. We want you to stay,” May said.Ministers are expected to confirm details in a couple of weeks, after the party conference season.The prime minister repeatedly rejected an EU backstop proposal that would see Northern Ireland remain inside the customs union if the UK was unable to agree a free trade agreement with Brussels in the orce talks.Ratcheting up the language on the issue, May said: “It is something I will never agree to – indeed, in my judgment it is something no British prime minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.”In a rare direct criticism of a serving prime minister, Tusk made reference to the criticisms of Michel Barnier by the British government, and the refusal of the British side to work on a solution to the Irish border issue by October, as previously promised.“The UK stance presented just before and during the Salzburg meeting was surprisingly tough and in fact uncompromising”, he said. “The response of the EU27 leaders was to reiterate our trust in chief negotiator Michel Barnier and to reiterate our position on the integrity of the single market and the Irish backstop.But he added: “While understanding the logic of the negotiations, I remain convinced that a compromise, good for all, is still possible. I say these words as a close friend of the UK and a true admirer of PM May.” Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, criticised both the prime minister and the EU: “Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.“From day one, the prime minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our government need to end because no deal is not an option.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/299bb221f3e18c052956f4e1bcd40a3f86d178cc/0_89_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3db2fe8d3f6b0a86134e460078ace3c0","title":"mcdonnell new brexit referendum should not include remain option","story":"Shadow chancellor says he would back second referendum but only if it is a ‘vote on the deal itself’A fresh Brexit referendum should be only about a departure deal and should not include the option of staying in the EU, John McDonnell has indicated, in comments likely to dismay Labour members pushing for a so-called people’s vote.The shadow chancellor said he would back the idea of a new referendum if a general election did not happen. But he argued that while it was up to parliament to decide the question, he believed it should be just “a vote on the deal itself”.“If we are going to respect the last referendum, it will be about the deal, it will a negotiation on the deal,” McDonnell said.The party’s conference in Liverpool is likely to pass a statement thrashed out by delegates late on Sunday that commits Labour to keeping the option of a second referendum on the table.After a gruelling five-hour meeting with the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, more than 100 delegates from trade unions and local parties drafted a two-page motion, which members were expected to pass on Tuesday.The key sentence of the final draft says: “If we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote.”The statement has prompted concern from some allies of Jeremy Corbyn, with Len McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, saying he did not think “remain” should be an option on the ballot paper.Asked about the issue on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, McDonnell said: “If we don’t get a general election then yes, we’ll go for a people’s vote.”Quizzed about what options should be part of a second referendum question, he said: “My view at the moment is that parliament will decide what will be on that ballot paper. We’ll be arguing that it should be a vote on the deal itself, and then enable us to go back and do the negotiations.”Pressed on whether this definitely meant ruling out a “remain” option, McDonnell declined to fully clarify, but indicated again this was the case: “We’re respecting the referendum. We want a general election, If we can’t get that we’ll have a people’s vote. The people’s vote will be on the deal itself and whether we can negotiate a better one.”He added: “Parliament will determine the nature of the question that will be put, but the first stage of that is to see if we can get a deal that is acceptable and brings the country together again. And I’ve always thought we could.”McDonnell’s caution is likely to disappoint Labour members pushing for a second referendum. A “people’s vote” was overwhelmingly the most popular issue raised by constituency Labour parties (CLPs) that submitted so-called “contemporary motions” to conference.The final draft of the statement agreed with Starmer said: “If the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from, they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.”Campaigners were pleased with other elements of the two-page statement, including a promise to pursue “full participation in the single market”.One anti-Brexit Labour source said: “This is clear movement from the party. We are now talking with clarity of voting down the deal if doesn’t meet our tests, calling for a general election and if that is not possible – we want a public vote on the deal.“Last year we didn’t even get a debate. What a difference a year makes.”An initial motion that proposed a a public vote on the terms of Brexit was rejected by delegates as being too prescriptive, as it appeared to exclude the option to remain within the EU.Michael Chessum, one of the key anti-Brexit campaigners from the leftwing group Another Europe is Possible, said it was not everything they had hoped for, but a step forward. “A huge anti-Brexit surge of Labour members has hit Labour conference. It hasn’t been fully reflected in the text – but we have a clear commitment that any public vote won’t just be on the terms of Brexit. It could include an option to remain,” he said.Several of Corbyn’s senior supporters underlined their concerns about what they see as the risks of a “people’s vote”.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, whose Salford constituency voted leave, told the  she was concerned the Tories would be able to dictate the question.“My worry about a second referendum is that they will be holding the pen,” she said. “What will the referendum be on?”She added that some Labour-supporting leave voters might feel the party did not trust them. “I do worry about it, because I think a lot of people will feel sold-out,” she said. “Some people will think: ‘How many times do you ask before you get the answer you want?’”Another shadow cabinet minister, Richard Burgon, warned of what he called “a dangerous situation for the whole political class”.People’s Vote campaigners held a well-attended rally in Liverpool on Sunday, close to the conference centre."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47abade6e5e2bb107d206d503019614bec2d3fae/0_228_4320_2591/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=155d77da4116310843395fcff5438a22","title":"pm urged to drop chequers in order to win brexit prize","story":"Author of plan backed by senior pro-leave Tories says PM’s proposal is damage limitation exerciseThe author of a new plan for Brexit backed by senior pro-leave Conservatives has urged the government to abandon the Chequers proposal, saying it would leave a post-departure UK unable to benefit economically from its new place in the world.Shanker Singham from the Institute for Economic Affairs (IEA) thinktank, who was to launch the plan later on Monday, said Theresa May’s Chequers proposal had approached Brexit “from the wrong end of the telescope” by failing to examine its global impact.May had talked of a “Brexit prize” in her Lancaster House speech, Singham told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, but the extent of continued alignment with the EU needed in Chequers lost this.“Our approach is: well, what is that prize?” he said. “I think that prize is entirely to be found in your independent trade and regulatory policy. It is nowhere else. If you don’t have an independent trade and regulatory policy as you leave the EU, then this is only a damage limitation exercise. It can only be a bad result.”Under the IEA proposals, the UK would seek a “basic” free trade agreement for goods, with the government also opening simultaneous discussions on securing long-term free trade deals with countries including the US, China and India.The EU deal would be initially based on convergence, with “mechanisms to mitigate or manage the differences as you go forward”, Singham said.The former Brexit secretary David Davis, who quit the government over the Chequers plan, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chairman of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, are among the speakers listed for the report’s launch in London.One of the key objections to such free trade-based Brexit plans has been how to avoid a hard Irish border.Singham insisted this was possible: “Our proposal is designed to avoid a hard border in the island of Ireland, and we have an extensive section on how you would deal with the Irish border, which would include a number of customs-related mitigants.”This would involve a range of elements, including the use of technology, and of trusted trader scheme, he said.“We are talking about things on the Irish border that actually operate in the rest of the world,” he said. “Every day these mechanisms are used, and we believe that together – there’s no one thing we would do – if you do all of the things we suggest, you will avoid hardening the border.”The report argues that under Chequers, it would be “all but impossible” for Britain to conduct an independent trade policy.“The UK running its own economy will not render a deal with the EU impossible,” it says. “It will bring back real growth, let the UK do other trade deals, and create leverage to get positive results from EU negotiations.”It says Britain should seek to keep the elements of the withdrawal agreement which have already been agreed, including those covering citizens’ rights, the “orce” bill and the 21-month transition period after the UK leaves in March 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/5/1399294269797/Libby-Brooks.jpg?width=140\u0026amp;height=140\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c24da21f9bbc736be7bad58838a7214d\" alt=\"Libby Brooks","title":"theresa may makes statement outside no 10","story":"Prime minister says UK needs to hear from EU on what real alternatives areThat’s all from the blog today, thanks so much for your comments. You can read the full story here:Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described May’s statement as “dreadful” and her tactics “hugely damaging”.“The Prime Minister’s statement was dreadful. The EU’s view of the Chequers plan was bluntly and clearly expressed in Salzburg yesterday, but should not have come as a surprise to the UK Government, given that it was not a new position.“Clearly, the Prime Minister has not been listening – Chequers is a dead duck but if her tactic now is to try and double down on those proposals and then seek to blame the EU for a no-deal outcome, then she will do huge damage to all of those she is supposed to serve.“It would be an abdication of responsibility of huge and historic proportions and an approach for which Theresa May and the Tory party would pay a very heavy political price, especially in Scotland, which overwhelmingly rejected Brexit and whose interests in this process have been ignored at every turn by the UK Government.“What the latest development shows more clearly than ever is that the only remotely workable way for Brexit to happen is for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union. If the Prime Minister is not prepared to do that, then Brexit shouldn’t happen. A ‘No deal’ or ‘no detail‘ Brexit are simply not acceptable – particularly for Scotland, where we did not vote for any of this.”Yesterday, Sturgeon wrote to the leaders of the UK’s opposition parties asking them to join her in pressing for an extension to next March’s deadline for leaving the EU to avoid “an economic cliff edge”.Cabinet ministers have been responding on Twitter, including some warning the EU in stronger terms.The Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who has been an advocate for a soft Brexit, said she has spoken to May this afternoon and been reassured of her commitment to get a negotiated deal.Business leaders have reacted with some alarm to the comments by the prime minister on the distance between the two sides.CBI director Carolyn Fairbairn said negotiators on both sides must change tack. “Rejection of Chequers helps nobody,” she said. “Pragmatism must come before politics. Every day lost in rhetoric is lost investment and lost jobs.”Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), also reproached both sides for the impasse. “While the Prime Minister’s determination to reach a deal is appreciated, businesses tell us over and over that the time for posturing from both sides is over,” he said. “Many firms are hugely worried about a messy and disorderly outcome, and the potential impact on their ability to trade and grow. Others could be caught flat-footed. Both sides must make every effort to avoid this scenario.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, the chair of the European Reform Group of hard Brexit Tories, said the summit was a “failure” and that the EU was not acting in good faith. However, he praised the prime minister, saying she had showed “steely resolve.”He said it was time to admit the Chequers plan would not work for both the EU and the UK and start making plans for a Canada-style free trade deal. May made it clear in her speech that the EU has said it cannot countenance such a deal without Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union to prevent customs checks on the border.“It is time for the government to start putting forward as its plan a Canada-style free trade agreement for the whole of the UK. This is the most realistic approach and similar to the EU’s proposal,” he said. “Moreover, as every vote in parliament has so far shown, it is the one way which could command a majority in the House of Commons.“On the matter of the UK’s border with Ireland, the EU can have the solutions proposed by the ERG that respect the integrity of the Single Market and which have been supported by the DUP,” he said.“The Prime Minister has shown steely resolve at the eleventh hour and is standing up to the EU bullies. The next step is to say to the EU £40 billion and free trade or World Trade terms.”The pound is on course for its biggest one-day drop in 2018 against the dollar, after Theresa May said Brexit negotiations with the EU had reached an “impasse”.Traders took fright as May’s comments were taken as a sign that a no deal Brexit is an increasingly likely outcome of talks, creating uncertainty which unsettles traders.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that “no deal is not an option” and slammed the government’s negotiating tactics. However, his response does not include a demand that May drop her current plans and, interestingly, also calls on the EU to end the “political games.”Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster. The Tories have spent more time arguing among themselves than negotiating with the EU.From day one, the Prime Minister has looked incapable of delivering a good Brexit deal for Britain. The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option.EU sources were relaxed about May’s speech. They see it as as a “positioning” ahead of the Tory party conference after what they see as a self-inflicted wound in Salzburg.May’s demands that the EU come up with alternative proposals are seen as domestic politicking as the EU’s position in Brexit has been clear from the outset.While May’s failure to come with a proposal on the Irish border nine months after agreeing to one incensed EU leaders, it is said that it was Downing Street’s briefing to British journalists that some member states were being more sympathetic to the UK than others that prompted Macron to intervene. Nigel Dodds, deputy leader of the DUP who back up May’s minority government, said there was “utter inflexibility and bullying tactics” from the EU. He said the EU was not negotiating in good faith or within the parameters of the Belfast agreement. “It seems to be their way or no way,” he told the BBC. He said there would be no regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK that the DUP could accept.Dodds said the issue of Northern Ireland had been “abused” by remainers and EU leaders. “The border issue has been elevated to a far greater extent than it should,” he said. The Lib Dems are the first out of the traps to comment on the prime minister’s statement. The party’s Brexit spokesman Tom Brake says May should recall parliament, an idea unlikely to be popular with Labour who have their party conference next week.Two years down the line and the only consensus the PM has made across Parliament and the EU is that Chequers is unworkable,” he said. Instead of pontificating to television cameras, May must now recall Parliament to explain how she got the country into this terrible mess, what her plan is to get us out of it, and when we can have a people’s vote and an exit from Brexit.Here’s some more of the reaction:From the New Statesman’s Stephen BushFrom the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg:From the ’s Jennifer Rankin:From the WSJ’s Bojan Pancevski:Here are some of the key quotes from May’s statement in Downing Street. On the progress of the negotiations:I have always said that these negotiations would be tough - and they were always bound to be toughest in the final straight. While both sides want a deal, we have to face up to the fact that - despite the progress we have made - there are two big issues where we remain a long way apart. In plain English, this would mean we’d still have to abide by all the EU rules, uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue and we couldn’t do the trade deals we want with other countries. That would make a mockery of the referendum we had two years ago. On a Canada-style free trade deal and a customs border down the Irish Sea: It is something I will never agree to - indeed, in my judgement it is something no British Prime Minister would ever agree to. If the EU believe I will, they are making a fundamental mistake.On the Irish backstop:The EU is proposing to achieve this by effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the Customs Union. As I have already said, that is unacceptable. We will never agree to it. It would mean breaking up our country. We will set out our alternative that preserves the integrity of the UK. On red lines in the negotiations:As I told EU leaders, neither side should demand the unacceptable of the other. We cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of our union, just as they cannot accept anything that threatens the integrity of theirs. We cannot accept anything that does not respect the result of the referendum, just as they cannot accept anything that is not in the interest of their citizens.On her treatment in SalzburgThroughout this process, I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same. A good relationship at the end of this process depends on it.At this late stage in the negotiations, it is not acceptable to simply reject the other side’s proposals without a detailed explanation and counter proposals.On the referendum result: The referendum was the largest democratic exercise this country has ever undergone. To deny its legitimacy or frustrate its result threatens public trust in our democracy. That is why for over two years I have worked day and night to deliver a deal that sees the UK leave the EU. I have worked to bring people with me even when that has not always seemed possible.On the prospect of no deal:No one wants a good deal more than me. But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations. We stand ready.

It’s testing you on the sort of linguistics skills that might help you get you a job at Google, according today’s article in which a Google exec says that an understanding of language is the key to the next giant leap in technology. The roughly two million speakers of Aymara live in the area around Lake Titicaca, the world’s highest navigable lake, in the Andes between Bolivia and Peru. Some of its speakers – the Uros – actually live “on” the lake. Their homes are built on artificial islands, made from woven reeds, that float on the water. Below, seven Uros fishermen describe their catch. Can you work out who caught what? But watch out! One of the fishermen is lying.The puzzle is different from the ones I usually post in this column. In addition to deductive logic and pattern-spotting, you’ll need some basic intuition about languages. Beware: it’s hard. But not impossible.

If you want to print out the problem, click this link here. Here are some tips: isolate all the patterns you can see. Work out which are the likely words for ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’, and ‘fish’. And then curse Aymara for its idiosyncrasies!I’ll be back at 5pm UK time with the solution.Usually here I write (in my shouty voice) NO SPOILERS. There is always someone who ignores my appeal, so if you want to work on the problem with no help DO NOT SCROLL BELOW THE LINE!However, since today’s problem is hard, feel free to mention the patterns that you see and suggest what they might mean.

Todd Blackadder is in his third season in charge at Bath while Chris Boyd moved to Northampton in the summer. Bath’s supremacy up front plus their lineout mastery gave them the platform for victory. Boyd noted how the scrum, a means of launching attacks in New Zealand, is more a means of establishing control in England. Blackadder said he could detect subtle changes in Northampton’s style under Boyd, but after slipping to 10th in the table the basics will be the Saints’ immediate priority. Paul ReesMost agree there are a lot of red cards these days, so let’s not complain when one is not shown. We can, though, muse on how lucky a player has been in this climate. Joe Marler’s forearm to the headneckshoulder of Andy Uren was raised unnaturally high. It did not look good. He escaped with yellow because they reckoned first contact was made on the shoulder, but, if there have to be reds, these acts of extracurricular violence are the sort they should go after. Marler looked more culpable than Will Spencer, who was shown red by the same referee the week before for an honest attempt at a tackle. Michael Aylwin• Match report: Bristol 20-13 Harlequins• Saracens’ McCall wants solution to ‘complicated’ high-tackle situationIf the 37-44 scoreline hints at a vintage game of cut and thrust, the reality was different. Leicester were trailing 37-11 with 22 minutes to go and, despite clawing their way back to 37-37, the Tigers still contrived to throw away all that good work by conceding their sixth try of the afternoon, scored by the highly promising debutant Ted Hill in the left corner in the dying minutes. The Warriors won at Leicester last season as well and there is no longer the same forbidding aura attached to Welford Road. Defensively the Tigers appear to be all at sea and their interim head coach Geordan Murphy must now pray that Sale do not cause a similar upset next weekend. Another disappointing home defeat and the Leicester board will be under huge pressure to change tack again. Robert KitsonNewcastle’s league position after the opening four rounds may look uncomfortable with three defeats, but they became the first team to prevent Exeter from securing a try bonus point when the Chiefs opted to kick their first penalty of the campaign. The Falcons forced Exeter to dig deep and in Simon Hammersley and Zach Kibirige had players whose quick feet took them out of tackles and into space. But Newcastle’s indiscipline allowed Exeter to kick deep and drive mauls, prompting the home side’s director of rugby, Dean Richards, to lament refereeing inconsistency at the breakdown in the league. PRThere is a thesis to be written on the subject of southern hemisphere players commuting back and forth between the Rugby Championship and the English Premiership and whether the clubs concerned would, from a longer-term perspective, be better off resting them. Not many players could do what Willie le Roux did last week: beat the All Blacks in Wellington before flying halfway around the world to help steer Wasps to a bonus-point victory at Sale. His part in Nizaam Carr’s splendid try was further proof that, at this precise moment, the Springbok is rugby’s ultimate Martini man: anytime, any place, anywhere. RK• Jones says old foe Mitchell will get England thinking differentlyMystery surrounds Billy Vunipola’s absence from the Saracens side on Sunday but their director of rugby, Mark McCall, did at least deliver the news that he is not injured and will be available next weekend. He was also fine to report for England duty on Sunday night and it must be said that Saracens did not really miss him – Ben Earl impressing at No 8. “He’s not injured, he was having a medical procedure which has been in the diary for the last two months,” McCall said. “We knew he was missing this game. He’s fine and he’ll be back next week.” Considering his run of injuries over the past 18 months that has to be seen as good news indeed. Gerard MeagherKings rule Last season the Southern Kings lost 20 of their 21 matches in their first Pro14 season so their 38-28 victory against Glasgow, in which they took a 24-0 lead at half-time, can be considered a huge upset, not least because the Warriors were 1-25 with some bookmakers.Zebo zooms Simon Zebo continues to make an impact in the Top 14 after taking his tally to five tries in as many matches with a double in Racing 92’s victory against Castres. The performance of the week came from Bordeaux, however, edging to a 23-19 victory against Clermont, who had won their opening four matches.Shield in trouble The season is only a few weeks old but already a familiar problem has reared its head. Wasps and Gloucester, both citing a lack of front-row resources, have cancelled their Premiership Shield (A League in old money) fixtures against Northampton and Gloucester respectively on Monday.

With threats to its power growing, how long can the company dominate?by  Samuel Gibbs and  Alex HernIn the summer of 1995, a second-year grad student called Sergey Brin was giving a tour of Stanford University to prospective students. Larry Page, an engineering graduate from the University of Michigan, was one of those being shown around the Palo Alto, California campus.“I thought he was pretty obnoxious,” Larry Page said of the encounter. “He had really strong opinions about things, and I guess I did, too.” “We both found each other obnoxious,” said Sergey Brin. “But we say it a little bit jokingly. Obviously we spent a lot of time talking to each other, so there was something thereThe technology of the web at the time meant that you could tell where a webpage links to just by reading its code but the only way to find out where it is linked from is to see it linked to from another page. In other words, to get an exhaustive list of every page that links to, say, stanford.edu, you need to check every other website on the internet.Page’s “Backrub” project aimed to qualify these backlinks, a complex task that not only demanded huge computing resources, but also required extremely complex mathematics, which is where the maths prodigy Brin came in.In 1996 they began experimenting with the Stanford homepage and soon came up with the PageRank algorithm – a ranking system which would prove to be Page and Brin’s breakthrough idea.The algorithm was devised to give more weight to links that came from more authoritative pages – the more backlinks a site had, the more likely it was to be a good source, similar to an academic paper. That allowed Page and Brin to rank search results not only by keyword frequency but by authority. And because the system analysed links, the more the web grew the better Backrub got.In August 1996, Backrub became Google, a play on the term googol, meaning the large number 10 to the power of 100. The first version appeared on the Stanford site, run from cobbled-together bits of computers scavenged by Page and Brin. The system demanded so much bandwidth it would regularly take down the whole of Stanford’s internet connection, but it succeeded in letting users search all 24m pages it had stored in its database.On 15 September 1997 Google was registered and by August 1998 the first Google Doodle appeared – a Burning Man figure that was intended to let everyone know that both Page and Brin were at the festival in the Nevada desert.Google also got its first funding in the form of a cheque for $100,000 written by Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, in August 1998 to “Google Inc”. The trouble was that Google Inc didn’t exist yet, so after a rush to get the paperwork lined up Google was incorporated on 4 September 1998 so the pair could bank the cheque. Later that month the duo moved out of their dorm rooms and into the garage of friend Susan Wojcicki (now CEO of YouTube) in Menlo Park, California, complete with ping-pong table and bright blue carpet, receiving further investment from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, among others.Early in 1999, Page and Brin attempted to sell Google to Excite, then number two search engine behind Yahoo, for $1m, but even after the pair had been talked down to $750,000 by Excite venture capitalist Vinod Khosla, Excite CEO George Bell rejected them - although why he did remained a matter of debate  for years. Page and Brin had also reportedly attempted to sell their technology to then search engine Altavista and Yahoo in 1998 to no avail.With no buyer in sight, Google started hiring engineers and moved out of the garage to an office in Palo Alto in March 1999. In 2001, seeking so-called “adult supervision” for the company, Eric Schmidt was hired first as chairman and then CEO, taking over from Page. Schmidt was hired over some 50 other candidates because he had been to Burning Man, but he was tasked with the traditional corporate side of the business, leaving Page and Brin to continue to develop Google’s products and technologies respectively.By the end of its first decade, Google had effectively won the search-engine wars. PageRank had provided it its first major leg-up, letting it offer a better search experience than any of its competitors. To this day, the Google homepage remains clean and sparse, offering nothing more than a logo, search field, and two buttons.But the pivot that saw Google go from dominating a service to dominating an industry occurred when the company realised it needed to go outside its areas of expertise, and began an acquisition spree that would seed its evolution to the global behemoth it is today.Arguably, its most important purchase was YouTube, bought for $1.65bn in stock, then the largest purchase the company had made. Unlike many of Google’s previous acquisitions, where the company bought in technology it couldn’t make itself and threw its corporate weight behind making the resulting product success, YouTube was already a phenomenon, and Google had spent its own resources building a direct competitor, Google Video.But YouTube’s lead was already becoming difficult to compete with. Google was able to build a Flash-based video player in-house, but without the huge array of videos that were already on YouTube, it had no viewers, and with no viewers, there was no reason for anyone else to upload video – a vicious cycle. So Google made a still rare move, and bought, not technology, but users. The purchase price was eye-watering for the time, with the New York Times reporting that it sounded “like a tale from the dotcom bubble”, but the story also contained a more telling quote from Steve Ballmer – then Microsoft’s chief executive. “If you believe it’s the future of television, it’s clearly worth $1.6bn,” Ballmer said. The bet paid off. YouTube’s ad revenue alone was projected to be $4bn this year.What will be the next YouTube in Google’s portfolio? The company seems to think it will come from the world of AI. In 2014, Google bought AI company DeepMind for a reported $500m, augmenting its own AI efforts which had been bundled together into the Google Brain unit. DeepMind has continued to operate largely independently as a research-focused institute, most famous for its AlphaGo AI, which became the first machine to beat a professional player of the ancient Asian boardgame Go in 2016.Regulation, censorship and competition all threaten Google’s crown. The company’s first brush with governmental pressure came when the Chinese government’s internet filters started intermittently blocking Google in the year 2000. In 2006 the company decided to officially launch Google.cn, a decision which drew widespread criticism, since with a Chinese website came Chinese web censorship – something that Brin, who was born in the Soviet Union, was vocally uneasy with acceding to. Nonetheless, the censorship lasted until 2010, when Gmail became the target of a cyber-attack that the firm believed was attempting to gather information on Chinese human rights activists.It was recently revealed that the company is running a project, Dragonfly, aimed at producing a newly censored version of its search and news products, ready for a re-entry to China. But it’s not just repressive regimes that have forced Google to toe the line. In Europe and the US, the company has also had to give ground to legislatures, regulators and the judiciary.One of the company’s first areas of conflict was over copyright. Less than three months after Google bought YouTube, it was hit with a lawsuit from US media conglomerate Viacom for copyright infringement, a battle that would rage for seven years. Viacom had a strong case, noting that more than 150,000 clips of its copyrighted shows were available on the video-sharing site.But Viacom’s argument was slightly undercut by the revelation that it had uploaded much of the material itself. “For years, Viacom continuously and secretly uploaded its content to YouTube, even while publicly complaining about its presence there,” YouTube’s chief counsel wrote in 2010. The case was finally settled in March 2014. No money changed hands.Another copyright conflict had potentially larger ramifications. Agence France-Press sued Google in March 2005 for $17.5m for allegedly using its photos and stories on Google News without permission, leading to an arrangement to host various news agency content starting in 2007. That suit was followed by one from the Belgian newspaper group Copiepresse, and complaints from the French and German journalism bodies as well. The rows over Google News have continued, in some form or another, for the past decade, and Google has been forced into many concessions: paying licensing fees in some countries, settling out of court in others, and creating charitable funds to support journalism elsewhere.But while it lost some battles, it won the war, for the simple fact that Google News became too big for publishers to ignore. When, in Germany, Google offered the ability for publishers to remove their content from the search engine, Axel Springer, one of the country’s largest publishing companies, took the chance. It told Google the company would have to pay or cease to run images and snippets of text from Axel publications. Google chose the latter option, and, Axel said, traffic plunged. It bowed out of the fight after just two weeks.The size of Google is undoubtedly a strength in fights like that, but it opens another avenue of attack for regulators: it is, in some areas, a monopoly. That means it has to be very careful about how it wields its power, or it will fall prey to competition regulators. In Europe, that process has already begun, with the commission finding that Google had abused its monopolies in search engines and mobile phone app stores. The company has been fined €6.7bn for those two breaches.Facebook has a more fundamental line of attack: it wants to kill the web. A Facebook future is one in which a significant proportion of humanity’s data sits, not on the open web, but on the closed social network. That would cut Google off from the information it can search, index and make available, forcing it into ever more extractive relationships with its own users as data sources instead.Of course, the threats could come from a company which doesn’t even exist yet. Maybe one that’s being founded today, and in 20 years time will be ready to take on Google, just like Google has taken on the legacy stars of its own industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/891f04ade129ab84254689df10b3258573d7b736/1242_1010_3202_1921/master/3202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9eb76c2d018ce2edb9a19b3fe05b3ab","title":"historic autumn uk walks scotland hampshire yorkshire devon glasgow","story":"Fascinating stories lie at the heart of these autumnal walks. From exploring dark history on the moors to Roman Britain, nature writers follow in fabled footsteps• See part 2 tomorrowLengthtime 2¼ miles, 1-2 hours Startfinish Upper Birks car parkRefuel Aberfeldy Watermill or Birks CinemaIn August 1803, Dorothy Wordsworth left Cumbria with her better-known brother (and, initially, the poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge) in a “jaunting car” (two-wheeled carriage) pulled by a “stout horse” for a six-week tour of Scotland.As a single woman and travel-writing pioneer, she found the Highlands mysterious and foreign-feeling, unsettled in the aftermath of the battle of Culloden and in the midst of the Clearances. Her sharply observed travelogue, Recollections of a Tour Made in Scotland, shows her both close to nature and to the women who cooked for them, offering a unique insight into the social conditions of the time.Commenting on food (she ate heartily of a boiled sheep’s head with the hair singed off), the quality of homes and inns, meetings with foot travellers and numerous cattle droves, she also classified the roads: from Portnacroish to Ballachulish, tolerable from Blair Atholl to Faskally, wretchedly bad.Often walking, out of necessity or for pleasure, they arrived in Aberfeldy from Loch Tay to the west, taking a woodman’s track through a narrow glen and climbing steeply to the Falls of Moness. This is now a circular walk known as the Birks (birches in Scots) after The Birks o’Aberfeldie song lyric written by Robert Burns in 1787.Following in Dorothy’s footsteps is particularly rewarding in autumn, when the well-laid path tunnels through a grand hall of coppery beech, climbing the rocky cleft through birch and rowan canopies pierced by needles of sunlight. White-water thrums alongside walkers of all ages and dispositions, stilling occasionally into peat-gold pools.Lichen, moss, fern and fairytale fungi all thrive in this humidity, creating a botanist’s paradise. Views open out as the thundering waterfall is crossed on a high bridge, before the path descends the other side of the gorge.This short walk can be extended a further seven miles to Kenmore on the Rob Roy Way. To walk in the spirit of Dorothy, sharpen your senses, be curious about your fellow walkers, and take a few notes. You might even offer them to your brother as the basis for a poem!Linda Cracknell, author of Doubling Back: Ten Paths Trodden in Memory (Freight Books, £14.99)So much of Britain is shaped by those sandal-clad invaders who turned up in 43AD. In their first hundred years here, the Romans constructed more than 10,000 miles of roads and built forts, temples and towns. Place names with “cester” and “chester” are giveaways for towns with Roman origins but the archaeology is often hard to spot. Silchester is different.The town was founded by the Atrebates tribe in the first century BC, who called it Calleva and made it their tribal capital. When the Romans arrived, they built their own town on the same site, calling it Calleva Atrebatum – Calleva of the Atrebates. The town continued to flourish, even after the Romans left, in AD410, but then it was abandoned and never rebuilt.The small, modern village of Silchester sits a mile up the road but it’s nothing compared to the regional majesty this place once boasted. Despite more than 18 years of cutting-edge archaeological excavations, it remains unclear why Calleva Atrebatum was forsaken. However, the Saxons’ loss is a modern adventurer’s gain: the preservation of the 2,000-year-old remains is outstanding.This walk treads the full circuit of walls, taking in the original north and south town gates and the amphitheatre – one of the best preserved in the country.Start at the Roman Town car park and follow the footpath near the information boards, keeping the trees and earthworks to the left. Turn left and left again on the track, then follow the walls and earthworks in a clockwise circuit. After the north gate you’ll meet a quiet road – turn left and find the amphitheatre. It was built outside the town walls around AD70.Retrace your steps along the road and explore the 12th-century St Mary’s church, where you’ll spot distinctive terracotta Roman tiles reused in the walls. Then keep heading clockwise to complete the circle. On an autumn day this place feels serene. But for around 500 years it was a site of power and politics, a melting pot of cultures and a strategic stronghold. A place of many stories.Mary-Ann Ochota, author of Hidden Histories: A Spotter’s Guide to the British LandscapeFollow a path to the rear of the house towards Glendun Lodge, once home to Ada McNeill, Lord Cushendun’s first cousin, a firm Republican and friend of Roger Casement (executed for treason in the Easter Rising in 1916). The path ends on Glendun Road. Turn right past the old gate lodge of Glenmona House – on the left a new dwelling sits on the corner between the Glendun and Torr Roads – once the site Cushendun House, destroyed in a fire in 1928. The story goes that on the morning after the blaze, a housemaid took a photo of the still-smoking ruins on a box brownie. In reproductions, you can clearly see a figure by the doorway. When Ada McNeill saw the photograph, she identified the figure as her grandfather, Edmund Alexander McNeill, who had died in the house in 1879.With the sea to your right, follow Torr Road, keeping an eye out for bronze-age standing stones, and turn right to the sea opposite Beachview Cottages, passing the ruins of Carra Castle, site of the death of Shane O’Neill and his kinsmen in 1567. On the left is the late-Georgian Rockport Lodge (now privately owned), former family home to writer Moira O’Neill, author of Songs of the Glens of Antrim, and mother to novelist Molly Keane.Turn right along the beach, or take one of the wooden walkways across the grasslands at the Warren. Cross the bridge over the River Dun, turn left past a sculpture, of Johann the goat, and follow the road past an apartment block, turning sharp right towards the caves.The Cave House dates to 1832 and is accessed via red sandstone caves, just high and wide enough for a small car. The house is behind locked gates but is popular with Game of Thrones fans, since a number of scenes were filmed here. Walk back to Glenmona through the Cushendun conservation village. Lord Cushendun’s wife, Maud, was born in Penzance and the village square and cottages (now owned by the National Trust) were designed by Williams-Ellis between 1912 and 1926 in an Arts and Crafts-style to resemble a Cornish village.Bernie McGill , author of The Watch House (Tinder Press, £8.99), set on Rathlin Island at the time of the Marconi wireless experimentsIn the first few hours of Christmas Day 1839, William Critchard staggered home through a landscape of orchards, grazing animals and market gardens. He’d drunk a lot of ale at the ritual “burning of the faggot”, and when he got back he failed to notice the huge crack in the wall of his house. But even he couldn’t sleep through the noise that occurred at 4am, and woke to find his house and garden were moving. He escaped but by the end of Christmas Day, the “Great Slip” had taken 8 million tonnes of rock and earth, including William’s cottage and the land surrounding it, in a landslide towards the sea.The tumble of chalk and earth left behind is now a national nature reserve. Undisturbed, the flora has naturalised into a rare British jungle. Following the South West Coast Path east from Seaton it enters The Undercliff, a dripping green time warp into a land that feels ancient. Trees and climbers twist and grow in unrestricted movement, ferns and mosses carpet the ground and curtains of ivy fall and bar the way.The path is the only way in or out but Ravine Pool at halfway makes a perfect place to stop for a picnic and soak up the atmosphere. Although it can be wet and slippery underfoot, it’s a remarkable path to walk in the early autumn, as the trees change colour, the rain drips gently through the ivy and you’re transported to another world. It’s hard to adjust to the light as you leave The Undercliff at Lyme Regis, but you’re in the perfect place to continue your walk through time with a spot of fossil hunting on the Jurassic Coast.Raynor Winn, author of The Salt Path, the story of a couple’s 630-mile journey around the South West Coast Path (Michael Joseph, £14.99)Cragg Vale is a wooded valley leading up to the moors that inspired local lad Ted Hughes. It has a turbulent history: in the early 1800s it hosted many wool mills notorious for child labour, and more recently the local church warden was one Jimmy Savile.It was also home to the Cragg Vale Coiners, a murderous gang who used the erse landscape to pull off Britain’s largest forgery operation and whose leader, “King” David Hartley, was hanged in York in 1770. It is in their clog-wearing footsteps that this route follows, taking in beautiful woodlands, moors and ancient tracks.Starting from the Dusty Miller pub, cross the River Calder, pass the Shoulder of Mutton and follow Cragg Road for half a mile or so. A right turn at Dauber Bridge leads into nature reserve Broadhead Clough, once known as Bell Hole. At any time of year, these managed woods are beautiful.Follow the steep path into a world shorn of trees, where the wind whistles through the heather of Erringden Moor. To your left is the solitary Bell House, Hartley’s former home. Head towards it and be thankful for the new stretch of boardwalk that crosses a treacherous bog.The flat gritstone of the Lumb Stone is the marker for a descent past Lower Lumb Lodge and through woods to emerge at the industrial ruins of Papermill Cottage. On the main road above is the cosy Robin Hood Inn (food served weekends only). Turn right off Cragg Road, north of the pub, into Sutcliffe Wood, at the top of which sit the impressive Robin Hood Rocks, including the overhanging stone called Long Tom, after a Boer war cannon.From here look across the dense canopy to Coiners country. Heading through Hollin Hey Wood, cross the open hillside of Coneygarth, site of medieval rabbit-breeding warrens. The ancient packhorse track of Stake Lane leads to Hall Bank Lane, back into Mytholmroyd.Ben Myers, author of The Gallows Pole (Bluemoose, £9.99) – a novel about the Cragg Vale Coiners, and winner of the Walter Scott Prize 2018 – and Under The Rock (Elliott \u0026amp Thompson, £14.99)The best way to get to know Glasgow is to walk within it. The best way to walk within it is to go from graveyard to graveyard, a daunderamong the dead. Start at Cathcart cemetery. Here is a sorrowful mystery: “Mark Sheridan, comedian” it says on the stone, giving his date of death, at 52, as 15 January 1918. Sheridan was an English music hall star. That we all know I Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside is because of the popularity of his recording. He shot himself in Kelvingrove Park while on tour, and was buried far from the side of the silvery sea.Go north, through Govanhill, Glasgow’s Ellis Island, historically the first place immigrants settle – the latest wave of which are hipsters. Sustain yourself with a veggie samosa from Delicious Corner Bakers (232 Allison Street) – the best in town, and just 75p.Carry on up Cathcart Road to the United Presbyterian Church. Even derelict, this is one of the city’s great buildings, its weaponised melancholy the essence of Glaswegianism. Pay homage to its architect, Alexander “Greek” Thomson, at his grave in the Southern Necropolis, on nearby Caledonia Road. This atmospheric Victorian cemetery was the scene, in 1954, of a bizarre moment of hysteria when gangs of children, armed with stakes, hunted for the “Gorbals Vampire” – a creature rumoured to have iron teeth and a thirst for the blood of boys.Raise a glass to Alexander Thomson in the Laurieston on Bridge Street, a pub unchanged since the 1960s. This is a fine place to contemplate one’s life and others’ death, thanks to the landlord’s practice of clipping obituaries and tacking them to the walls.Refreshed, continue through the town centre to the Necropolis. Beautiful and grand, this hilltop cemetery has, at its peak, a statue of the Protestant reformer John Knox, glowering sternly southwards, back the way you have walked. Knox would not, one suspects, enjoy Findlay Napier’s song Young Goths In The Necropolis – but it is a touching tribute to the place and the youth tribes who wander here, in the “city of the dead”.Peter Ross, author of The Passion of Harry Bingo (Sandstone, £7.10)Looking for a holiday with a difference?

What does its removal say about history and public art?In the middle of the night and with dozens of Native Americans watching, San Francisco city workers tied safety ropes around a 124-year-old bronze statue and pulled. Carefully, they dislodged the piece from a granite platform and laid it on top of a flatbed truck. It was a moment stoked with meaning. After decades of effort, the Early Days statue, a symbol of colonization and oppression to many, was gone.Those who gathered at the removal last week didn’t celebrate with fire torches. They only prayed, sang hymns, and looked on morosely at the empty platform. That’s what happens when civic institutions, in this case the city arts commissions, finally see a people as worthy of protection.Erected in the aftermath of the California mission era, the Early Days statue depicts a Native American on his back, defeated, a Catholic priest above him pointing to the heavens, and an anglicized vaquero bestriding the scene in triumph. The statue is part of the Pioneer Monument celebrating the state’s origins. Native Americans saw it as dehumanizing art but no one had managed to convince politicians to take it down. It wasn’t until gender- and racially-erse city boards, as well as backlash against Eurocentric depictions of dominance, that change came.Over the last few months, I spoke with Native Americans who said the existence of this type of art in a public sphere kept alive false narratives. That native people’s systematic killing was a necessary means to an end of the state’s development and current prosperity. It’s the type of thinking that becomes gospel if only one side tells you what to believe in.The journey to the statue’s current undisclosed location – where officials say it’s safely preserved – has been long and winding.In 1996, a plaque was added to Early Days to explain what happened to natives but political pressure resulted in language that reeked of false objectivity. Catholic leaders rejected copy fully blaming missionaries for Native deaths, using disease and malnutrition as top factors rather than mistreatment and murder.Last year, concern grew over Early Days in the aftermath of the deadly riots in Charlottesville, Virginia, incited by the removal of a statue of confederate General Robert E Lee. On 2 October 2017, after the public asked leaders to remove the statue, the arts commission passed a resolution to initiate a review. At a following meeting, it voted to put it in storage.But there was pushback. Frear Stephen Schmid, a Sonoma county lawyer, said the commission didn’t have the legal right to remove it. Broadly, he said art shouldn’t be changed and the statue merited historical preservation, which the board of appeals agreed with. People really got upset.Asking for a rehearing, city directors noted a similar appeal to cultural understanding had been approved – the city administrative code had changed Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day. Continued display, they said, “causes real and sustained harm to San Francisco’s Native American community” especially when old visual stereotypes are “now universally viewed as disrespectful, misleading, and racist”. This led to the new, final vote to remove last week. As for Schimd, he said he’s going to sue the city.As the fight against white supremacist symbols grows in America under a president that supports them all but explicitly, citizens are ramping up more tear downs. San Jose removed a statue of Christopher Columbus and Arcata’s William McKinley statue’s days are numbered (he broke up tribal governments). More than 30 other cities are either in discussion to or recently removed statues including southern hubs such as Atlanta, Birmingham and Nashville.Native people like Harp say part of the problem with statues is not just that they’re disrespectful and emotionally triggering but that they’re factually inaccurate. The Native American depicted in Early Days, for example, was from the Plains but native people of the Bay Area were Ohlone.There’s also not enough educational support to help people contextualize complicated history. Sara Chase, a UC Berkeley educator, says California school curriculums fail to provide accurate perspectives of Native Americans or other minorities. Asian, Latino and black colleagues of mine remember school-grade projects about the missions without learning of Native genocide.And sometimes, poor education about minorities is by design. In Arizona, ethnic studies curriculums are banned and because of the 2001 No Child Left Behind law, many schools were forced to focus on standardized tests as opposed to culturally-accurate history.So if the statue doesn’t provide an accurate idea of history, is it valid as a piece of public art? Jeff Hou, a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Washington, says no. He says the public realm is accountable to one audience – the public.“In the public realm, works of arts and design are subject to the public process. In other words, the public can have a say in what’s appropriate in a public space in a democracy,” he told me.For the public to decide what’s appropriate art, Hou says, systems in power shouldn’t be weighted to a “limited category of iniduals, such as members of particular gender, class and race”. In San Francisco, this means commissions should embody societal changes. “As society changes,” he says, “it’s natural those whom are historically marginalized must gain a stronger voice”.And art seeking to express history doesn’t need to stay the same. History is always revisited based on new discoveries and affects how it’s interpreted. In Yale professor Dolores Hayden’s The Power of Place, the role women and minorities had in creating Los Angeles were reclaimed through ethnic public street murals.In creating a new open space in front of City Hall, the commissions may have provided a new space and place for a similar reclamation. That is, if the next lawsuit doesn’t stop them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6805b4d478b9e76d169711e4ce5dc5c3800c8336/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5688146bfb8acd1c925e5fae43c8113f","title":"indonesian teenager survives 49 days adrift at sea in fishing hut","story":"Aldi Novel Adilang, 19, was working alone in a ‘rompong’ when heavy winds snapped its moorings An Indonesian teenager has survived 49 days adrift at sea in a fishing hut, before he was rescued by a Panamanian-flagged vessel and returned home.Aldi Novel Adilang, a 19-year-old from Sulawesi, worked as a lamp keeper on a floating fish trap, known locally as rompong, located 125km out at sea.The teenager was employed to light the rompong’s lamps, designed to attract the fish, and according to his father had done the job since he was sixteen.Each week someone from his company would come to harvest the fish from the traps and deliver him fresh supplies of food, water and fuel.The small, floating wooden hut – one of 50 owned by the company and spread across the waters of Manado – was anchored to the seabed by a long rope and suspended by bouys.But in mid-July heavy winds snapped its moorings and sent Aldi adrift into the ocean.The teenager only had a few days worth of supplies and survived by catching fish, burning wood from his hut to cook them, and sipping seawater through his clothes to minimize his salt intake.The Indonesian consulate in Osaka said that 10 ships had sailed past the Indonesian teenager before a Panamanian-flagged vessel, MV Arpeggio, finally picked him up in the waters off Guam on 31 August – more than a month and a half later.“Every time he saw a large ship, he said, he was hopeful, but more than 10 ships had sailed past him, none of them stopped or saw Aldi,” Fajar Firdaus, an Indonesian diplomat from the consulate in Osaka, told the Jakarta Post.Aldi initially waved a cloth at MV Arpeggio but after failing to attract the attention of its crew, sent an emergency radio signal.Interviewed by local news portal TribunManado, Aldi said he thought he “was going to die out there”. At one point he said was suicidal and considered jumping into the ocean, but remembered his parents’ advice to pray in times of distress. He had a bible on board so he did.After rescuing him the captain contacted the Guam coast guard, and as the ship was headed to Japan, it was decided the teenager would be handed over to consulate officials on arrival in Tokuyama on 6 September.Stranded in the middle of the ocean without supplies and unsure of his fate, “Aldi was scared and cried often” during the experience, said Firdaus.The teenager flew home to Manado on 8 September, accompanied by consulate officials, and is reportedly in good health."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/553cbd92c5eb3baf0d8401b9f3763b967e323b84/0_132_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc559b0262548cbf58397a7ec8ca5207","title":"new us tariffs on china take effect with no compromise in sight","story":"Washington imposes $200bn taxes on Chinese goods, while Beijing targets $60bn of US goodsThe United States and China have imposed new tit-for-tat tariffs against each other’s goods, the latest escalation in a heated trade war between the world’s two largest economies.US tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory tariffs by Beijing on $60bn worth of US products took effect at 0400 GMT. The two countries already exchanged tariffs on $50bn worth of each other’s goods earlier this year.Soon after the tariffs went into effect, China issued a 36,000-word white paper accusing the US of “economic hegemony” that threatens the global multilateral trading system as well as Sino-US ties, according to Xinhua.Even while running for president, Donald Trump waged a war of words against China, promising punitive import tariffs to “bring back” jobs to America.The president believes slapping import tariffs on Chinese goods will raise their price versus American equivalents, giving US companies the edge when selling products to domestic consumers.The hope is businesses will hire more workers, as domestic manufacturing becomes more competitive against foreign competition. The danger is import tariffs drive up the price of goods for consumers and trigger an economic slowdown.US Census Bureau figures show that US imports from China exceeded exports going the other way by $376bn last year. Many economists would not worry about this risk of reliance on foreign imports, though Trump views the imbalance as payments made to Chinese manufacturers without adequate reciprocation, and has pledged to reduce the trade deficit.Washington complains China uses “unfair” trading practices, including the theft of US firms’ intellectual property. Many other nations, including EU countries, make similar complaints, yet Trump appears to be going it alone without international cooperation.Some observers argue the president is using the threat of tariffs to force China into negotiations, and that a deal can be done. Others warn Beijing will not back down.Though a senior White House official last week said the United States would continue to engage China for a “positive way forward,” neither side has signalled a willingness to compromise.The US official said on Friday there was no date set for the next round of talks. The Wall Street Journal reported China has cancelled upcoming trade discussions with the United States and will not send vice-premier Liu He to Washington this week.Economists have warned that a protracted dispute will eventually stunt growth not just in the US and China but across the broader global economy. Worries about the confrontation have already rattled financial markets.Chinese products hit with new duties include a range of consumer goods from vacuum cleaners and seafood to internet-connected devices. Previous tariffs targeted industrial goods and components. US goods targeted by Beijing include liquefied natural gas and certain types of aircraft.The trade tensions have cast a pall over broader relations between Beijing and Washington, with the two sides butting heads on a growing number of issues.On Saturday, China summoned the US ambassador in Beijing and postponed joint military talks in protest against a US decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system. China also recalled its naval chief from the US.US lawmakers have called on their government to sanction Chinese officials involved in a counter-terrorism campaign in the western Chinese territory of Xinjiang, which rights activists say has led to widespread human rights abuses of Muslim minorities.Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, said in a note to clients that in the absence of any incentives Beijing would likely hold off on any further negotiations for now.“It would look weak both to the US and at home,” he said, adding that there is “sufficient stimulus in the pipeline” to limit the damage of the latest tariffs on China’s growth.“The US-China trade war has no clear end in sight.”President Donald Trump on Saturday reiterated a threat to impose further tariffs on Chinese goods should Beijing retaliate, in line with his previous comments signalling that Washington may move to impose tariffs on virtually all imported Chinese goods if the administration does not get its way.China imports far less from the United States, making a dollar-for-dollar match on any new US tariffs impossible.Instead, it has warned of “qualitative” measures to retaliate. Though Beijing has not revealed what such steps might be, business executives and analysts say China could withhold exports of certain products to the US or create more administrative red tape for American companies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3639500.1537786705!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dry weather on the way as high pressure system sets in","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDeers in the Phoenix Park in Dublin this Autumn.

Heavier clouds are forecasted for Thursday, with patches of rain expected over Connacht and Ulster travelling southward as the day continues. A cool and bright start to the weekend is currently expected, with temperatures dipping back down into low-to-mid teens on Friday. Similar weather is expected for Saturday and Sunday, with a chance of some passing showers. Clear skies will be welcomed in Co Offaly this week, as the 48th Irish Hot Air Ballooning Championships are set to take place at Birr Castle. Similar weather is expected across the United Kingdom, as the British Met Office expects “a fine day for many with sunny spells.” A chilly start to the week will be met with predominantly dry weather, and wind and rain is expected in the north of the UK as the week continues.

Laois County Council voted to nominate Ms O’Doherty after a meeting on Monday morning. Ms O’Doherty needs the nomination of a further three local authorities to secure a place on the ballot. Four councillors voted in favour of nominating Ms O’Doherty, and 11 abstained from the vote. However, her hopes of getting her presidential nomination suffered a significant blow when Cork County Council voted overwhelmingly not to nominate her.Five councillors voted in favour of her nomination, 28 voted against the motion, and six abstained.A motion to nominate Ms O’Doherty had been put forward by Independent Cllr Diarmaid Ó Cadhla, who said the result of the vote was “very disappointing.” Ms O’Doherty received votes from Cllr O’Cadhla, and fellow independents Cllr Kieran McCarthy, Cllr Ger Keohane and Cllr Alan Coleman as well as from Social Democrat Cllr Joe Harris.Two county councils meeting on Monday have not yet taken a decision on if they will nominate anyone as a candidate, Donegal and Kildare County Council.This means there is not enough uncommitted local authorities remaining to provide Ms O’Doherty with the required four nominations. In a post on Twitter following the nomination of Laois County Council Ms O’Doherty said she was “delighted” to receive her first nomination. “Thanks to all of the councillors who supported me. Laois has shown itself to be a democratic county,” she said.Candidates seeking to contest the presidential election next month must secure the backing of four local authorities, or 20 TDs and senators. The incumbent President Michael D Higgins can nominate himself to run for re-election. So far five other candidates have secured places on the ballot Dragons’ Den panellists Seán Gallagher, Peter Casey, Gavin Duffy, Independent Senator Joan Freeman, and Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada.Sligo County Council met at 9:30am, but motions to nominate Sean Gallagher and Peter Casey were withdrawn, as both men had already secured places on the ballot. Donegal County Council is meeting at 11am, but there is no motion listed to nominate any candidate to contest the election. Kildare County Council is holding a special meeting at 12:30pm to vote on the issue, with motions to nominate Ms O’Doherty and Mr Gallagher on the agenda.

I’m bound by the democracy of our party.” Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergBritain’s Labour party moved closer to calling for a second referendum on Brexit on Sunday when Jeremy Corbyn said he would accept the decision his party conference makes this week. Speaking at the start of the conference in Liverpool, where delegates will vote on a second referendum on Tuesday, the Labour leader said there would be a clear vote on the issue.“Let’s see what comes out of conference. I’m bound by the democracy of our party,” he said.A YouGov poll of Labour members published at the weekend found that 86 per cent wanted a referendum on the final Brexit deal, with only 8 per cent opposed to it. With strong support for a second vote among trade unionists and members of Momentum, the group established to support Mr Corbyn’s leadership, and among pro-European centrists, the Labour conference is expected to back it.Asked for a response to the Labour leader’s comments, a Government spokesman said its practice was not to comment on internal British political affairs.Fianna Fáil’s Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers described the prospect of Labour supporting a second referendum as a “significant development in the Brexit process”. She said it represented a big shift from Mr Corbyn to concede as much, especially as he was “not a supporter of the EU”. Sinn Féin’s Brexit spokesperson David Cullinane said his party’s priority was to ensure a backstop guaranteeing open borders in Ireland.Mr Corbyn said on Sunday that it would be “very hard” to accept customs checks in the Irish Sea, stating that the solution was to secure a trade and a customs arrangement with the EU. He said Labour would vote down any Brexit deal Theresa May brings back from Brussels if it does not satisfy the party’s demand that it should have all the benefits of remaining in the single market and the customs union.“We would vote it down if it didn’t meet out tests, in order to send the government – if it is still in office – straight back to the negotiating table,” he told the BBC.The British prime minister will chair cabinet on Monday for the first time since last week’s Salzburg summit, when European Council president Donald Tusk and French president Emmanuel Macron dismissed the economic proposals in her Chequers plan as unacceptable.Ms May is under pressure from Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers to abandon Chequers and former cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and David Davis will on Monday endorse a proposal for a Canada-style free trade agreement. Brexit secretary Dominic Raab on Sunday insisted that the government would not change course but he called for more flexibility from EU negotiators.“If we just get this sort of ‘computer says no’ response from the EU we are not going to make progress,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Boris Johnson and David Davis, who resigned from the cabinet in protest against Chequers, will on Monday endorse a proposal for a Canada-style free trade agreement instead.Writing in the Mail on Sunday, Jacob Rees-Mogg said the EU leaders’ treatment of Mrs May served as a reminder of why Britain voted to leave.“The EU is blind to have turned down the Chequers proposal – it offers Europe almost all it wants, but in its greed it asks for more. As proposed it would leave the UK a vassal state, chained to rules it could not alter and denied the liberty it voted for. That, in its overbearing arrogance, the EU has rejected this has saved the United Kingdom from a bad deal,” he wrote.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab dismissed reports that the prime minister was considering a snap election as “for the birds” and insisted the government is sticking with the Chequers proposals despite Salzburg.“We have come up with a serious set of proposals. We are not just going to flit from plan to plan like some sort of diplomatic butterfly. We are going to be resolute about this and really press the EU to treat us with some respect,” he said.Mr Raab said that Britain would hold its nerve and continue to negotiate “in good faith” but he said the EU would have to show more flexibility if a deal is to be agreed.“If we just get this sort of ‘computer says no’ response from the EU we are not going to make progress,” he said.Meanwhile, at the Labour Party conference party officials are working on a Brexit compromise after more than 100 local organisations submitted motions on the EU exit to Labour’s annual gathering, said deputy leader Tom Watson.Many called for a referendum on a orce deal reached with Brussels while others demanded another vote on the basic question of staying in or leaving the bloc.On a day when 5,000 people marched through Liverpool to call for Labour to back a second referendum, general secretary of Unite Len McCluskey added his voice to warnings about holding a second vote. He said a ballot should be on the deal, not EU membership. Some Labour voters have threatened to switch their support to ensure Brexit goes through, he added.“There are significant numbers of traditional Labour supporters who are saying we’re going to vote Conservative because we don’t trust Labour to take us out of the European Union,” Mr McCluskey told BBC Radio 5 Live. “We’re coming out of the European Union, for us to now enter some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again I think would be wrong.”Mr McCluskey’s remarks come on the back of a YouGov poll that indicated more than 86 per cent of Labour members want a second vote. Delegates will debate the issue on Tuesday. – Additional reporting BloombergDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Alex WongGetty Images The Capitol is covered in mud.Somewhere in the dim recesses of my mind, I can recall a time when the sight of that white dome thrilled me. As a teenager, working for a New York congressman, I felt privileged to walk the same marble corridors where some of America’s most revered leaders had walked.I can also vaguely remember a time, back before the travesty of Bush v Gore, when I felt awe walking past the Supreme Court. And if I try really hard, I can summon the lost sensation of pride in covering the White House. But all that is utterly changed.It was wrenching to watch the futile Iraq war unfold, with its tragic echoes of Vietnam. It is jarring to think I could live through three sagas of impeachment. But I most dread the rhyming history we are plunged into now: the merciless pummelling of a woman who dares to obstruct the glide path of a conservative Supreme Court nominee.It is unnerving to think how far women have come, only to find ourselves dragged back to the same place.It has been almost exactly 27 years since the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings, and we are still defensively explaining – including to the US’s troglodyte president – why women do not always tell the authorities about verbal and physical sexual assaults, why they bury episodes or try to manoeuvre past them.We are still watching a bookish university professor from the west, who tried to anonymously report an alleged blight on the character of a man about to ascend to a lifetime of power, get smeared as a demanding, mixed-up, uptight, loony fantasist.I didn’t sleep the week of the Hill-Thomas hearings. At first I was feverishly trying to figure out what was true in their two diametrically opposite stories.But it quickly became apparent that Thomas was lying.His friends and supporters had talked publicly about how, at Yale Law School, Thomas was a regular patron of X-rated movie houses and enjoyed describing the porn to friends afterward.But that was not introduced into testimony by either the Republicans or the Democrats. Instead, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch – who is still on the judiciary committee at age 84 for this new kangaroo court – suggested that a man as esteemed as Thomas could not possibly know the language of porn, that anyone who talked like that was “a psychopathic sex fiend or a pervert”.Hatch preposterously accused Hill of scavenging her testimony about Long Dong Silver from an old law case, and her story about Thomas asking “Who put pubic hair on my Coke?” from the novel The Exorcist.No one was trying to figure out the truth or do what was best for the court and the country. Republicans only cared about ramming through a right-wing justice. Even though they were the majority, Democrats were cowed by Thomas wrapping himself in the charged symbolism of the civil rights movement he had always scorned. And they were gun-shy after criticism of their initial bungling of Hill’s revelation. (Does that ring a bell?) Joe Biden, the committee chairman, cancelled the testimony of Hill’s backup witnesses from work.Teddy Kennedy was mute, hobbled by his own past sins. The feminists were less concerned with Hill’s humiliation than with using her as a bludgeon to block a justice who would be devastating on women’s rights.After a three-day FBI investigation, the White House declared Hill’s charges “unfounded”. Then agents were pressured by Republicans into providing affidavits suggesting that Hill had embellished her testimony, as Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson wrote in Strange Justice.Anita Hill was alone, in a hearing room full of Republican liars and Democratic cowards, getting ripped apart as “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty,” in the immortal words of Kavanaugh pal turned Hillary henchman David Brock and this in front of her elderly parents, farmers from Oklahoma.Post #MeToo, the Republicans know they have to be more careful on the surface. Their wet work to discredit Christine Blasey Ford will have to be outsourced and done mostly outside the hearing room consider the sordid, outrageous attempt by Ed Whelan – a friend of Brett Kavanaugh’s who heads a prominent conservative think tank on, ahem, ethics – to throw suspicion on a lookalike classmate at Georgetown Prep. Backed by the Swift Boat public relations slimers, as Politico reported, Whelan even tweeted a floor plan to the house the student grew up in.Dr Blasey is dealing with some demonic forces not in play with Prof Hill: a vicious partisan internet that drove her out of her house and being discredited not merely by the White House but personally by a president who has bragged on tape about his history of sexual assault, who has consistently defended predators such as Roger Ailes, Bill O’Reilly and Roy Moore, and who is advised by the same man who enabled Ailes’s loathsome behaviour at Fox News.We haven’t forgotten our history. But we still seem doomed to repeat it. – New York Times"},{"url":null,"title":"vladimir putin russias action man president in pictures","story":"Vladimir Putin\u0027s Kremlin press office has cultivated a swashbuckling image over the many years he has been in power.

Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Olivia was the most popular name for baby girls in each of the nine English regions in 2017 as well as in Wales, with Amelia the second favourite everywhere except the South West of England where Isla was in second.Although Oliver did rank top nationally, unlike Olivia, it was not universally popular. Muhammad was the top boys\u0027 name in London, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands while Harry was top in the North East for boys for the second year running.There was relatively little movement in the top 10 spots for both boys and girls. Lily replaced Poppy in the top 10 girls’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2015. Leo replaced Thomas in the top 10 for boys’ names for England and Wales in 2017, compared with 2016.The statistics, compiled by the ONS, are derived from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations.

Brand new entries into the top 100 for girls include the names Aurora and HallieThere were only two new entries into the top 100 most popular boys’ names in 2017 for England and Wales: Hunter and Ralph replaced Aaron and Jasper, which were in the top 100 in 2016.There were six new entries in the top 100 most popular girls’ names in 2017 in England and Wales: Aurora, Orla, Edith, Bonnie, Lyla and Hallie replaced Lexi, Zoe, Maddison, Sarah, Felicity and Lydia.The influence of popular culture continues to seemingly provide inspiration for new parents.

Every time he saw a large ship, he said he was hopeful, but more than ten ships had passed him, none of them stopped,” said Fajar Firdaus, a diplomat. Mr Aldi’s ordeal finally ended on August 31 Mirza Nurhidayat, the Indonesian consul general in Osaka, explained that Mr Aldi’s hut, known as a Rompong, did not have a paddle or an engine.  After his meagre food supplies ran out, he had to catch fish and drink sea water to survive.“After he ran out of cooking gas, he burned the rompong’s wooden fences to make fire for cooking. He drank by sipping water from his clothes,” he said. Mr Aldi’s ordeal finally ended on August 31 when he saw the tanker ‘Arpeggio’ sailing nearby. After failing to attract attention by waving a cloth, he switched his radio to an emergency frequency and the ship’s captain picked it up. The rescue was complicated by high waves and crew members threw a rope to help him as the ship circled his tiny craft.

And if so when?I am 39 years old and I’ve just been made Health Secretary. That’s quite enough for the moment,” says Mr Hancock, smiling.He doesn’t deny that he is keenly competitive, if occasionally hapless. Previous exploits include an attempt to play the most northerly game of cricket - on the North Pole. This was foiled on two counts it turned out not to be the first, and rather more seriously, he ended up with frostbite on four fingers.But Mr Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne, is a survivor. While other allies of Cameron and Osborne have seen their careers fade, Mr Hancock - a Remainer - and junior minister since 2013 - was promoted from digital minister to Culture Secretary at the start of this year, becoming Health Secretary in the reshuffle in July.Already, he has shown he is not afraid to ruffle feathers. Matt Hancock at the start of his visit to China Earlier this month, he revealed his ambition for a digital revolution in health, with every patient offered smartphone consultations by their GP.He also signalled his frustrations at NHS efforts to block the moves, within hours meeting the head of NHS England for talks about reforming the current system to allow the spread of such systems.A passionate advocate of tech, Mr Hancock is not afraid of sounding geeky. Now he is co-hosting WEF’s annual meeting of champions - the “summer Davos” - after flying to China with 12 British technology and healthcare firms.Among the discussions how best the world should face the challenges of its ageing population, and the role of technology in meeting those needs.But the minister suggests that a major shift in attitudes - and a greater emphasis on social responsibility is at least as important.Later this year, the Government will publish a green paper on social care, tackling the vexed question of how to fund care of the elderly.Mr Hancock today signals his interest in a new model of funding, based on that of pensions - where it is assumed that workers will pay in to the system, unless they actively opt out.Such measures would not be without controversy.However, they might avoid some of the heat around previous proposals.Last year Theresa May\u0027s pledge to extend charges on assets to cover home care was cast aside after being dubbed a “dementia tax”.It was also blamed for the Tories\u0027 poor electoral performance.The Health and Social Care Secretary suggests the Government needs to learn from pensions, where a political consensus was built, before the “auto-enrolment” system was brought in.One of the problems with social care- funding for places in care homes, as well as care in the home - is that many people assume the state will pay for it, only to be shocked when informed otherwise, he suggests.A national care fund, based on the “opt-out” principle could work one of two ways, he suggests.A system of full insurance would mean iniduals would have their care costs covered, if they needed help at home, or ended up in a care home. However, this could mean relatively steep payments, given that average cost of care is around £25,000. An alternative model might mean insurance payments during employment could mean a cap on later care costs.Either could avoid the situation of catastrophic care costs, with one in 10 pensioners facing bills of more than £100,000, he says.“It\u0027s one of the deepest human instincts to want to protect what you have saved all your life for: I understand that and this approach would allow people to avoid that injustice. “The option is set to be among a number published in a green paper later this autumn, alongside an NHS 10 year plan.If timing in politics is everything, so far Mr Hancock’s has been fortuitous.His predecessor Jeremy Hunt wore the battle scars of a series of junior doctors strikes, and after a long battle to secure extra funds for the NHS was moved to become foreign secretary soon after securing the promise of a £20bn investment from Theresa May.In the coming months, Mr Hancock will struggle to balance the competing demands for such funds. For now, he is enjoying surveying the territory, with a series of visits on night shifts with paramedics, and visiting hospitals.“I\u0027ve absolutely loved being out on the front line,” he says. “Seeing the camaraderie, the teamwork, the fulfilment - as well as the frustration.”One such visit earlier this month was particularly significant.He returned to Southmead Hospital in Bristol, which last year saved his sister Emily’s life, after a major horse-riding head injury.Emily Gilruth, whose life was saved at Southmead Hospital “Returning was hugely emotional and also cathartic. Her life was hanging in the balance for three, four days. We went back together, Emily and her husband, and of course we had lived through it, whereas she didn’t remember it, but when she saw the doctor again a lot of it all came back.“I’ve always loved the NHS, but that experience really brought it home.” Labour conference live: Party open to second Brexit referendum but John McDonnell says it should not offer option to stay in EURussia to jam signals in Syria and supply regime with more advanced anti-missile technology after plane was shot downNGOs blame Italian populists after last migrant rescue vessel in the Mediterranean has registration revokedComment: Jeremy Corbyn is even more of a Brexit fudger than Theresa MayPrince George steals the show at another wedding as he leads pageboys in game of soldiersBodyguard: why was Budd on the train and what will happen in series 2?

Most of these are obscure.The word ew appears in the new edition of Merriam Webster\u0026#39s Official Scrabble Players DictionaryThere are some sweet scorers now eligible for play, including bizjet, and some words that are ideal for using up vowels, such as arancini, Italian balls of cooked rice.Bizjet, meaning a small plane used for business, would be worth 120 points on an opening play, but only if it is made into a plural with an s.That is due to the 50-point bonus for using all seven tiles and the double word bonus space usually played at the start.The US dictionary company sought counsel from the North American Scrabble Players Association when updating the book, Mr Sokolowski said, to make sure that they agree these words are desirable.Mr Sokolowski has a favourite among the new words but not, primarily, because of Scrabble scores.It\u0027s macaron, he said, referring to the delicate French sandwich cookie featuring different flavours and fillings. I just like what it means, he said.Merriam-Webster put out the first official Scrabble dictionary in 1976. Before that, the game\u0027s rules called for any desk dictionary to be consulted.Since an official dictionary was created, it has been updated every four to eight years.There are other new entries Mr Sokolowski likes, from a wordsmith\u0027s view.I think ew is interesting because it expresses something new about what we\u0027re seeing in language, which is to say that we are now incorporating more of what you might call transcribed speech, he said.Sounds like ew or mm-hmm, or other things like coulda or kinda. Traditionally, they were not in the dictionary but because so much of our communication is texting and social media that is written language, we are finding more transcribed speech and getting a new group of spellings for the dictionary.Yowza is now allowed, along with a word some might have thought was already allowed: zen.Some foreign words have been accepted into English to the degree that they are playable, for example schneid, which has German roots and is a sports term for a losing streak.Other new acceptable words are aquafaba, beatdown, zomboid, twerk, sheeple, wayback, bokeh, botnet, emoji, facepalm, frowny, hivemind, puggle and nubber.Please review our commenting policyLabour conference live: Party open to second Brexit referendum but John McDonnell says it should not offer option to stay in EURussia to jam signals in Syria and supply regime with more advanced anti-missile technology after plane was shot downNGOs blame Italian populists after last migrant rescue vessel in the Mediterranean has registration revokedComment: Jeremy Corbyn is even more of a Brexit fudger than Theresa MayPrince George steals the show at another wedding as he leads pageboys in game of soldiersBodyguard: why was Budd on the train and what will happen in series 2?

And a rise in technology has provided an alternative source of entertainment to students, one vice-chancellor has said.And yet nearly four in five students (79 per cent) still believe that getting drunk is part of university culture – and only one in 10 are aware of responsible drinking activities or campaigns on campus.A first-year student at the University of Glasgow, who wished to remain anonymous, told The Independent that she drinks very rarely as it too expensive and it is does not interest her.She said: “I’m not into clubbing which is what most of my Freshers’ events this year were and so I didn’t really go out much.“It makes for a fairly intimidating calendar if you’re new to university, don’t really drink, and mainly see club nights and pub crawls. It can feel quite isolating.”Eva Crossan Jory, NUS vice president for welfare, said: “It is clear that students’ drinking habits have changed with a comparative section of the student population not drinking at all.“While many students are making active decisions about their drinking, it is concerning that university life is still strongly associated with excessive alcohol consumption.”Edinburgh students to be given gender pronoun badges during freshersSt Andrews University to offer students option to live in alcohol-freeHealth-conscious students cut back on alcohol, but spend on fitnessShe added: “The reality for many is that high levels of personal debt and the pressure to do well means many are going out less and studying more.“The cost-of-living crisis facing students now also means after bills and food it may not be possible for students to spend on other things such as nights out or drinks.”The NUS says more universities should introduce “inclusive spaces” for teetotal students on campus.A number of universities and students unions have increased the number of alcohol-free events they run to meet the rising demand – and more are introducing alcohol-free student halls.The University of St Andrews – which has offered alcohol-free accommodation since 2015 – said it was unable to place all students who requested rooms this year as it is such a popular option.It plans to expand the halls if demand continues to increase. Student president Paloma Paige, said: “The success of such accommodation is a very positive step towards ensuring that all students have a comfortable and enjoyable accommodation experience when they come to St Andrews.”\u0026nbspBristol students union has expanded its non-alcohol events programme for freshers’ week after a plant-potting workshop last year was a success. Meanwhile, Leeds students union has introduced classes on how to make pottery and coffee to meet a rising demand for alcohol-free activities,A Leeds students union spokesperson said: “With the\u0026nbspfee rise, students feel more pressure than ever to get a good grade, and put a lot of emphasis on studying.” \u0026nbsp“Students don’t want to damage the day after a night out with a hangover, especially if they need to study or just want to enjoy their day,” the spokesperson added.UK news in picturesLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn has stated that he will support a second referendum on Brexit if the Labour membership votes for one at this week\u0027s party conference.

But they come at a cost, and one that is not easy to swallow.And from Friday the Xs and Xs Max have gone on sale in the UK and around the world, meaning UK networks are battling to offer customers the best deals on the new iPhones.(The iPhone Xr, which might offer considerably better value for money, is not going to be released until October. It might be well worth waiting for: it has many of the same features as the Xs, but starts at £749 rather than £999.)Here are the various ways to buy an iPhone Xs now.Buying a phone is not necessarily the cheapest way of buying an iPhone, and it requires you to have the most amount of money to hand. But the flip side is that you get everything sorted out in one go, you won\u0027t have payments hanging over your head, and you\u0027re free to do what you want with the phone.iPhone XS launch in September 2018111 Tim Cook speaks about the iPhone XS and XS MaxTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks about the iPhone XS and XS Max at an Apple Inc product launch event 211 Tim Cook speaking at the iPhone launchTim Cook, CEO of Apple, speaks on stage at the end of the Apple Inc311 Tim Cook speaking during the event411 Phil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketingPhil Schiller, Apple\u0027s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, speaks about the Apple iPhone XS and Apple iPhone XS Max511 Phil Schiller speaks about the new iPhone XRPhilip W.

So it can be worth going through your network, and paying upfront for the phone with them while still committing to a phone plan.If you\u0027re on the other side of that situation – you don\u0027t want to pay upfront at all, and offset the cost through the length of the plan – then there are plenty of ways to do that. Obviously, you will pay for it in that the price over the two years will add up to significantly more, but you\u0027ll also have the benefit of never having to make such a significant outlay.There are plenty of networks offering limited upfront payments, such as Virgin Mobile, which claims to have the cheapest deal with no upfront costs. You can get the Xs for £41 per month without any initial payment, and pay an extra £9 for a full 50GB per month.The least painful way to get the iPhone Xs or Xs Max is probably to go somewhere in between. Which is best will depend on how much you want to pay upfront and what sort of allowances you want, of course, but the networks are falling over themselves to offer you deals on the new phone.Three, for instance, is asking for £59 for all you can eat data with a £99 payment at the beginning. It\u0027s not the cheapest deal, but unlimited data is rare, and it is decent.The Max is £5 more from Three. And you can add another £6 on top per month to get some AirPods, too.If you\u0027re concerned about committing for two years – especially when next year\u0027s iPhone is likely to offer more spectacular upgrades than the Xs – then you might want to consider Sky Mobile, which allows people to upgrade every year with its Swap12 plan.\u0026nbspThe Xs starts at £59 per month on that plan, with a £99 upfront payment.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/17/11/aran-islands-cart-1950s-ireland.jpg","title":"travel ireland aran islands visit travel accommodation to do remote","story":"Created with Sketch.At the end of the 19th\u0026nbspcentury, playwright JM Synge\u0026nbspescaped to the\u0026nbspstripped back and simple life on\u0026nbspInishmore, Inishmaan\u0026nbspand Inisheer. Today, little has changed on the islandsClick to followThe IndependentIn the 1950s, transportation on the islands was by a pony-drawn cart and even today there are few carsThe last time I saw Bridin Concannon, she was walking towards me along the narrow road on the westernmost edge of the island of Inishmaan, off the west coast of Ireland.“Were you out at Synge’s Chair?” I called out as she approached.The sun behind her hung, unmasked by clouds, low and long in the Irish early summer sky.“I was,” she said. Her voice was strong, clear – the way one’s voice can be when exhilarated. “I’ll start writing a play soon.”We both laughed loudly, and strode past one another. She was headed back towards the village and I towards the cliffs over the North Atlantic, to a perch of limestone that the author frequented during his time here, a spot known locally as Synge’s Chair.The Irish playwright JM\u0026nbspSynge (1871-1909) first came to the Aran Islands in the summer of 1898 looking for inspiration and to learn the Irish language. Over the next several years he would return again and again, growing more connected to the people and the wind-and-sea-battered land they inhabited.Synge’s most famous work\u0026nbspPlayboy of the Western World\u0026nbspwas inspired by a story he heard while on the islands, and caused riots in Dublin when it was first staged in 1906. The foremost playwright of the Irish Renaissance – a movement inspired by strong political nationalism and a revival of Celtic traditions – Synge was co-founder of The Abbey Theatre, also known as the National Theatre of Ireland. All six of his plays are either set in or heavily influenced by his time in Aran.The three remote Aran Islands of Inishmore, Inishmaan and Inisheer hide in plain sight in the mouth of Galway Bay. They are still predominantly Irish-speaking, insular and, as even in Synge’s era, considered a place lost in time.It was the poet William Butler Yeats who suggested that Synge come to these islands. “Go to Aran,” Yeats told his friend. “Live there as if you were one of the people themselves express a life that has never found expression.”Synge grew more attached to the islands over time, and I had a notion that repeat trips might similarly enhance my appreciation of Aran’s more subtle charms. I decided to visit the islands over a period of several months, from early spring to high summer. I hoped that my repeated act of return and departure would elicit in me the sense of investment, as well as illuminate details and patterns of day-to-day local life that are the deep appeal of such places as Aran, places not needy of a traveller’s attention.Synge took a steamer from Galway that sailed at the mercy of the tides, on the rolling sea, and transferred into a currach, a small canvas-covered fishing boat, to make it to shore. These days things are slightly easier, with a daily ferry schedule as well as light aircraft service.My initial impression of the largest island of Inishmore from the ferry was not dissimilar to Synge’s:.\u0026nbsp“A dreary rock appeared at first sloping up from the sea and into the fog,” the author wrote in The Aran Islands –\u0026nbsphis classic account of his time here, first published in 1907. “The place looked hardly fit for habitation. There was no green to be seen, and no sign of the people.”Part of the considerable allure of Aran lies in what it lacks. There are no cinemas and few cars electricity only arrived in the 1970s. Seventeen-year-old Thomas Kennedy summed it up for me within minutes of my arrival when he said:\u0026nbsp“There’s no facilities here – you rely on the people.” And while much has remained unchanged since Synge’s time, society has reached the islands. Synge wasn’t confronted with the dozen or so glamping structures visible on arrival, for one. And the pierside Atlantic Hotel, where Synge resided while on Inishmore, has been transformed into the Aran Sweater Market.But beside the shop, three pubs, one food shop, a restaurant and a handful of bed and breakfasts, there is little else in the way of commerce. The 12 square mile island is home to roughly 760 people, most clustered around the main settlement of Kilronan, with the vast majority of terrain given over to small parcels of grazing and farmland, delineated by Aran’s most dominant feature, its dry-stone walls.“You have to be OK within yourself to live here,” Melissa Gillian told me as I stood eavesdropping on a wedding reception outside the Aran Island Hotel. A Maine native, she married a local man and has lived on Inishmore for 10 years. Gillian was one of only a handful of outsiders I met over the months – all are married to locals her sentiment was one I heard often, on all three islands.Most visitors stay only a few hours, travel a well-worn circuit and hustle back onto the boats for the comparative metropolis of Galway or the pubs of Doolin. But it is during the early morning hours, and again later in the afternoon once the last ferry of the day has gone, that the island’s deeper appeal emerges.If you’ve seen one image of the Aran Islands, it is likely to be an aerial shot of Inishmore’s Dun Aengus, semicircular stone walls that abut a 300-foot sheer cliff above the Atlantic. The initial walls of this ring fort – one of seven to be found on the islands – date back to 1100BC, and it is next to impossible not to gravitate to the site while on Inishmore. A visit at daybreak was rewarded by absolute solitude, as the wind whistled over the stones. Birds caught thermals below the cliffs. Clouds raced across the sun. Time stretched.As I was leaving, the buses began to arrive. I sat on a wall eating a Nutella crêpe\u0026nbspand watched coach after coach deposit people with fanny packs and (unneeded) sun hats. Though watching the human drama of group tourism from a slight remove has its own rewards, I had a date with a magic well.Early on during Synge’s first visit to Inishmore, he met a man who told him a story. A Sligo woman, it seems, had a dream that her blind son might be made to see if she travelled to a particular well out on the Aran Islands. She did so, and upon touching the well’s water to her sightless child’s eye, he exclaimed, “O mother, look at the pretty flowers!” Synge would use this story and his visit to the site as the inspiration for his play\u0026nbspThe Well of the Saints.My local map indicated the well as a tiny dot not far off the road, yet I’d cycled past it twice without luck. Finally I caught sight of an old sign that directed me over one stone fence and then another, through several fields, until I came upon the ruin of a tiny building:\u0026nbspThe Church of the Four Beautiful Persons\u0026nbsp(no one I met on the island could explain the origins of the name). I stepped over cow pats and entered. The sun emerged and the grey stones brightened. At that moment, a cow poked her head inside to see who was on her turf.Pope Francis visits Ireland – in picturesPope Francis celebrates the Holy Mass at the Phoenix Park, in Dublin Pope Francis arrives at Phoenix Park for a Papal Mass of the World Meeting of Families in DublinA vigil takes place at the site of the mass grave which contained the remains of 796 named babies from the Bon Secours Mother and Baby home in Tuam.

A tin cup had been left beside it, and someone had tossed in a small crucifix. A small pile of stones, similar to the ones that covered the well’s floor, sat next to it, apparently meant to be thrown in the well. As a long-ago lapsed Catholic, this ritual seemed to me somehow more pagan than Christian. I tossed a few in, thinking of my children.Back in town, the crowds were converging for the afternoon ferry to the mainland. On impulse, I grabbed my bag, deciding again to follow Synge’s lead – this time to another of the islands.After only a brief stay on Inishmore, the playwright headed for Inishmaan, of which he noted:\u0026nbsp“Gaelic is more generally used, and the life is perhaps the most primitive that is left in Europe.”I wondered how much things had changed, and as I headed to the ferry for the short crossing to the middle island, Loraine Conneely, an Inishmore native, read my mind. “You’ll see,” she said. “It’s still the same over there. It hasn’t moved.”If the traveller is greeted with a (relatively) bustling arrival on the big island, no such welcome – in fact, no welcome at all – awaits the visitor in Inishmaan, which is less than four square miles. The ferry dock is a half-hour walk to what passes for a village (there is one shop and one bar). Life, as it did in Synge’s time, revolves around the caprices of weather and the ties of community.Little energy is spent looking outward – exactly how the 160 inhabitants prefer things.Over my months of coming and going, I encountered many of the same people again and again on Inishmaan: Ciaran O’Ceallaigh, who was raising his son on the island because he wanted him “to grow up in a true Irish-speaking environment” Bartley Conneely, who owned 21 acres and six cows, and could easily be persuaded to give a visitor a lift to the ferry and the pair of ladies I often saw when out walking, who cautioned me against staying too late up at the ring fort of Dun Fearbhai, lest the fairies interfere with me.Synge noted many stories of strange happenings on the island. “These people make no distinction between the natural and the supernatural,” he wrote. But he also eloquently described a people living a hard-scrabble life very close to the elements: “Of beings who feel their isolation in the face of a universe that wars on them with winds and sea.” Synge encountered people who carried themselves with workaday dignity and offered a humble, sincere welcome – exactly what I found on Inishmaan 120 years later.“We’re ambivalent about tourists on this island,” the restaurateur Ruairi de Blacam told me. “You’re left to go about your business. Get a map – you’ve got shoes – and off you go.” De Blacam is a local boy who made (extremely) good. In 2007 he and his wife, Marie-Therese, opened Inis Meáin, the singular high-end restaurant and inn on the islands.“It’s unlikely, if not impossible, we could have done this if I wasn’t from the island,” he said as I sipped some of his delicious lobster bisque and watched a setting fireball sun slash light across the limestone just outside the restaurant’s picture window. “You need the people’s support.”He continued: “We’re on a precarious perch out here in the ocean. People lean on each other in all sorts of ways. When I was a kid, I went around with a candle and people still dressed in traditional clothes. Ireland was 20, 30 years behind the rest of the world, and Aran was 20, 30 years behind Ireland.”The sun dropped, as Synge wrote of a similar sunset a century earlier, “like a lozenge of gold flame into the sea” and the ocean was cast in a purple hue.“But things are moving fast we’re catching up a bit,” de Blacam smiled and placed a dish of scallop ceviche with toasted almonds in front of me.“What you have to understand is that the people here live a very simple life. And we’re here by choice. There’s an understated pride, and the legacy of Synge is certainly a part of that.”Very much so: The cottage to which the playwright returned each year – a small, whitewashed, thatch-roof affair – has been preserved as a museum of sorts. Though it’s technically open to the public, hours vary, and it took some doing, to track down Ciaran O’Faherty, whose great-grandparents had offered Synge a bedroom in what was then their home. Once I finally cornered him in the pub, O’Faherty was happy to oblige me with a look. On this island that insists on existing out of time, the cottage’s green front door was a portal through the century things inside remain as Synge had described: “My room is at one end of the cottage … There is a kitchen with earth floor and open rafters … It is full of beauty and distinction.”As much as Synge relished his island home, he spent most of his days out walking the land. Over on the far western side, atop high cliffs, he found a stand of rock looking out over Galway Bay and Inishmore that he would return to again and again. “As I lay here hour after hour, I seem to enter into the wild pastimes of the cliff,” he wrote.This was when I found myself headed out to Synge’s Chair. The semicircle cluster of limestone created a natural barrier against the elements, cradled the visitor and invited lingering. Each of my visits was similar time slipped the way time can when there is nowhere to go: at first excruciatingly slowly, then in a blink, the day would be gone.With just the one pub for action, nights on Inishmaan are quiet and even a loner can yearn for society. As Synge did, I made the short crossing to the smallest island of Inisheer (on two occasions I was the only ferry passenger from Inishmaan). Upon coming ashore, Synge was confronted with a man –\u0026nbsp“a drunkard and shebeener” – who lived “with the restlessness of a man who has no sympathy with his companions.” Upon my arrival I was met with an only slightly less distressing social challenge.As on Inishmore, the day tourist trade had taken hold. There were horse and trap rides, coffee carts and stands selling local fudge. But just beyond the flurry of town, Inisheer, with its 250 residents, is perhaps the most physically picturesque of the three Aran Islands, and its three square miles make it easy to navigate on bicycle. (Bikes were readily available directly off the ferry on both Inishmore and Inisheer. Not surprisingly, there was no bike rental on Inishmaan.)Atop the island’s highest hill, beside the ruin of O’Brien’s Castle, Aine O’Graiofa had put a few tables out in front of her home and called it a restaurant. I took a seat in the driveway and settled in for one of Ireland’s staple country lunches – ham and cheese on toasted white bread – while looking down across Galway Bay to Connemara in the distance.Inisheer boasts three pubs, one shop and a church.“The priest died four years ago and they haven’t sent another,” O’Graiofa told me. “We’re left to our own devices.”We chatted of the decline in the church’s dominance over the people throughout Ireland.“Sure it’s their own fault,” she said. “We have the old schoolteacher who goes up and leads folks in the rosary that’s all we need.”Watching a ferry cross the bay down below, I asked if it was heading for Inishmaan.Businesses call for gay marriage to be legalised in Northern IrelandHIV rates rise in Northern Ireland – despite falling across rest of UKThe motley crew lining up to contest the Irish presidential election“I doubt it. You go over there and you don’t see a soul they’re all hiding behind the stones.”We laughed, but soon enough I made my way down to the dock.Back on Inishmaan I walked past the old graveyard from which Synge took inspiration for his play Riders to the Sea, and continued up the hill, across from Synge’s cottage and up over five stone fences and through five small fields to the ring fort of Dun Chonchuir. Synge would “often stroll up there after a dinner of eggs or salt pork, to smoke drowsily on the stones.”Like Synge, I had sat on these walls and viewed the sea in nearly every direction, but on this evening, a fog rolled in. The air became moist. Summer changed to autumn in a matter of minutes. I could barely make out the far end of the small fort enclosure. With no wind, a heavy silence hung in the mist. The century that separated me from Synge seemed suddenly trivial, and a world beyond these dry stone walls didn’t matter at all.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social

IndependentUK could face droughts next spring after summer heatwave, experts warnWater companies, government bodies and environmental groups have warned that the extreme weather this summer could lead to a drought in spring next year.Heatwaves across the country saw hosepipe bans come into force and put pressure on farmers, whose harvests were affected by the dry conditions.The National Drought Group (NDG), which is made up of various water and environment organisations, gathered on Thursday to discuss how to maintain supplies in the event of a 2019 drought.Despite recent rainfall, they warned that parts of the north of England are under particular strain as reservoirs around Manchester, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent are very low.The current environmental situation is still fragile, and higher-than-average rainfall throughout autumn and winter will be necessary to avert spring water shortages.If rainfall is below average, water restrictions for the British public will be likely in early 2019.Historic sites across UK exposed by heatwaveCrop marks show of the old garden at Gawthorpe Hall, LancashireGarden at Gawthorpe Hall, Lancashire which was taken out in the 1940\u0027s but

situation.“Ensuring sufficient water for the public, the economy and the environment is one of biggest challenges we face as a country,” he said.“The Environment Agency will continue to work actively with the water companies and other water users to seek to ensure that.”Dry conditions over the summer were linked to\u0026nbspdevastating fires around Oldham and Bolton, and caused\u0026nbspdisruption to British wildlife including hedgehogs, birds and frogs.The Environment Agency responded to more than 300 dry-weather related incidents over the past few months, more than three times the usual number for the summer.Farmers accused the government of taking “little action” after environment\u0026nbspsecretary Michael Gove pledged to help them recover from the challenging summer conditions.Recent efforts to save water combined with spells of rain have helped the sector recover, but for some crops and species the\u0026nbspfull effects of the summer are yet to be seen.Water companies say they are implementing measures such as reducing leaks and identifying new water sources to prepare for next year.“But this is not just a matter for the organisations at National Drought Group,” said Sir James.“We all use water, and everyone has a role to play in ensuring we continue to have reliable access to it, so we encourage everyone to please use water wisely.”Enter your email

the country at tackling climate change, with considerable progress in switching to clean energy.However, in a new report government advisers have stated that there is no room for complacency as these successes mask failures to clean up other sectors such as transport and agriculture.The country has been able to make a big impact by investing in renewable energy sources over fossil fuels – action that saw emissions drop by 10 per cent in 2016 alone.However, following the closure of the country’s\u0026nbsplast remaining coal-fired plant that same year, the Committee on Climate Change has urged the Scottish government to broaden its scope.“Scotland continues to lead the UK in reducing its emissions and has ambitious targets which aim to go further,” said Lord Deben, chair of the committee.“Decarbonisation of Scotland’s electricity sector, and reductions in emissions from waste, have seen Scotland outperform the UK overall as emissions continue to fall year-on-year to nearly half of 1990 levels.”10 photographs to show to anyone who doesn\u0027t believe in climate changeA group of emperor penguins face a crack in the sea ice, near McMurdo Station, AntarcticaAmid a flood in

We very rarely have referendums in this country, the people have decided against my wishes and my union’s wishes, but they have decided.“So if the parliamentarians, if spineless Tory MPs, lose the courage of their convictions and won’t vote against whatever deal comes back, then my union and Labour’s policy at the moment is to say, ‘Well, if you are incapable of carrying out your functions in parliament, we should take the deal back to the people.”For us now to enter into some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again, I think would be wrongA YouGov poll commissioned by the People’s Vote campaign showed nearly 90 per cent of Labour Party members want another referendum, three-quarters would like to see a commitment in Labour’s manifesto – but critically, it shows that 93 per cent would vote to stay in the EU if they were given a chance.But Mr McCluskey said: “There are significant numbers of traditional Labour supporters who are saying, ‘We’re going to vote Conservative because we don’t trust Labour to take us out of the European Union’, despite the fact that Jeremy has said repeatedly ‘of course, we recognise the result, of course we respect the result, we are coming out of the European Union’.“For us now to enter into some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again, I think would be wrong.”Spelling out how he sees a new referendum playing out, he said the question must be narrowly confined to approval of any deal Ms May brings back from Brussels.Jeremy Corbyn has shifted significantly towards a new referendumCorbyn told Marr he is an \u0027antiracist\u0027, but he\u0027s not that good at itWorkers to make up one third of company board members under LabourCorbyn will back new Brexit referendum if Labour conference wants it Jeremy Corbyn will face an open goal if he backs a second referendumHe went on: “If the people vote against the deal then we are back to the other scenario.

Everything was ready, except a small but important detail: Jennyfer’s passport.It is now five months since Jennyfer Avero applied for her travel document. But, until today, the 23-year-old craftswoman from Caracas hasn’t anything about the state of her request.\u0026nbspLast month, her boyfriend Javier left for\u0026nbspEcuador, becoming part of one of the biggest exoduses in Latin American history. And in the meantime, Jennyfer continues to wait, hoping she will join him soon.“I have no alternative,” she says. “I wouldn’t like to leave without a passport.”Venezuela’s intensifying economic and political crisis has pushed hundreds of thousands to flee the country. They are in search of food, security, medicine and jobs.But not everyone\u0026nbspthat makes the decision to leave has a valid passport. Venezuelans face multiple difficulties when trying to obtain this document. Some people can wait months, or even years, to get it. The process can be complicated, expensive and sometimes illegal.Day after day crowds queue up outside the headquarters of the passport agency, known as Saime, in Caracas.Saime has more than 200 offices nationwide, however many people come to the headquarters in Caracas hoping to get a passport. Here the possibilities are greater, users say.Everyone is here – women, children, couples and elderly people. Some arrived before dawn\u0026nbspothers, those who came from afar, spent the night here. Much of them share the desire to leave the country for good.“This is the fourth time in three months I’ve come here,” says Jose Di Marco, while standing in line.Di Marco travelled 713km by bus from the town of Puerto Ordaz to Caracas. For the second consecutive day, the 20-year-old student has been sleeping at a nearby square to avoid losing his spot in the queue.He should be travelling to Ecuador at the end of the month. He has been awarded a full scholarship to study performing arts, but if he doesn’t arrive in time it will be taken away.Without answers about the status of his application, which he has been processing since 2016, he’s starting to feel desperate.“I’ve thought about leaving without a passport, I can’t waste more time,” he says.AFPGetty Images)The passport system began to fail two years ago. In theory, the process is easy. It’s done through a web page in which the citizen requests an appointment, attends the appointment and is given the passport within a couple of weeks. But often, users say, the website crashes and the appointment gets cancelled or people’s data just disappears from the system.“It’s as if I had never attended the appointment,” says Delia Cabral, 52, whose data disappeared from the website after she went to her meeting.The accountant has been waiting since May for her passport. Her daughter is waiting for her in Spain.It’s as if I had never attended the appointment\u0026nbspExperts say that Caracas’s telecommunication infrastructure is one of the weakest in the region, so it is not surprising that high-traffic websites collapse.In July, a new head of Saime was named. He promised a complete renovation of the website, as well as a profound restructuring of the organisation. However, the system still seems to be failing.The passport agency has blamed shortages of materials, like paper and plastic, for the delays.Venezuela has been suffering from shortages of food, medicines and other basic goods for many years now. The lack of passports is just one of them.The legal price of a passport in Venezuela is 18 bolivars, or $0.30 (£0.23) at the black market exchange rate. However, tired of waiting, some Venezuelans choose to pay for the service of officials who can speed up the process for $1,000, at the very least. A prohibitively expensive amount for most Venezuelans,given the monthly minimum wage is $18.Maduro urges Venezuelan migrants to return home from ‘economic slavery’ in other countriesThis is an illegal practice for which several Saime officials have been arrested in recent months. The institution also blames those members of the “mafia”\u0026nbspinside the passport agency for the delays.The economic and social crisis has become so unbearable that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans consider escaping the country to be their only option – a feeling that has only increased over the past few months.President Nicolas Maduro denies the existence of a migration crisis and blames his critics for inflating the numbers.The government typically does not publish data, but the UN estimates that 2.3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015, especially to neighbouring countries like Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. In August, the UN warned the migration exodus was reaching a “crisis moment”,\u0026nbspakin to the situation in Mediterranean.\u0026nbspLast month, Ecuador and Peru tightened their migration controls for Venezuelans, requiring them to show valid passports at the border. That decision left many Venezuelans who had been travelling without passports in limbo.The measure was later overturned. Over recent weeks, 11 Latin American countries agreed to allow Venezuelans to enter their countries even if their passports have expired.While this is a relief for those who haven’t been able to renew their travel documents, nothing changes for those who have never had a passport, like Jennyfer.“It makes no difference for me,” she says “I’m still stuck in here.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/10/08/muslims-china.jpg","title":"china uighurs human rights muslims orphanages xinjiang province reeducation","story":"Created with Sketch.‘It’s like my kids are in jail,’\u0026nbspsays 29-year-old mother living in exileStaff and agenciesClick to followThe IndependentChina is putting Uighur children in \u0027orphanages\u0027 even if their parents are aliveChinese authorities are putting the children of Uighurs and other ethnic minority groups into dozens of state-run orphanages across the western Xinjiang region even if their parents are not dead, as some 1 million adults in their families are sent to internment camps.The orphanages are the most recent manifestation of Beijing’s efforts to systematically distance young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture. Uighurs fear such efforts are erasing their ethnic identity, one child at a time.\u0026nbspIn Istanbul,\u0026nbspa dozen Uighur families spoke to reporters during the Muslim holy festival Eid al-Adha, which comes with large family reunions. Tables in every home were resplendent with traditional Xinjiang dishes like homemade noodles, freshly butchered lamb and crispy naan.\u0026nbspBut the Uighurs who fled China to avoid detention described the\u0026nbsppainful absence of the children they left behind – who they believe are now in the hands of the very government tearing their families apart.\u0026nbspSome did not want their full names used for fear of retribution against relatives still in Xinjiang.Every morning, Meripet wakes up to her nightmare: the Chinese government has turned four of her children into orphans, even though she and their father are alive.\u0026nbspMeripet and her husband left the kids with their grandmother at home in China when they went to nurse Meripet’s sick father in Turkey. But after Chinese authorities started locking up thousands of their fellow ethnic Uighurs for alleged subversive crimes such as travel abroad, that\u0026nbspvisit became exile.\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbspher mother-in-law was also taken prisoner, and Meripet learned from a friend that her offspring, aged between three and eight,\u0026nbsphad been placed in a de facto orphanage in the Xinjiang region\u0026nbspunder the care of the state that broke up her family.\u0026nbsp“It’s like my kids are in jail,” Meripet said, her voice cracking. “My four children are separated from me and living like orphans.”\u0026nbspMeripet’s family is among tens of thousands swept up by President Xi Jinping‘s campaign to subdue a sometimes restive region, including the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities that has alarmed a United Nations panel and the US\u0026nbspgovernment. The UK Foreign Office also believes Beijing has “introduced intrusive security and surveillance measures and cultural restrictions” aimed at the Uighur people, including “re-education camps”.Now there is evidence that the government is placing the children of detainees and exiles into dozens of orphanages across Xinjiang.\u0026nbspThe institutions are the latest example of how China is systematically distancing young Muslims in Xinjiang from their families and culture,\u0026nbspinterviews with more than a dozen people and a review of procurement documents suggest. The government has been building thousands of so-called “bilingual” schools, where minority children are taught in Mandarin and penalised for speaking in their native tongues. Some of these are boarding schools, which Uighurs say can be mandatory for children and, in one Kazakh family’s case, start from the age of five.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs fear that these measures are essentially wiping out their ethnic identity, one child at a time. Experts say what China is doing echoes how white colonialists in the US, Canada and Australia treated indigenous children – policies that have left generations traumatised.\u0026nbsp“This is an ethnic group whose knowledge base is being erased,” said Darren Byler, a researcher of Uighur culture at University of Washington. “What we’re looking at is something like a settler colonial situation where an entire generation is lost.”\u0026nbspFor Meripet, the loss is agony it is the absence of her children and the knowledge they are in state custody. A year and a half after leaving home, the 29-year-old mother looked at a photo of a brightly painted building surrounded by barbed wire where her children are believed to be held. She fell silent. And then she wept.\u0026nbsp“When I finally see them again, will they even recognise me?” she asked. “Will I recognise them?”\u0026nbspWhen Mr Xi came to power in 2012, an early challenge to his rule was a surge in violent attacks that killed several hundred people and which Beijing pinned on Uighur separatists. Since then, he\u0026nbsphas overseen the most extensive effort in recent years to quell Xinjiang, appointing in 2016 the former Tibet party boss Chen Quanguo to lead the troubled region bordering Afghanistan.\u0026nbspChen rolled out unprecedented security measures such as the internment camps that hold Muslims without trial and force them to renounce their faith and swear loyalty to the ruling Communist Party. China has described religious extremism as an illness that needs to be cured through what it calls “transformation through education”. Former detainees say one can be thrown into a camp for praying regularly, reading the Quran, going abroad or even speaking to someone overseas.\u0026nbspThe camps are among the most troubling aspects of Mr Xi’s campaign to assert the party’s dominance over all aspects of Chinese life, which has drawn comparisons with Mao Zedong. Authorities heeding Mr Xi’s call to “Sinicise” religion across the country have shut underground churches, burnt\u0026nbspBibles, replaced pictures of Jesus with ones of the president, and toppled crescents from mosques. The party also has beefed up its ability to track the movements of its 1.4 billion people, with Xinjiang serving as an important testing ground.\u0026nbspIn Xinjiang, detention has left countless children without their parents. Most of these families in China cannot be reached by journalists. However, reporters interviewed 14 Uighur families living in Turkey and one Kazakh man in Almaty with a total of 56 children who remain in China.\u0026nbspThe families say that among these children, 14 are known to be in state-run orphanages and boarding schools. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown because most of their adult relatives in Xinjiang have been detained.\u0026nbspSome interviewees, like Meripet, requested that they be identified only by their first names because they feared official retaliation against their relatives. Others insisted their full names be used despite the risks, saying they were desperate for their stories to be heard. They pleaded with reporters to track down their families in Xinjiang, and one interviewee pressed a piece of paper into a reporter’s hand with a Chinese address scribbled on it.\u0026nbspThe regional government appears to be moving quickly to build centres to house the children of these exiles and of detainees. A review of procurement notices in Xinjiang has found that since the start of last year, the government has budgeted more than $30m\u0026nbsp(200 million Chinese yuan, £22.7m) to build or expand at least 45 orphanages, known variously as “welfare centres” and “protection centres”, with enough beds to house about 5,000 children.\u0026nbspIn July and August alone, the government invited bids for the construction of at least nine centres for the “protection of disadvantaged children” in the Xinjiang city of Hotan and several counties in Kashgar, Aksu and Kizilsu prefectures, inhabited primarily by ethnic minority groups. Most orphanages have a minimum of 100 beds mandated by the government, and some are much larger. One notice called for an orphanage in Moyu county with four four-story dormitories, coming to 22,776 sq\u0026nbspmetres in size – bigger than three\u0026nbspfootball pitches.\u0026nbspThese numbers do not include kindergartens and other schools where some children of Uighur detainees are being housed. It’s impossible to tell how many children of detainees end up at these schools because they also serve other children.\u0026nbspShi Yuqing, a Kashgar civil affairs official, said that “authorities provide aid and support to everyone in need, whether they’re the children of convicted criminals or people killed in traffic accidents”. But such services may not be welcome. A government report from Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in June last year acknowledged that relatives were resistant to “handing over” their extended families’ kids to the orphanages because they “lack trust or confidence” in the centres.\u0026nbspA friend told Meripet last November her four children were living in the Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten in southern Xinjiang. The friend said Meripet’s sister-in-law had visited her children and was permitted to take them home for one night only.\u0026nbspThe school looks like a house-sized castle, with a bright marigold facade, orange turrets and blue rooftops. Its entrance is blocked by an iron gate and a walled enclosure lined with barbed wire. “We Are Happy and Grateful to the Motherland”, say the red characters emblazoned on one fence.\u0026nbspThe principal, who gave only her last name, Ai, told reporters that the institution was “just a normal kindergarten”. But the authorities’ anxiety was clear: armed police officers surrounded the reporters’ car minutes after their arrival at the school and ordered them to delete any photos.\u0026nbspGu Li, a propaganda official for Hotan who also immediately appeared on the scene, added: “There are really young kids here – some of them may even be orphans whose parents have died.”\u0026nbspHotan City Kindness Kindergarten (AP)A report published this February in the Xinjiang Daily, a party newspaper, called Hotan City Kindness Kindergarten a “free, full-time” kindergarten for children aged six and younger that provides accommodations and clothing to those whose “parents cannot care for them for a variety of reasons”.\u0026nbsp“Soon after many of the kids arrived at the school, they grew taller and got fatter, and quickly started using Mandarin to communicate,” the article said. Another state media report in January said $1.24m had been invested in the kindergarten.\u0026nbspSatellite imagery shows that the kindergarten had been constructed less than three years ago, just as an initiative was launched to strengthen “bilingual” education in Xinjiang. More than 4,300 bilingual kindergartens were built or renovated last year, according to the government. A report on the project in a state-run regional newspaper said such kindergartens taught children “civilised living habits”.\u0026nbsp“The children started educating their parents: your hands are too dirty, your clothes are too dirty, you haven’t brushed your teeth,” the report quoted Achilem Abduwayit, a deputy chief of the Hotan city education bureau, as saying.\u0026nbspLife in an orphanage could have a lasting psychological and cultural impact on children, said James Leibold, an expert on Chinese ethnic policy at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia.\u0026nbsp“You grow up as a ward of the state,” he said. “They’re told to be patriotic citizens, told that the identity and religion of their parents was abnormal, if not radical, and thus needs to be eradicated.”\u0026nbspMeripet has at least an inkling of where her children are. Her brother, a 37-year-old doctor named Aziz, has not heard any news of his three youngest children since his wife was taken to a re-education centre in June 2017.\u0026nbspAziz fled to Turkey more than a year ago after he received a call from his local police station ordering him to report to authorities immediately. More than half his neighbours had already been taken away to re-education centres or prison, he said.\u0026nbspNow the young doctor is often shaken awake by a nightmare in which his kids are huddling at the bottom of a cliff, their faces smudged with dirt, calling to him to hoist them up. Aziz walks for what feels like hours but cannot reach them. He awakens with their cries ringing in his ears.\u0026nbsp“If I could, I would choose not to have been born as a Uighur, to not have been born in Xinjiang,” Aziz said. “We are the most unfortunate ethnic group in the world.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesA boat has capsized killing at 136 people in Lake Victoria, Tanzania.

A former teacher at a “bilingual” kindergarten outside Kashgar said all lessons were given in Mandarin and the entirely Uighur student body was banned from speaking Uighur at school. A colleague who used Uighur to explain concepts to students was fired, according to the teacher, who lives in Turkey but asked for anonymity because she fears retribution against family in China.\u0026nbspLike all schools in China, this one immersed children in patriotic education. Kindergarten textbooks were filled with songs like “Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China”, the teacher said.\u0026nbspDilnur, a 35-year-old business student in exile in Istanbul, said officials regularly visited her children’s kindergarten in Kashgar and asked the students if their parents read religious verses at home or participated in other faith-based activities. The questions effectively forced children to spy on their own families. A man was taken away by police after his grandson said in class that he had made a pilgrimage to Mecca, she said.\u0026nbspHer seven-year-old daughter once complained that her throat was sore from chanting party slogans. “Mama, what does it mean to love the motherland?” she asked.\u0026nbspSome bilingual schools are boarding schools, which are not uncommon in China. Xinjiang has long provided voluntary boarding school programmes that are seen as coveted opportunities for the best minority students. But several Uighurs asserted that in many cases boarding school was now mandatory for minority children, even though Han Chinese children could choose to continue living at home.\u0026nbspThe Xinjiang government did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The government has said the tuition-free boarding schools relieve parents of education and living expenses and help raise Mandarin standards, which will make their children more employable.\u0026nbspBut Uighurs say they do not want their culture erased.\u0026nbspGulzar Seley, who was detained in China along with her newborn son, is placed on a table in the home of her husband Halmurat Idris in Istanbul (AP)“If the kids are forced to speak Mandarin and live like Han Chinese every day, I’m afraid they won’t be like us anymore,” said Meriyem Yusup, whose extended family has four children sent to state-run orphanages in Xinjiang.\u0026nbspAdil Dalelkhan, an ethnic Kazakh sock merchant in exile in Almaty, said that even though his then five-year-old son could live with relatives, he was forced to stay at his preschool Monday\u0026nbspthrough Friday instead. The father called the policy a “terrifying” step towards extinguishing Kazakh culture.\u0026nbspA Uighur businessman in Istanbul, also named Adil, told a similar story. Adil’s son was nine\u0026nbspyears old when the school system automatically transferred him to a boarding school. All children of a certain age in their Uighur district were obliged to attend boarding school, Adil said. His son was only permitted to come home on weekends and holidays.\u0026nbsp“There were iron bars like we saw in a zoo in Kashgar,” Adil recalled.\u0026nbspDilnur said her neighbours too were only allowed to visit their kids at boarding school on Wednesday nights, and even then they had to hand them sweets through a fence.\u0026nbsp“The educational goals are secondary to the political goals,” said Timothy Grose, a professor at Indiana’s Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology who has done research on Xinjiang boarding schools. “They aim to dissolve loyalties to ethnic identity ... toward a national identity.”\u0026nbspA government notice posted in February in Kashgar states that children in the fourth grade and above with parents in detention must be sent to boarding school immediately – even if one parent is still at home. Students must be instilled with socialist values, the notice said, and be taught to “be grateful for education and love and repay the motherland”, and avoid the “75 types of behaviour that show religious extremism”. Such behaviour ranges from calling for “holy war” to growing beards and quitting smoking and drinking for religious reasons, the government says.\u0026nbspChina insists it guarantees\u0026nbspfreedom of religion, but Uighurs view the Chinese education system as a threat to it. In schools, children are taught to respect teachers more than their parents and may begin to criticise their parents’ Islamic faith, according to Byler.\u0026nbsp“The students, children, might question them and say, you know, this is backward, this is extremist,” he said.\u0026nbspThe Kashgar notice also said schools being modified to house students should place no more than 24 beds in one room – an indication of the programme’s size. In 2015, a sprawling new boarding school complex was completed on the outskirts of Kashgar, with the capacity to house 23,400 students and teachers, according to the state-run China Daily.\u0026nbspAbdurehim Imin, a writer from Kashgar, said a friend told him his 14-year-old daughter had been sent to a bilingual school in 2015 after his wife was arrested, ostensibly for receiving a gift of olive oil he sent her. When reporters visited what appeared to be his daughter’s school, Peyzawat County No 4 High School, a local plainclothes officer who identified herself as Gu Li said it was a bilingual boarding school. She said that while Uighur students had to study Mandarin, there were also Han Chinese students studying Uighur.\u0026nbspYet the exterior of the school bore bright red lettering that said: “Please speak Mandarin upon entering the schoolyard”. Barbed wire around the campus extended for miles, with rows of tall apartment buildings marked as dormitories.\u0026nbspA historian at the University of Sydney, David Brophy, said the move towards boarding schools brought to mind Aboriginal children in Australia who were forcibly separated from their families in the 1900s and placed into state-run institutions that discouraged indigenous identity.\u0026nbsp“Should China’s policies continue in this direction, we may be talking about a Chinese version of the Stolen Generation,” he said.Since coming to Istanbul by himself in 2014, 42-year-old Imin, the writer, has led a solitary existence in a dimly lit apartment with bare walls and stacks of writings. For the first year, he avoided looking at photos of his children.\u0026nbsp“We are dying every day,” Imin said. “We cannot see our kids, we cannot see our parents. This is an eternal torture.”\u0026nbspIn December, he was sent a photo of his daughter wearing a traditional Chinese “qipao”. He deleted the picture because he could not bear to look at it, he said, and could not sleep for nearly a month.\u0026nbspImin also has four other children in Xinjiang. Last summer, a friend who had visited his home in Kashgar told Imin that two of them had been killed in a traffic accident while his wife was in prison. He does not know where the other two are.\u0026nbspFeeling helpless, he wrote verse after verse in mourning:\u0026nbsp“I will go... to tear down your dark, endless night ...\u0026nbspI will go, to embrace again my hometown ...\u0026nbspI will go, bearing my sorrow to your tomb.”\u0026nbspElsewhere in Istanbul, Meripet’s house was quiet during Eid al-Adha, a Muslim holy festival heralded by large family reunions. In a room at the end of the hall, there rose the distant laughter of relatives’ children.\u0026nbspShe flipped through the photographs she keeps in her purse: Abdurahman, the oldest Adile, her only daughter and her two younger sons, Muhemmed and Abdulla. Meripet has a fifth child, a son named Abduweli who was born in Turkey. She calls him “my only light”.\u0026nbsp“Sometimes I wonder if I will go crazy from this pain,” she says. “I have only been able to keep living because I know there is hope – I know one day I will see my children again.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/20/14/yinchuan.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/20/14/yinchuan.jpg","title":"maldives election president yameen defeat china india opposition government","story":"Created with Sketch.Island nation has huge strategic significance for regional powers, and victory for opposition leader\u0026nbspIbrahim Mohamed Solih\u0026nbspcould prove a blow to China\u0027s ambitionsClick to followThe IndependentMales election: Pro-China President Yameen concedes shock defeat as rival India celebrates \u0027triumph of democracy\u0027The Males\u0027 strongman president Yameen Abdul Gayoom\u0026nbsphas unexpectedly conceded\u0026nbspdefeat in a general\u0026nbspelection that many international observers had feared would\u0026nbspbe rigged in the incumbent\u0027s favour.India and the US congratulated the Males on conducting a peaceful democratic transition, after the vote was snubbed by\u0026nbspbodies including the European Union for failing to meet the basic conditions for monitoring.At a news conference televised live from the capital, Male, Mr Yameen\u0026nbspadmitted defeat, saying: I know I have to step down now.\u0026nbspThe result hands a surprise victory to opposition leader\u0026nbspIbrahim Mohamed Solih​, and could have major significance for the wider region as China and India vie\u0026nbspfor influence in the strategic island nation.President Yameen\u0026nbspcultivated close ties with Beijing and drew criticism from New Delhi for his authoritarian tactics, cracking\u0026nbspdown on political dissent while jailing rivals and Supreme Court justices.Mr Solih\u0026nbspand his opposition alliance had dismissed Sunday\u0027s vote, with a turnout of almost 90 per cent, as unfair - right up to the point when they were declared winners by the Males Election Commission.The commission\u0027s preliminary results\u0026nbspshowed Mr Solih with 134,616 votes and the incumbent Mr Yameen on 96,132 votes.\u0026nbspAfter Mr Solih claimed victory just after midnight on Monday, his supporters flooded the streets, hugging one another, waving the Malian flag, cheering and honking horns in celebration.\u0026nbspMr Solih, 56, was a democracy activist during decades of autocratic rule and a former Parliament majority leader. He became the Malian Democratic Party\u0027s presidential candidate after its other top figures were jailed or exiled by the Yameen\u0026nbspadministration.Rising seas could make many islands uninhabitable within decadesMale’s President orders state of emergency to investigate ‘coup’Will India answer opposition calls to intervene in Males crisis?Relations between the Males and India, one of its main suppliers of imports, reached a nadir under Mr Yameen. When the president declared a state of emergency in February to bypass a Supreme Court order calling for the release of political prisoners, there was speculation that India could intervene militarily to throw Mr Yameen\u0026nbspout.India\u0027s foreign ministry said Sunday\u0027s election result marked\u0026nbspnot only the triumph of democratic forces in the Males, but also... the firm commitment to the values of democracy and the rule of law.\u0026nbspIt said India looked forward to working with Mr Solih\u0027s new government in further deepening our relationship.Although Mr Yameen\u0027s\u0026nbspgovernment was criticised over rights and freedoms, the\u0026nbspMales\u0027 economy - traditionally reliant on tourism to its many islands - did grow in recent years. Economists largely put that down to Chinese aid and\u0026nbspinfrastructure development.Indrani Bagchi, a leading commentator and\u0026nbspTimes of India diplomatic editor, said the Males under Mr Solih\u0026nbspwill continue to have close ties with China, not least because of the debt and the demand of infrastructure which India is quite poor at.China won’t go away, she said.\u0026nbspBut India is back in the game.Times of IndiaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/1021643_1.jpg","title":"brexit labour second referendum baking people s vote iain dale LBC","story":"Political commentator Mr Dale made the damning claim to his 119,000 Twitter followers today following news Mr Corbyn has backtracked on a previous vow his party would not back a second Brexit referendum today and has now said he would if Labour wanted it.Furious LBC presenter Mr Dale also said Mr Corbyn\u0027s shift in supporting calls for a final say on Mrs May\u0026rsquos Brexit deal would \u0026ldquoalmost guarantee they lose the next election.Mr Dale said: \u0026ldquoIf Labour bows to middle class liberal elites\u0027 demands for a second referendum (because they\u0027re the only ones who want one), they thereby insult the millions of Labour voters who knew exactly what they voted for in June 2016.\u0026ldquoAnd almost guarantee they lose the next election.His tweet sparked a flurry of comments from his followers.One said: \u0026ldquoIain, you\u0026rsquore better than this.

In 1962 London Bridge was falling down.\u0026nbspThe stone crossing was built in an era before modern traffic and the whole construction was slowly but surely sinking into the Thames.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp                Two missing and 13 injured as US boats collide on Colorado RiverThe only answer was to tear it down and build a new bridge \u0026ndash and so the City of London looked around for a buyer.A glossy 40-page brochure was produced, along with TV ads offering the bridge as a unique piece of British history.\u0026nbspAt the same time, 5,000 miles away, millionaire entrepreneur Robert Paxton McCulloch was looking for a gimmick to promote his latest project.\u0026nbspIn 1958 he had purchased 3,353 acres of land in the Arizona desert by Lake Havasu, with the idea of building a new city from scratch.\u0026nbspFour years later he acquired another 13,000 acres and in 1963 Lake Havasu City was formally established.\u0026nbspIt may have been called a city but the place was still a backwater in the middle of nowhere.\u0026nbspThe population had stalled at barely 2,000 and, due to its remoteness and arid climate, seemed to have no prospect of growing.\u0026nbspBut it was while on a trip to London that McCulloch was to have the idea that would transform Lake Havasu.\u0026nbspHearing that London Bridge was up for sale, he approached the City and asked how much it would cost to buy the bridge, take it apart, ship it to Arizona and then painstakingly reassemble it in the desert.\u0026nbspBob McCulloch  (Image: S\u0026ampG and Barratts EMPICS Archive)The quote: \u0026pound1.78million \u0026ndash plus another \u0026pound5.3million in shipping costs.\u0026nbspOn April 18, 1968, the deal was done.\u0026nbspEvery one of the bridge\u0026rsquos huge granite blocks was inidually numbered, indexed and charted on detailed sectional plans and, along with every lamp standard, parapet and arch, loaded on to ships and transported across the Atlantic to Arizona.\u0026nbspThe venture made international headlines.\u0026nbspTo spend so much money moving a granite bridge across an ocean and then overland to a tiny desert community seemed crazy.\u0026nbspRumours abounded that McCulloch had lost his mind\u0026hellip and even that he had bought the wrong bridge, thinking he had got Tower Bridge.\u0026nbspFor McCulloch himself, however, every rumour was golden: Lake Havasu City was suddenly the subject of headlines around the world.\u0026nbspAnd so, far from quashing the gossip that he was insane, or the victim of a con trick, he let the rumours and the jokes continue.\u0026nbspRedford and son make Colorado River documentaryHunter rescued from icy US riverREVEALED: Pilots FINALLY speak out about UFO sighting in Arizona He had bought London Bridge as a publicity stunt \u0026ndash and publicity was precisely what he was getting.\u0026nbspExactly 50 years ago yesterday the cornerstone of London Bridge was laid on the desert sand of Lake Havasu City by Sir Gilbert Inglefield, Lord Mayor of London, and work began on its meticulous reconstruction.\u0026nbspLake Havasu resident Bobbi Holmes remembers watching the structure being assembled as a schoolgirl.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe didn\u0026rsquot need a bridge, she says.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe thought it was hilarious, we thought it was a joke.\u0026nbspQuite apart from the absurdity of buying, transporting and rebuilding London Bridge in the first place, McCulloch had done so without having an actual river for the bridge to cross.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoMost people build bridges to cross a river, she says.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoMcCulloch built a river under a bridge.\u0026nbspFoundation stone layed by Lord Mayor of London (Image: Popperfoto Getty Images)The plan was to build the bridge on dry land in a part of the city that jutted out into the lake, and then once it was complete, dredge the sand and rock away from underneath it and create a man-made watercourse, effectively turning the peninsula into an island.\u0026nbspEnvironmental groups initially opposed the idea and McCulloch eventually had to obtain permission to make his own river from the President himself.\u0026nbspEventually on October 10, 1971, the construction was complete, and London Bridge was reopened.\u0026nbspTypically, McCulloch did not do things by halves. As British flags flew, a troop of red-jacketed horsemen paraded through the desert accompanied by pikemen in full 17th-century uniform.\u0026nbspA delegation from London including the Lord Mayor Sir Peter Studd and a host of dignitaries were present as well as a parade featuring other \u0026ldquotypically English attractions including a red phone box, a double-decker bus and a pub selling Yorkshire pudding and roast beef.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspArizona\u0026rsquos art and soul: Scottsdale is alive with architectural gemsArizona plane crash: Flight plunges into golf course in fireballGoogle Maps Street View captures creepy dark road in ArizonaAs the ribbon was cut, 30,000 balloons and 3,000 birds were released into the air, while a plane flew past inscribing the words \u0026ldquoHome at last across the sky with its vapour trail.\u0026nbspAnd, best of all, from McCulloch\u0026rsquos point of view, some 50,000 spectators came to witness the bizarre spectacle. The outrageous plan worked.\u0026nbspLake Havasu was on the map: over the next 10 years the city\u0026rsquos population grew by more than 500 per cent.\u0026nbspSadly McCulloch himself died in 1977 but his extraordinary legacy lives on.\u0026nbspToday, Lake Havasu is a thriving city, and London Bridge attracts 3.65 million visitors a year \u0026ndash Arizona\u0026rsquos third biggest tourist attraction after the Grand Canyon and Glen Canyon National Parks.\u0026nbspNot bad for a spot that didn\u0026rsquot even exist 55 years ago.

This lot are more Bugsy Malone than Al Capone.Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic European Union showed their true colours.This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.But even before the Prime Minister had been the subject of calculated attempts to humiliate her, we saw just how detached from reality Europe’s leaders have become.Maltese and Czech leaders told Britain to hold a second referendum, employing the same tactic that the EU has used in Ireland and Denmark before.This isn’t based on the half-baked “democratic” argument clung to by never-were and past-it grandees at home, such as Andrew Adonis and Lord Heseltine.They just want us to be given the chance to vote the “right” way. Fat chance of that. Throughout this process, the European Union has shown time and time again why more than 17 million people voted to leave.They have refused to negotiate in good faith. They have refused to compromise, even while Britain has worked day-in, day-out to find agreement.They have insulted the Prime Minister, ignored their own citizens, and are willing to accept a massive economic hit for the sake of flexing their muscles.Like all good gangsters, they’re trying to rule by fear. That’s the only weapon in their arsenal on the Continent, where more and more voters are turning against an outfit that increasingly looks more at home in Sicily than Strasbourg.All they have is the chance to punish us, and prove to the rest of the continent that it isn’t worth leaving.The message they want to send? You won’t get away with it.Well, Mrs May is right to say that we’ve nothing to be scared of.Yes, it is without doubt that we need to pick up the pace on preparations for a clean-break Brexit.It is vital we show the European Union, who still seem to think we’ll roll over when it really matters, that we are ready for a new future free of their cold, dead hands.And despite no-marks such as Donald Tusk trolling the PM on Instagram, and the puffed-up pomposity of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, we haven’t entirely given up hope that sensible forces within the EU might find their voice in the crucial months to come — and work with the UK, not against it.The Government should be all ears  Brussels makes us an offer that works for both sides.But after yesterday’s performance, we don’t hold out much hope.Brussels has made us an offer it thinks we can’t refuse.Today we join the Prime Minister in saying no.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He sets the timetable and makes decisions over which engines should be scrapped. The problem with today’s railway ­system is that there is nobody who takes on the role.That was made clear in the report by Professor Stephen Glaister, the chairman of the Office Of Rail And Road, into the chaos that paralysed the railways in May following an extensive timetable change.In a logical world, you might think, dear rail passenger, that Chris Grayling, the Secretary Of State For Transport, is the man in charge. After all, he is the one who pops up on TV when there is good news to announce, such as the opening of a refurbished ­station or the introduction of new trains, but you would be wrong.Grayling refuses to take responsibility, recently telling a Parliamentary committee that “I don’t run the railways”. Yet his civil servants in the Department interfere with the railways all the time. They make decisions over what ­services should be run, the fares to be charged, what new trains should be bought and which private company should operate them.Prof Glaister’s report makes clear that Grayling was deeply involved in making the decision to go ahead with the timetable changes, even though the ­industry was not prepared for them. If Grayling was not in charge, then he should have made sure that someone else was — but failed to do so.It’s clear from the report no one has overall responsibility for the ­railways, and that’s why they are in such a mess.Prof Glaister’s report highlights the fact that the railways were simply not ready to cope with the wholesale ­timetable changes, which were focused around ­services through London on the Thameslink lines and across the North, and ­overall affected nearly half — 46 per cent — of trains on the whole network.The report shows that the railway ­simply could not cope. The changes brought the service to its knees, resulting in thousands of services being ­cancelled and countless others delayed. Many passengers in May were left standing at stations for hours as ­successive trains failed to turn up.On one branch line in the Lake District, services were cancelled entirely and temporarily replaced by a diesel-hauled heritage train — which proved to be more popular than the usual service, especially as it was free.The introduction of the timetable resulted in the worst performance of the railways in more than a decade, with one in eight trains running late during this period. The after-effects are still being felt today, with daily cancellations and delays, and it will be several months before things are back to normal.Prof Glaister does not mince his words and found every part of the industry wanting. Network Rail, which is responsible for drawing up the timetable, “did not take any action” back in the autumn when it was clear there would be trouble ­implementing the new schedules.Two train operators, Govia Thameslink and Northern, “were not sufficiently aware” of the problems and failed to inform passengers when disruption ­occurred, while the Department For Transport and the Office Of Rail And Road itself watched these events unfold without doing anything or questioning whether the introduction of the timetable should be postponed.The irony is that the timetable changes were introduced to increase the number of trains available to commuters. In ­particular, in the North, the opening of the new Ordsall Chord linking ­Manchester’s two main railway stations was designed to improve services in the region.However, because Network Rail failed to ensure that more platforms were built at the biggest station, Piccadilly, rather than improvements for local passengers the result has been longer delays and ­numerous cancellations.That is precisely the sort of lack of co-ordination which happens because ­British Rail was broken up on its privatisation in the 1990s into more than 100 companies. Passengers are paying the price for that mistake today.The biggest error was to separate the services, run by companies including ­Virgin and Arriva, from the infrastructure, which is in the hands of Network Rail , when, in fact, the railways run much better as a single entity.Ironically, the Prime Minister at the time, John Major, had wanted the railway to be sold off as just four or five large companies that ran services and were responsible for the tracks and stations, but he was overruled by the Treasury, which wanted competition between ­companies — something that has simply not happened.As a result of the timetable chaos and other recent problems on the railways, such as the failure of the East Coast franchise and overspending on ­electrication schemes by Network Rail, Grayling has launched an inquiry into the state of the railways. It is the fourth such inquiry in the past decade and the others have largely been ignored.This time there is an obvious and clear solution. Create an organisation ­independent of the duffers in Whitehall who keep on interfering with the railways, and make sure it is headed by a Fat ­Controller who has power to make ­decisions over the whole railway, ­including the timetable, investment plans and ­services.Inevitably, this will at first have to be a publicly-owned body, since Network Rail is currently owned by the Government.But to appease any Tories opposed to renationalisation, Grayling could say that eventually it might be privatised — though given the experience of the crisis-ridden past 20 years, that day may well be a long time off.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The EU know this Government didn’t start properly planning for no deal until this summer.Senior figures there believe the UK will back down rather than go down a route it is so ill-prepared for.So Mrs May is trying to, publicly, burn her boats on the beach.To show that she can’t accept membership of the European Economic Area and the customs union, which would leave the UK as essentially a non-voting member of the EU, or the current Irish backstop, which would see Northern Ireland kept in the EU’s customs union even as the rest of the UK leaves it.One Downing Street source tells me all European leaders say they want an agreement.But a deal isn’t compatible with their Irish backstop proposal. So they’ll have to choose.If the EU doesn’t show any sign of moving in the next fortnight, Mrs May will come under real pressure to change tack from Chequers from her own Cabinet.“The problem is the Cabinet ministers who backed it on the grounds that it was doable,” one Secretary of State tells me. .A growing number of Cabinet ministers think that with the EU rejecting Chequers, Mrs May should turn to a more Canada-style approach — pushing for the free trade deal the EU has repeatedly said is on offer.“There’s an opportunity amid the embarrassment,” one member of this group tells me.No10 rejects this argument, saying a Canada-style deal doesn’t solve the Irish backstop problem.But these ministers think by moving away from Chequers, the UK could create the space for a compromise on the Irish border.Another problem is how blindsided No10 was by the Salzburg snub.This will make it harder for Downing Street to persuade ministers to trust its judgment on what compromises need to be made to get a deal.For instance, Olly Robbins, the PM’s chief Europe adviser, wants us to commit to matching EU social and environmental regulations as well as product regulations.This is meant to deal with one of the EU’s objections to Chequers, that the UK could gain a competitive advantage by not following every new EU rule in these fields.But several key ministers have objections to this.They are now less likely to accept this compromise because they are far more sceptical of Robbins’ reading of the state of the negotiations.In the coming weeks, the Cabinet will become more and more assertive.They won’t all be pushing for the same thing — there are those who would prefer a customs union to a Canada-style deal — but they will demand greater input.For they nearly all worry about no deal.One Government source tells me: “We all know what no deal looks like, you can’t blunder into that.”What Mrs May must do in the coming weeks is give herself room for manoeuvre between no deal and signing up to a customs union.She is trying to do that by shocking the EU into engaging with Chequers.But  the EU won’t, then several key Cabinet ministers will push for a new approach ahead of the October EU Council.THERESA MAY has set up a small, kitchen Cabinet to consult on Brexit policy.It met in the first week of September and again on Tuesday this week.This new Cabinet grouping essentially replaces the Brexit inner Cabinet.Mrs May cooled on this Brexit inner Cabinet, which was designed to be balanced between those who campaigned for Brexit and those who had backed Remain, after it objected to her preferred customs plan.I understand that Philip Hammond forcibly made the point that such a balanced committee constrained her options.Those attending this meeting include the increasingly influential David Lidington, Chancellor Philip Hammond, the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, the chief whip Julian Smith and the Prime Minister’s chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who has taken charge of the mission of selling Chequers.In Whitehall, this new group has been dubbed “The Chequers Defence Committee” because of how much of its time is taken up with working out how to sell the Prime Minister’s Brexit proposals.The first meeting included a discussion of whether, and how, ministers should respond to Boris Johnson’s broadsides against Mrs May’s plan.The discussions have also revealed something about Mrs May’s relationship with her own MPs.It was agreed that the PM would meet with a series of Labour Brexiteers – Gisela Stuart, Frank Field and Kate Hoey – in the hope that they might be able to persuade some of her MPs to back her approach.This is quite extraordinary: A PM trying to get opposition figures to persuade her own party to back her plans.CABINET will meet on Monday to discuss Britain’s post-Brexit immigration policy.This is one of the most important decisions this Government will take.So it is absurd that, on Friday lunchtime, ministers still did not have the papers for the meeting.I understand, though, that the Government’s intention is to come up with a system that does not discriminate between EU nationals and those from the rest of the world.However, the UK will be prepared to discuss immigration as part of a trade deal. But this arrangement will not be free movement.Earlier this month, Mrs May told her closest Cabinet colleagues that this is one of the issues she is determined not to compromise on.What is required is an immigration system that encourages the best and the brightest to come here and ensures this country has the workers it needs.I UNDERSTAND there was a plan for Jeremy Corbyn to attend today’s Liverpool match against Southampton ahead of Labour’s conference in the city.But the club didn’t want him on the pitch, so Corbyn won’t get to score at the Kop end.Labour deny that there was any plan for Corbyn to go on to the pitch.IF No10 didn’t have enough to worry about ahead of Tory conference, there is the issue of Theresa May’s voice.She can ill afford a repeat of last year, when it kept giving out during the speech.In an attempt to prevent this from happening, her schedule will be pared right back. Mrs May will do some events designed to encourage more women into politics.But Cabinet Ministers will fill in for her at the ious regional receptions to try to save her voice.Mrs May’s voice isn’t No10’s only concern.One Cabinet minister tells me: “They are completely paranoid she is going to get slow hand-clapped.”This fear strikes me as misplaced.Activists who remember the agony of last year’s conference speech will give her credit for standing up and doing it all over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it.We CANNOT keep making sacrices and proposing solutions only for Brussels to reject them without any sensible counter offer. That’s not a negotiation.So, as Mrs May says, it’s stalemate. If, as The Sun expects, their response is more of the same, she should tell them this: “Here’s one final offer... not Chequers, but a simple free trade deal, plus security co-operation, that respects our referendum and your principles.“And since Michel Barnier now accepts that technology CAN police borders, let’s use it between Northern Ireland and Ireland.” If they spurn that, we’ll know they aren’t serious.We can leave with no deal, bank our £39billion orce payment and mitigate short-term damage by slashing taxes.We will lure businesses and talent from the continent and embrace those already here, as Mrs May has promised.And we will be free from the clutches of the Brussels club and the posturing pygmies running it.IS anyone more delusional or dishonest than the laughably-named People’s Vote campaign?These Remainiac losers pretend a second referendum is in the nation’s interests when it plainly only serves theirs.To get their way they would risk hideous disorder and the annihilation of trust in democracy. And they are utterly deluded about their chances of victory.Almost all Leavers would vote the same way, alongside many ex-Remainers who know the first vote must be honoured and now see the EU for what it truly is, especially after Thursday.But even  Remain won, why should anyone respect THEIR victory?It would never be sustainable. The fury at an EU which bullied us into a rerun would never subside. Nor would the rage at Remain diehards who ­colluded with Brussels to bring it about.The genie is out of the bottle.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Gone,  was the mantra that there is no alternative to the Chequers proposal, which so angered all of us who have campaigned for Brexit.Yet instead, two things emerged. The first that the Prime Minister was clearly angered by their treatment of her.Regardless of their views on Chequers, she has the right to believe that as the UK has always treated the EU with respect, so EU leaders should show the UK the same respect in .Second is what I and others have been saying, that the best and most workable relationship after we leave is one based on a comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and the EU.However,  we are to reach such an agreement, the EU must recognise that they will have to get rid of the demands for a Northern Irish border backstop, which blocks such a deal.The EU demand that either the UK as a whole stay in the Customs Union or that Northern Ireland is separated from the UK by a customs border is unacceptable and would harm our Union.In fact, a recent publication by two ex-Secretaries of State for Northern Ireland shows that there does not need to be a “hard” border with checkpoints or gates, and instead we could have a practical solution where goods flow freely between Ireland and Northern Ireland.In fact, such a system should be employed at all our borders around the UK, as this would greatly reduce the likelihood of customs problems at ports from Zeebrugge to Calais.So after months of manoeuvring, and poor advice from advisers in No10, now the choice is at least — and at last — crystal clear.The UK wants a comprehensive trade deal with the EU but they need to cease demands about the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland.Failing that, the UK will leave under terms which govern trade between nations around the world.No trade deal is better than a bad trade deal, so the ball is firmly in the EU’s court.By Priti Patel, Tory former Cabinet ministerOUTRAGEOUS, insulting and immature sums up the EU’s appalling behaviour to the UK and to our Prime Minister.These shenanigans from an out-of-touch EU elite serve to demonstrate why Britain was right to vote leave.Who wants to remain in a club where its senior unelected figures mock our great and proud country and shamefully ambush our PM?Not only has Britain bankrolled the EU for the past 45 years, the freedoms and liberties enjoyed by the Continent have been secured by our Armed Forces and the sacrices Britain made in two world wars.While we want to maintain strong, friendly and cordial relations with our friends and partners in Europe, Donald Tusk belittles the PM on social media and President Macron brands those who back Brexit as “liars”.Macron’s undiplomatic comments are an insult not only to the 17.4million people who backed Brexit but to the entire country.Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge.The British people deserve better than the EU humiliating and insulting us.We are a proud nation and will not stand for a Government that surrenders to unreasonable demands from Europe’s unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats. This Government has already gone too far, with Chequers offering the EU control over large parts of our law-making.The sad fact about the position the Government is now in is that it was advised to “chuck Chequers” and pursue an alternative course of free and open trade.However, this is not the moment to cower and compromise further.Salzburg should mark the moment when we decide as a country to press ahead with taking back full control over our destiny.Our generous overtures of a £40billion orce payment, remaining an EU rule taker and compromise have been spurned and the EU is resorting to insults.So it’s time the Government realised this and “got real” on Brexit.Britain must take back control of these negotiations and send the EU a signal it will understand loud and clear.We must take the £40billion off the table and remind the EU there are serious consequences to their appalling behaviour and this will hit them hard.If they want to negotiate then we should offer them a take-it-or-leave-it, Canada-plus-style free trade deal, which is an economic prize for the UK and our trading partners.We leave the EU in six months and instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain and let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the journal, the team wrote: “Through high-precision airborne measurements and atmospheric dispersion modelling, we show that Katla, a highly hazardous subglacial volcano which last erupted 100 years ago, is one of the largest volcanic sources of CO2 on Earth, releasing up to five per cent of total global volcanic emissions.”Sarah Barsotti, co-ordinator for volcanic hazards at the Icelandic Meteorological Office, said: “There is no way of telling when it will erupt, just that it will.”Of its past ten eruptions, eight took place between September and November - when its thought glacial melting creates the necessary conditions for magma to burst forth.It is this glacial ice – hundreds of metres thick – that most worries locals.Should such an explosion happen, the ice covering the volcano will melt, flooding the surrounding areas so severely that authorities have plans in place to evacuate Iceland’s entire southern coast.Evgenia Ilyinskaya, a research fellow in the Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics at Leeds University, told RUV, the Icelandic national broadcasting service, that the volume of CO2 indicated something signicant.She said: “There must also be a magma build-up to release this quantity of gas.“It is well known from other volcanoes, for example in Hawaii and Alaska, that CO2 emissions increase weeks or years ahead of eruptions. “This is a clear sign we need to keep a close eye on Katla. She isn’t just doing nothing, and these findings confirm that there is something going on.”Ilyinskaya and her team did sound a not of caution that more studies were needed to confirm whether the amount of magma was increasing over time. But another volcanologist, Magnus Tumi Gudmundsson, professor of geophysics at the University of Iceland, was more skeptical about the eruption fears.The prof argued more research was needed to say whether the emissions were growing or they were normal. On his department Facebook, he said Katla could act as an exhaust vent for gases released deep in Iceland’s southern volcanic belt and that emissions could also be cyclical, unconnected to any unusual activity."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000433539498.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit secretary dominic raab computer says no","story":"The Brexit Secretary attacked EU leaders for refusing to show enough imagination to strike a win-win deal - as he doubled down on Theresa May’s negotiating strategy.Mr Raab dismissed recent turmoil in Brexit talks as “a bump in the road” and insisted the PM won’t abandon her Chequers proposals.Speaking after the Salzburg summit where European leaders shot down Mrs May’s plans, the Brexit Secretary told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show today: “It’s clear a change was made very late on by the EU in their response.This is a bump in the road - we will hold our nerve, we will keep our cool and we will keep negotiating in good faith.What we are not going to do is be dictated to.

One offended veteran is one too many on this hallowed day.”The secret plan to invite Mr Steinmeier was uncovered by a Sun photographer who snapped officials on Friday as they headed into 10 Downing Street carrying briefing papers.Visible among the papers was an email that raised fears of an outcry.It read: “I am aware advice has previously been submitted to No 10 and a view taken that, on balance, German involvement should be focussed to the Westminster Abbey service, given the Cenotaph is about remembering those affected by all wars/conflicts rather than just WW1.“I would welcome a fresh look at this, especially an assessment of the potential concerns from veterans associations and the risk of negative Press coverage.”The Royal British Legion said: “This is an especially poignant year as we mark the end of the First World War Centenary.However, Field Marshal Lord Guthrie, ex-head of the Armed Forces, said of a German invite: “It’s unnecessary, quite honestly.“There are other ways of healing wounds but this is a peculiarly British and Commonwealth occasion remembering our dead.”“As a champion of Remembrance, The Royal British Legion promotes the message of reconciliation after conflict and hope for a peaceful future, and we encourage the nation to embrace these core principles.”GOT a story?

Until now, Jezza — a staunch Bennite eurosceptic — has resisted any move to overturn Brexit. Yesterday, in a remarkable U-turn, he vowed to accept whatever delegates say.So abject surrender to the mob is the price he will pay to destroy Theresa May. “I enjoy being leader,” he said yesterday. “I am carrying on as leader of the Labour Party because I want to win an election.”His persistence in the face of scathing personal ratings is the only glint of sunlight for stricken Tories.Under any other leader, even snooty wannabe Emily Thornberry, Labour would be miles ahead.But we have learned not to underestimate Corbyn.The People’s Vote movement probably has the numbers in Parliament to vote down any deal Mrs May brings back from Brussels.These so-called “moderates”, including the slippery Peter Mandelson, leadership flop David Miliband and decrepit Vince Cable, should be careful what they wish for.In normal times, the Tories would beat off the Momentum marauders. But for all her brave talk in Downing Street last week, Mrs May is a real political liability.She destroyed both her credibility and her majority in last year’s unforced contest.The public mood on Brexit is volatile and unpredictable.Most people believe the majority for Brexit, fuelled by EU arrogance and plain bad manners, could actually grow. But nobody’s sure.A snap election would focus the public’s attention on the choice between a clean break and a botched compromise which will never be acceptable to all sides.It could cauterise the issue which still ides families and friends. Or it could backfire badly.Tory Brexiteers must think hard before pulling the plug on the Maybot. It could split their party asunder.But so could Jeremy Corbyn’s rank opportunism.Blairite Labour moderates must soon choose.If they help Jeremy Corbyn win a vote of no confidence, what do they do next?Will they campaign for a party whose rampant extremists wish them dead? Will they stay silent while Momentum activists unseat their moderate comrades?Can deputy Tom Watson support a leader whose own MPs need round-the-clock armed guards against his dangerously fanatical supporters?Can they ignore threats of rape and torture? Nothing is too extreme or too petty for these thugs. They even want ex-Labour luvvie Maureen Lipman sacked from Corrie for attacking their Beloved Leader.Anyone who thinks images of Marxist anarchy are far-fetched should listen to Corbyn sidekick Dawn Butler praising the 1980s Militant Tendency — the forerunner to Momentum — which almost bankrupted Merseyside.“We are in Liverpool where over 30 years ago the council stood up to Thatcher and said, better to break the law than break the poor,” she ranted.That was when Labour split asunder for the first time, creating a new Social Democrat party which posed a short-lived threat the Tories.Roy Hattersley, deputy leader in those turbulent times, warns the party could split again today. “All we need is for one of the hard-working, long-suffering MPs to be kicked out and the whole thing will blow up in our faces,” he said yesterday.The Tories just need to be patient.Albanian drug gangs are gaining market share from Bulgarians, Romanians and Colombians by slashing cocaine prices.Police arrested a record 4,000 peddlers operating across county lines, mostly too young to charge.Kne crime among Somalis, Eritreans and Nigerians is soaring.Meanwhile, there’s a growth spurt in modern slavery.Organised crime is a multi-billion-pound industry affecting “more UK citizens, more often, than any other national security threat,” says the National Crime Agency.All despite Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Deal, or no dough.LABOUR’S position on Brexit is clear as mud, but we know one thing they do believe: the Press needs muzzling.From the moment Jeremy Corbyn told us that “change is coming”, the media has come under attack after attack from a leader who is playing the man — not the ball — when it comes to those asking him legitimate questions.Union strongman Len McCluskey accused the media of “vicious attacks” on the Labour Party.But it’s not an “attack” to ask Corbyn, a man who wants to be PM, why he spent his holidays visiting a terrorists’ cemetery in Tunisia or why he invited the IRA for tea and treats in Parliament.Nor is it just the tactics of the hated “mainstream media” to ask John McDonnell whether his extremist economics will actually work in the real world..Today’s announcement on employee ownership appears appealing for workers, but it would only hit investment and productivity in the long-term.If this Labour Party gains power, the free Press — and the economy — would be in serious danger.IS Anthony Joshua now the UK’s most impressive sportsman?His win over Alexander Povetkin at a packed-out Wembley was stunning.It’s now on to Fury and Wilder.Beat those two, and he might go down as Britain’s best ever boxer.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK is one of the biggest economies in Europe,  not in the world.”And he blasted Brussels for ignoring the will of voters with their hardline Brexit stance, warning it would give rise to extremists.He told The BBC: “The EU has a habit of spurning democratic votes, whether in referendums in this country, and they’re trying to do that to some degree, or across the rest of the EU.“One of the things that really does give rise to extremism and fringe politics, and the anti-elitism which we’re seeing fuelling populist movements across continental Europe is this idea that when the people have their say, they’re sent back to the drawing board.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will respect the referendum.”Speaking to ITVs Good Morning Britain, he added: It will be about whether you accept the deal or not or whether you send people back to negotiate a proper deal.And he told BBC Radio 5 Live: My big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  its slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.Yesterday Mr Corbyn’s biggest union backer Len McCluskey said any fresh referendum should offer a choice between the PMs Chequers plan and No Deal.The Shadow Chancellor’s comments sparked further unrest from Labour MPs and activists who are keen to overturn Brexit altogether.Tottenham MP David Lammy blasted: Dozens of motions were submitted to #Lab18, thousands have marched on the streets, and millions more have called for a #PeoplesVote.They did not do this to be offered a farcical referendum on No Deal or a Bad Deal. It absolutely must include the right to remain in the EU.Chris Leslie added: Labour supporters overwhelmingly want a #PeoplesVote. This is not a time for s and buts and caveats. Let’s get on with it.And Lib Dem MP Tom Brake said: It beggars belief that McDonnell and co are spending so much time trying to trick and stitch up their own conference, rather than campaigning for an exit from Brexit to protect jobs and services in the UK.“The only choice a ‘deal or no deal’ vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at.A poll carried out shortly before Labour conference found that an overwhelming majority of party members support a second referendum which could keep Britain in the EU.Both Mr Corbyn and his deputy Tom Watson have said they would accept the verdict of members  they voted to back a re-run of the 2016 vote.The party backed Remain during the 2016 referendum, but the day after the vote Jeremy Corbyn called on the Government to trigger the Article 50 process immediately.In last year’s election, Labour suggested they wanted to quit the EU customs union and single market - in an echo of the Tories’ policy.But in the year since the party has taken a much softer line and is now officially in favour of staying IN the customs union.Many backbench MPs and grassroots activists want Labour to go even further and come out in support of a second referendum.The fudge announced today is an attempt to keep both sides happy - by saying the party is likely to back a new Brexit referendum, but it wouldn’t include an option to stay in the EU.The party’s dilemma is that last year it picked up millions of votes from young Remainers who have turned against the Tories because of Brexit.But  Labour take an overly pro-EU line they risk alienating older working-class voters who have backed the party all their lives but voted for Brexit in 2016."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423694380.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"flight mh370 final moments revealed documentary","story":"National Geographic’s Drain The Oceans, which explores a “handful of clues” about the jet’s disappearance, suggests the plane ran out of fuel before hitting the water with considerable force.The Malaysian Airlines flight vanished en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumper on March 8, 2014.Perth-based Electric Pictures worked closely with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and the official government investigation team on the Nat Geo episode.A never-before-seen reconstruction of the jets final moments claims the plane continued to exchange signals with a satellite, known as Inmarsat, above the Indian Ocean, despite being lost to radar.The signals occurred once an hour and experts were able to use this to calculate its direction of travel.They established that after its initial track to the northwest, MH370 turned south and flew for six more hours.Further analysis of the Inmar satellite showed that in its final moments the plane descended rapidly, almost certainly because it ran out of fuel.Engineers then conducted a simulation of what happens when a Boeing 777 runs out of fuel, making it possible to recreate the final moments of the mysterious flight.According to Drain The Oceans, the right engine flamed out first, the autopilot compensated for the imbalance with a hard left turn, then the second engine flamed out minutes later.With no power, the autopilot shut down, leaving MH370 in a “long spiral descent”.Debris which has been found in the western Indian Ocean reveals clues as to how the plane plunged into the water.At a remote island, almost 5000km from search area, a piece of metal had washed up on the beach of Reunion Island.It was a flaperon from the wing of a plane, and Boeing confirmed the serial number matched that of MH370.Vladimir PutinSome feared Russian president Vladimir Putin was involved in the hijacking of MH370.US Science writer Jeff Wise claimed Putin spoofed the planes navigation data so it could fly unnoticed into Baikonur Cosmodrome so he could hurt the West.US shootoutFrench ex-airline director Marc Dugain accused the US military of shooting down the plane because they feared it had been hijacked.SuicideMalaysia police chief Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar suggested the disappearance could have been the result of a suicide.He claimed someone on board could have taken out a large le insurance package before getting on the plane, so they could treat their family or pay back the money they owed.In hiding?Historian and writer Norman Davies suggested MH370 could have been remotely hacked and flown to a secret location as a result of sensitive material being carried aboard the jet.Cracks in the planeMalaysia Airlines found a 15-inch crack in the fuselage of one of its planes, days before MH370 disappeared.The Federal Aviation Administration insists it issued a final warning two days before the disappearance.But the Daily Mirror claimed the missing jet did not have the same antenna as the rest of the Boeing 777s so it did not receive the warning.Pilot planned the incidentAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull unexpectedly said it was “very likely that the captain planned this shocking event”.He claimed the pilot wanted to create the worlds greatest mystery.Another theory claimed that he hijacked his own plane in protest of the jailing of then-Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and as a way to destabilise the corrupt government of Najib Razak.North Korea took the planeIn the wake of the incident, South Korea noted that North Korea nearly took out a Chinese plane which had 220 passengers on board, on March 5, 2014.Some fear Pyongyang shot the plane down, but others believe it was hijacked and erted into the communist nation.This is where amateur wreck hunter Blaine Gibson comes in. He travelled to Mozambique where he located a triangular piece of wreckage with the words “no step” on it, 7,000km from the main search zone.Boeing confirmed it was also from the plane.Mr Gibson kept searching on the western side of the Indian Ocean and found 15 more pieces of wreckage.He said the most signicant discovery was the case that sits around the TV screen on the back of seats.“This is the one  that brought tears to my eyes,” Mr Gibson said.“This is perhaps the last thing that somebody saw, this is what anyone who flies on a plane would recognise.”This kind of debris, from inside the cabin, confirmed the plane hit the water with force.ATSB crash investigator Peter Foley said: “Some of the items indicate there was quite a large amount of energy at the time the aircraft entered the water.”The first official £112.5million search for MH370 launched by Australia, China and Malaysia ended in January 2017.Investigators released a final report which said they were unable to determine what happened to the plane.In July, 2018, the Malaysian government claimed the plane was under manual control when it deliberately turned off course, before plunging into the Indian Ocean, killing 239 people.A version of this article originally appeared on News.au."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000436441672.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960\" height=\"720\" width=\"960","title":"indonesian teenager survives 49 days at sea fishing hut","story":"Aldi Novel Adilang, from Sulawesi, an Indonesian island east of Borneo, was left drting after his mooring cable snapped off in a storm in July.The 19-year-old had been working 77 miles out at sea in the Bay of Manado as a lamp keeper which involved operating lights that attracted fish to a floating trap, known as a rompong, when it was set adrt.The teenager only had a few days’ worth of food and water and the vessel had no engine or paddle.Incredibly, he survived by catching fish and then burning wood from his hut to cook them.Seawater was drunk through his clothes to minimise the amount of salt ingested.While marooned, the Indonesian consulate in Osaka said merchant vessels passed by and failed to notice the lad.Fajar Firdaus, an Indonesian diplomat from the consulate in Osaka, told The Jakarta Post: “Every time he saw a large ship, he said, he was hopeful, but more than 10 ships had sailed past him, none of them stopped or saw Aldi.” Eventually crew aboard Panamanian-flagged MV Arpeggio finally spotted him and sailors plucked him from the waters of Guam - over 1,200 miles from Manado - on August 31.He was dropped off in Japan before being flown home to his family.Details of the amazing fight for survival and rescue came to light today.

Honourable Iranians, support, support.”They also shouted: “Death or freedom.”The protests come after Trump imposed economic sanctions on Iran which had been lted by the nuclear deal signed by Barack Obama.Speaking with The Sun Online, Shahin Gobadi, a spokesman of National Council of Resistance for Iran, said disgruntled Iranians see revolution as the “only solution”.He said: “The continuation and the frequency of the protests throughout 2018, despite the imposition of pervasive suppression and daily arrests and executions designed to intimidate the public, vividly reflects one reality.“The growing sentiment among the Iranians that the only solution is a regime change by the people.“The Iranian people and resistance units are more determined than ever to bring down the regime.“The clerical regime is fast moving towards the precipice and the mullahs overthrow has never been so tangible and within reach.“The world should realise this reality and should stand on the side of the Iranian people on their quest for freedom and democracy.”The regime has blamed the US-backed Gulf states for a terror attack on a military parade on Saturday which killed 25 people.At least 60 people were also wounded when militants disguised as soldiers opened fire at marching troops and onlookers at the parade in Ahvaz in south west Iran.President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday accused an unnamed US-allied regional country of supporting the perpetrators.Irans Foreign Ministry summoned Western diplomats, accusing them of allegedly providing havens for the Arab separatists behind the attacks.Rouhanis remarks could refer to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates or Bahrain – all close US military allies that view Iran as a regional menace over its support for militant groups across the Middle East.In July, Iranian premier Hassan Rouhani cautioned Trump over his hostile policies against Tehran.He believes there have been efforts by Washington to destabilise Irans Islamic government.Before the 1979 Iranian revolution, Iran was one of Americas biggest allies in the troubled Middle East and was led by the US-backed Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.However, since the seismic revolt, Iran has been led by murderous Islamic fundamentalists and tensions with Washington have remained ever since.On November 4, 1979, the Iranian regime took 52 US diplomats hostage in response to President Carter’s administration allowing Iran’s deposed former leader into America.The hostage crisis lasted for 444 days and also included a failed rescue mission which cost the lives of eight US soldiers.In April 1980, the US ended diplomatic relations with Iran – a break which lasted for more than 30 years.In April 1983, Washington blamed the Iranian-funded terror group Hezbollah for carrying out a bombing attack on the American embassy in Beirut, Lebanon.The assault, carried out amid a brutal civil war in Lebanon, killed 17 Americans.In November of that year, two truck bombs in Beruit killed 241 US peace keepers. The US again blamed Hezbollah for the incident.The Clinton White House, in 1995, placed a total embargo on Iran meaning US companies could not trade with the country.And in 2002, George W Bush included the Islamic Republic in his famous “Axis of evil” speech along with North Korea and Iraq.The deal was an agreement between the Islamic Republic and a group of world powers aimed at scrapping the Middle Eastern countrys nuclear weapons programme.It saw Iran agree to eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium by 98 per cent.According to the deal, Iran would receive relief from the US, European Union, and the United Nations Security Council on all nuclear-related economic sanctions.The agreement was reached on July 14, 2015, and the world powers signed it in Vienna.However,  on May 8, 2018, President Trump announced the US will withdraw from the agreement - which he has repeatedly called insane and ridiculous."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/09/2048x1152/skynews-lenny-henry-rudy_4430980.jpg?20180923145255 ","title":"arts vital for a childs sense of inclusion","story":"The truth is, this was always going to happen. When I was at Blue Coat secondary modern there was little or no attempt to cultivate dramatic aspirations during the school day.Sure, we were tasked with reading aloud or taking part in an assembly we even did a school concert the year I had successfully auditioned for New Faces. But the only drama I remember taking part in was when Mr Kipper  would have us in the hall for a double period and make us run around pretending to be characters we had seen on television or at the pictures.When we were kids, there were not many chances to pop into a performance of Hedda Gabler or the Doll\u0027s House. The fact is, theatre didn\u0027t play a massive part in my parents\u0027 lives. They spent every hour God gave putting food on the table and clothes on our backs. They were not also going to pop us in for a matinee of She Stoops To Conquer at the Wolverhampton Civic. They weren\u0027t made of money. So, no theatre.But one year, mum\u0027s factory subsidised a massive trip to the Birmingham Alexandra Theatre - suddenly, a whole bunch of kids and a parent and some teachers would be allowed to watch a pantomime.In our case it was Charlie Drake starring in Robinson Crusoe.

There are talks underway for Frank-Walter Steinmeier to join veterans and royalty for the Remembrance Sunday service, which is said to be in the spirit of peace and reconciliation.  However a leaked memo indicates that Government aides are concerned that the invite could cause upset from veterans attending. Officials heading into 10 Downing Street on Friday were carrying briefing papers, and visible among them was an email that raised concerns.  It read: “I am aware advice has previously been submitted to No 10 and a view taken that, on balance, German involvement should be focussed to the Westminster Abbey service, given the Cenotaph is about remembering those affected by all wars/conflicts rather than just WW1. “I would welcome a fresh look at this, especially an assessment of the potential concerns from veterans associations and the risk of negative Press coverage.” "},{"url":null,"title":"john mcdonnell conference speech live","story":"NewsJohn McDonnell conference speech LIVE: Updates as Shadow Chancellor unveils plans for £500 workers\u0027 bonus at Labour bashJeremy Corbyn\u0027s close ally is addressing the faithful from 12.15pm - watch live and follow blow-by-blow updates belowShare\u0026nbspByDan BloomOnline Political EditorUpdated12:25, 24 SEP 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/politics/video/watch-john-mcdonnells-speech-labour-13298849,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail/F/QVgi9PbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_/,nativeAppBanner:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url=\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx/v1/live-centre/nationals-live/13298881[]\" data-embedded-url-endpoint=\"https:www.mirror/news/politics/john-mcdonnell-conference-speech-live-13298881?service=responsive\u0026ampembeddedArticleUrl=\" data-chronos-domain=\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx/\" data-inview=\"true\"Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell is today unveiling radical plans to give workers a \u0026pound500 \u0027bonus\u0027 at the Labour Party Conference in Liverpool.

And John McDonnell said Jeremy Corbyn hopes to topple Theresa May before Christmas to start reversing the damage of her war on the poor, disabled, public services, education and health. The Shadow Chancellor also said Labour is plotting a 15-year revolution in power that will put workers’ rights, the NHS, social care and industry at the heart of a bid to make Britain a fairer place to live once again. With the Tories in disarray over Brexit, the possibility of an autumn general election looms.  And in an exclusive interview with the Mirror, Mr McDonnell said: “We’re ready… and we’ll win. “I want the election as soon as possible. Eight years of Tory austerity has left people wanting real change. So we’ll provide them with a radical manesto. “We could be in place tomorrow. I think the third term will be our most exciting. “I think  the last election had lasted another week or two, we would be in government. “Everyone thought that was a flash in the pan, there was talk about ‘Peak Corbyn’. Actually, we’ve consolidated that. The polls now are between 38 and 44, permanently. We need another 4 or 5% to get into government. “Once we get into government, that first Queen’s Speech will be popular. We will put money into people’s pockets, provide a real living wage, restore trade union rights, end \u0026shyprivatisation and start investing in public services and in the infrastructure that will give us the jobs.  “I want the Tories held to account for what they’ve done. Apart from eight years of austerity, their handling of Brexit has had a direct impact on the economy and people’s living standards. “I want them held to account. I want them out.” Mr McDonnell, 67, will today deliver a keynote speech at Labour’s annual conference in Liverpool – as the party maps out its vision of a Britain for all. It will unveil a radical plan that includes renationalising water, rail, energy and mail within the first five years of government. A National Care Service to tackle the social care crisis and end cuts will be launched. Labour is also planning a National Education Service to slash classroom sixes and increase teacher input.  Billions of pounds will be pumped into the NHS to restore it to the service that was the envy of the world until the Tories starting dismantling it. And workers could be \u0026pound500 a year better off with the launch of “inclusive ownership” of big firms in a bid to narrow the wage gap between staff and bosses. Mr McDonnell will tell delegates: “Workers, who create the wealth of a company, should share in its ownership and, yes, in the s that it makes. If Labour does last three years, Mr McDonnell will by then be 82. But he insisted the next generation of MPs is ready for the \u0026shychallenge of keeping the party in power. He added: “You’ve got the likes of Becky Long-Bailey, Richard Burgon, Angie Rayner, Kate Osamor. They’re committed, working class young people, with an eye for detail, really good advocates of our policy.” Mr McDonnell demanded the PM quit over her Brexit handling.   He said: “Theresa May has proved herself \u0026shyincapable of negotiating her way out of a paper bag. I have no sympathy for her. “She’s got us into this mess, she’s got a responsibility to the country to go. Asked whether he believed the PM would secure an EU deal, he replied: “She’ll get some form of deal, probably a fudge. It won’t be one that even her own party will support.” Labour has set six tests for any deal including a strong relationship with Europe, the same rights, \u0026shyprotections and benefits as now and fair migration.

A meeting of party chiefs to hammer out a compromise on support for a second referendum dragged on for five hours last night. But what emerged was called a \u0027fudge\u0027 by anti-Brexit campaigners. And McDonnell\u0027s interpretation of the plan has been branded an insult. Members were handed a severely watered-down chance to set party policy, which would only back putting a \u0027people\u0027s vote\u0027 on the subject of Brexit on the table as one option. Even then, it will only happen  parliament votes down Theresa May\u0027s deal and no immediate general election was on the horizon.  And this morning, the Shadow Chancellor strongly suggested remaining in the EU would not be an option in any such referendum. Asked what the vote would be on, he told the BBC: Parliament will decide what will be on that ballot paper. We will be arguing that it should be a vote on the deal itself. The claim triggered uproar among pro-EU Labour MPs. One accused the senior frontbencher of “spinning to suit his agenda”. And Pro-Corbyn, pro-EU activist Michael Chessum slammed the Shadow Chancellor\u0027s remarks - saying not having Remain as an option would be an insult. He said: The Brexit motion set you be debated by conference, which is backed and negotiated by the leadership, clearly keeps remain on the table. That was a key element of what was agreed in negotiating the motion.  This idea that any future referendum would not include a remain option is preposterous -  we\u0027re committing to a public vote, it would be an insult to the public not to trust them with all options. All options are on the table and that includes staying in that EU. Mr McDonnell\u0027s stance appeared to be at odds with a draft position agreed by the party after almost six hours of talks. Labour would only back a people\u0027s vote in a situation where the Tory deal had been voted down by parliament. Assuming, under McDonnell\u0027s interpretation, remain is not an option - it suggests Labour would be left in the unusual situation of having no option but to back no-deal in such a poll.

Angela Rayner described the academy system as not fit for purpose as she pledged to end the forced conversion of schools, saying she would instead focus on delivering what works to get the best results for pupils. She criticised the fat cat salaries of some executives at large academy chains, and said local communities have been shut out of decisions affecting schools in their area. Academies, which receive their funding directly from central government, rather than through a local authority, and have more freedom than other schools, were started under Labour with the aim of helping schools in dficulty. Now all schools are able to convert.  Ms Rayner, who will set out further details in a speech to the Labour Party conference in Liverpool on Monday, is expected to point to a lack of evidence that academy conversions under the Tories have improved results.   And she will outline plans to create a regulatory framework for schools, so parents and local communities are guaranteed a meaningful and active role in decision-making. Existing academies will be brought back into an integrated National Education Service under the proposals, and the free school programme - designed to promote a form of academy - will be scrapped. National pay rules will also be enforced to prevent executives from paying themselves fat cat salaries. The Labour frontbencher said: The Tories\u0027 academy system is simply not fit for purpose. Labour will end the forced conversion of local schools to academies, scrap the inefficient free school programme and instead focus on delivering what works to get the best results for pupils. The Tories have thrown money at an academy and free school programme that is not improving outcomes for pupils, even while inidual schools have their budgets cut year after year. We now routinely see the shocking sight of schools begging parents for financial support just to carry out day-to-day s.

But not enough of them want THIS Labour to be in government.  In the 2017 general election Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s new-old Labour got 12.8million votes. That was a massive increase on the 9.4m of Ed Miliband and the 8.6m of Gordon Brown. It still wasn\u0027t enough to win power. Corbyn\u0027s socialist manesto of workers on boards, renationalisation of essential services and more spending did not convince the people it needed to. In fact out of the three, Gordon was the one who came closest to forming a government after coming second. And his brand of socialism was the least extreme.  Official Labour policy is to sit tight and wait for Britain to see things the same way as them. That strategy has not worked once in the entire history of the world.   There is no way of knowing how many of the 12.8m voted for Corbyn, and how many were voting for a particular MP, for the Labour Party in general, or Just Not Theresa. But there\u0027s a very simple way to find out how political parties get into power. It\u0027s called history. And every time, it\u0027s when people think the party sees things the same way as them.  There\u0027s a lot of popular support for policies like renationalising the railways, despite the fact we have tried everything, nothing works, and the only real solution is to realise that a nation which invented trains cannot operate them competently. Such a policy doesn\u0027t add up and is merely a subsidy for the middle-class, but hey-ho it gets votes, whack it in the manesto.  There\u0027s also a lot of popular support for a second vote on Brexit. It should therefore be in the manesto of any party that wants to be in power. But Corbyn\u0027s sturmabteilung spent most of last night trying to stop it becoming a policy.   On the one hand, 17.4m people voted to Leave the EU. But on the other, they have two parties haggling for their souls already and a third isn\u0027t going to get much of a look-in. And on the other there are 16.1m voters literally going begging, with no-one but Vince Cable snfing around between nap times.  A YouGov poll found a walloping 70% of people want to stay in the EU and 59% want a second vote. It could get Corbyn 4m extra votes -  added to his last tally that would make him more popular than Tony Blair was in 1997.   A People\u0027s Vote survey found last month that 77% of all Labour voters want to remain. Research has shown there are only a handful of Labour Leave seats, and even the North East has abandoned its thumping support for Brexit as the economic costs become clear.  There is, in short, a clear democratic case for Her Majesty\u0027s Official Opposition to oppose Brexit. Not just hold a second vote - but campaign, hard, to remain.   Brexit has proven to be a vote for the impossible. Not only was it influenced by Russian troll factory propaganda, illegal data harvesting and the wholesale breaking of electoral law, but the vast majority of Leavers thought our border with the EU was in the English Channel.  The Northern Ireland border can be either hard or soft. The UK citizens in Northern Ireland voted, in a referendum that Vladimir Putin and foreign billionaires did not fiddle with, for a soft border. The only alternative is to imagine there\u0027s a hard border, and hope that when people-traffickers and drug-smugglers look at 300 miles of hedging they\u0027ll say to themselves: Crikey, all that imaginary barbed wire. We\u0027ll never get through, and we haven\u0027t even filed the virtual paperwork yet.  Without control of all our borders, Brexit cannot be delivered. We stay in the customs union, the single market, and we have to pay the EU. The slow-dawning realisation of this fact is causing so much panic in the Tory party they\u0027re seriously considering another general election just to distract attention.    Yet when Labour considers the size of the open goal, the distress felt by the goalie who\u0027s having bottles of pish hurled at her by her own side, and the impossibility of cooking up a red-packaged fudge that is fundamentally any dferent to a blue-packaged fudge, it has decided to sit up the other end of the pitch and wait for someone to GIVE THEM THE BALL.    Corbyn\u0027s Labour has tried pure socialism. It\u0027s not enough.  It has tried deselecting MPs who are not unquestioningly loyal to the leader. That won\u0027t be enough, especially when people notice that Corbyn was disloyal for 30 years and got elected every time.   It has suggested turning all businesses into a version of John Lewis, investment banks, and putting profits back into water companies and railways, and done it all not because it would unquestionably work but because it SOUNDS like it might and people always vote for hope.  But on Brexit, Corbyn\u0027s Labour offers no alternative. There is no hope of Remain.   Len McCluskey has insisted any second vote have no option to Remain, despite evidence that 112 constituencies have switched from Leave to Remain.  John McDonnell says there should be no option to Remain and is terried it could revive UKIP. He does not seem to have noticed it could also revive Labour, which is the only one of the two to have a possibility of power. Corbyn\u0027s position is that he wants a general election, despite losing the last one, despite his policies not being enough, and despite the fact that on the central issue of the day he will offer nothing to voters that is any dferent to the Tories. If Labour is to win power,  it is to fulfill its constitutional duty to oppose, and  it is to give democratic voice to the people it was established to serve - the poor, the workers, the oppressed, those the rich ignore, the ones whose minimum-wage jobs are a matter of le and death - then it simply must campaign to Remain.  And do it properly, this time. Not fanny about on soapboxes at the Islington branch of Waitrose muttering things into its beard. Labour won\u0027t lose its heartlands. It won\u0027t lose votes. It won\u0027t lose union support and even intravenous adrenaline couldn\u0027t save UKIP now.  It will gain power, and it can enjoy the benefit of all the EU opt-outs Britain enjoyed before, an economic revival, a jobs and investment boom, and 20 years of the Tories eating themselves from the toes up.  But  Labour sticks with Brexit, it - and we - are doomed.

An easyJet pilot has answered all the questions to everything you\u0027ve ever wanted to know about being on a plane.  At least one in six of us have a fear of flying, according to the Liverpool Echo who spoke to pilot Chris Foster.  This list should put some of your minds at rest. What would happen  you accidentally left a mobile or iPad on during take off? In reality, nothing to be concerned about. Aircraft control systems are so sophisticated now, that they wouldn’t cause any interference The regulations date back many years to when we didn’t even have things like iPads. The laws are starting to be relaxed - you can now use your devices in flight safety mode - and I think we’ll see more changes over the next few years. Is it possible for someone to open the door while in the air? No absolutely not. The aircraft is pressurized and the doors are what we call ‘plug doors’, which prevents them from being opened until the pressure is released.  Can turbulence make a plane crash? The chance of turbulence bringing down an aircraft is incredibly remote.  Turbulence causes discomfort, much like driving down a road with lots of potholes does, but it’s not dangerous or unsafe. An aircraft is built to withstand several times the force of turbulence you’re ever likely to experience.  Is it possible for a plane’s engine to ‘stall’ mid air? A plane’s engine could fail, but that’s an extremely remote possibility because the amount of care and attention that goes into maintaining an engine is incredible. Most pilots are unlikely to ever experience a technical fault with their aircraft in their entire flying career, let alone an engine failure. Why do you have to put your tray table up during take off and landing? We plan for every eventuality and  we had to abandon take off for some reason - which again, is very unlikely - a tray table could cause a passenger injury  it was left open.  And why do you have to have your window shutter open? If we had to evacuate the aircraft it’s important that the cabin crew can make sure there are no hazards outside. Keeping the shutters open gives them that visibility. Why do the lights sometimes go out just before take off? We do that when we’re taking off in darkness and it’s so our eyes can quickly adjust to the outside light, should we need to abort the take off. That happening is extremely unlikely, but we need to be prepared for every eventuality and having the lights dimmed means our vision will adjust more quickly to the light outside. When the plane is starting to climb, suddenly it can sound like the engine’s cut out - what’s that all about? We reduce the thrust of the aircraft, because it doesn’t need as much power at that point, and the nose is lowered and the shape of the wings changes, to make the aircraft more streamline for the next part of the journey - that all reduces the noise level. Some people feel their stomach drop when that happens - a bit like when you drive over the brow of a steep hill - and can find that worrying, but it’s a perfectly normal thing to happen.  What would happen  the pilot took ill during the flight? There are two pilots at all times, so the co-pilot would be promoted to the role of captain very quickly and this is something we practise regularly in the flight simulator. There’s a false myth that co-pilots aren’t as well trained as pilots, but we train to the exact same standards. It’s just that generally speaking co-pilots aren’t as experienced. The cabin crew are also trained in first aid, so  I were to take ill, they would firstly move me away from the controls and then begin to treat me. What happens  a plane gets struck by lightning? Aircraft are built to withstand being struck by lightning and other weather interference. But we also use tools and instruments such as weather radar to avoid bad weather, so the chance of being hit by lightning is remote. Is it safer to fly in the day or in the night? There’s absolutely no dference.  How close can you get to another plane without it being dangerous? Around 1,000ft is the closest, which is still a huge distance. But when you’re on a plane it’s deceptive - another aircraft can look much closer than it actually is. Are pilots allowed to eat and play music during the flight? During take off and landing it’s a very sterile environment with no non-essential conversation. You’re entirely focused on flying the aircraft. If you’re on a longer flight, perhaps down to the Canaries, it gets a bit more relaxed once you’re in the air but there’s still a lot of monitoring to be done and ious checks, plus you’ve got air traffic control talking to you, so you’re never sitting there with your ipod on. Sometimes the seatbelt light comes on when there doesn’t seem to be a reason - why is that? It’s just us being cautious - we might have been told another aircraft has experienced turbulence ahead for example. Our primary concern is everyone’s safety, so  there’s a risk we will put the light on, but sometimes by the time we get there the turbulence has gone. Do you ever get scared? I’ve been asked this many times and the answer is no - hand on heart. I’ve been flying since I was 16 and there’s never been a single occasion where I’ve felt scared in the air.

Heike Phelan, 49, married William Matthew Schfert in November 2012 in a ceremony in a US prison where he is serving a sentence for his part in a fatal kne attack in 2001. The hardened criminal first went to an adult prison for shooting and killing a man, aged just 15. The mum-of-two, whose newly-published book Child Convict tells the story of his le and the harrowing reality of prison le, the Examiner reports. In it, Heike admits her husband was forced into a \u0027fight club\u0027 in juvenile detention as a young teen and forced to thrash it out with other inmates by guards.  She says Schfert, also 49, has calmed down and mellowed a lot and now hates prison so is doing everything he needs to get parole. Heike married Mr Schfert after they became pen friends while he was a serving prisoner. She has recently applied to the US Department of Homeland Security to lt her ban on visiting the United States, which was imposed when she overstayed on a tourist visa. At present, she cannot visit her husband in prison. Mr Schfert revealed he was in and out of juvenile detention throughout his childhood after being put into care aged four. In a question and answer session with his we, he said: I was four years old when my parents put me into the foster care system because they didn\u0027t want me despite having an older and younger sibling.  I was eight years old when I left the children\u0027s home, having been told I was \u0027unfit for American family le\u0027. My parents didn\u0027t want me back, but neither would they sign the paperwork for my grandparents to become my legal s. My dad refused on the grounds that it would make both myself and my grandfather happy. I was released to the streets to fend for myself. My friend from the children\u0027s home was also released to the streets and we both stayed with my grandfather until he died when I was 13. He then turned to crime to survive a le on the streets and was soon addicted to drugs. He said: I was 13 and living on the streets. Whenever my dad was away from home, I would go round to the house and my mother would feed me.  I would turn up with Lenny  quite often, but my mother would get mad because we\u0027d be messing around and making lots of noise whilst she tried to watch television. She gave us both a dose of heroin to calm us down, although I didn\u0027t know what it was until later. Within two weeks I had an 1800 dollar a day habit, which lasted for 16 years, then I went cold turkey to stop. His habits soon saw him spending stints in juvenile detention where he learned hustles from other boys and tried them out once released. It was here officers were running a \u0027secret fight club\u0027 and pitting inmates against each other. One of the officers ran a secret fight club he said. Although many officers and staff knew about it. They would place bets on who would win. They were never fair fights though. The officer had his favoured fighters that he took good care off. The were strong, fearless and brutal.

The HGV was travelling along a village road when it went through a field and crashed into a wall and trees. It is said that one of the expensive cars came to rest in branches after it was launched during the freak midnight accident in Burton on the Wolds, Leicestershire.  The smash brought down a tree and spilled diesel all over Loughborough Road, which had to be closed for more than 10 hours, Leicestershire Live reports.   The driver of the transporter suffered minor injuries. Charnwood councillor Jonathan Morgan tweeted that the vehicle had been carrying supercars, and that one of the cars had been launched into a tree as a result of the impact. He tweeted: “Loughborough Rd, Burton on the Wolds - fallen tree blocking road currently being cleared following freak midnight accident. Car transporter with \u0026pound2m of supercars on it, crashed and brought down tree - catapulted one of the cars 50ft up, to rest in branches.”  He told Leicestershire Live: We came across it just before midnight. The lorry had one off the road and through the perimeter wall of Prestwold Hall before hitting three or four pretty large trees. One of the supercars had been flung off and was dangling in the branches of one of the trees that had been brought down. It\u0027s an odd thing to come across when your driving home on a Saturday night. He said there were about eight other cars still on the transporter but he suspected they will have been damaged, too.

Domestos believes that clean, safe toilets should be within everyone’s reach. And as a result of its campaign, hidden toilets are now being unlocked across towns, cities and villages, and offering relief to non-customers, including parents with children and the elderly who sometimes find themselves caught short with nowhere to go. We’ve been urging business owners to get on board with the scheme and open their toilet doors to the public.

Businessman Leigh Strathearn , is co-owner of Maaya Indian Kitchen \u0026amp Bar in Milton Keynes. He didn’t hesitate to sign up his restaurant when he heard about the Use Our Loos campaign.  “Because we’re an independent business, we’re all about community and doing what we can to make everyone feel welcome,” he said. “We have braille menus, vegan menus and disabled access because we want to make sure we’re as inclusive as possible, and being part of the Use Our Loos campaign is an important element of that. “As a parent I know what it’s like  you’re taking a little one out.

The family have no need to leave their dream home, but for the fact they are beginning to struggle carrying seven-year-old Ollie up and down the stairs. Financial services project manager Cliodhna, 46, said: “We knew almost as soon as he was born that Ollie had Down’s syndrome.

We simply cannot get him to go downstairs.  And  he wants to go upstairs you have to heft him over your shoulders which has become much harder as he’s grown older.” The Rosses have lived in the upmarket west London apartment building since 2001.  In that time they secured planning permission to extend into the roof area, creating a rooftop terrace with astonishing views of London’s skyline.

However, due to market fluctuations, the house remained unsold. Cliodhna said: “We went from having all the room we needed to having to move.  “We put our property on the market in April this year but the timing was appalling – nobody wanted to buy an expensive property in Central London. ‘’People are simply not putting their properties on the market unless they absolutely have to. “If you do sell your property at a bargain price, chances are you won’t be able to afford a replacement property. ‘’Eventually we took 10 per cent off the price and still couldn’t find a buyer.  “The kids are now happily settled in school, and Ollie is settled at his special needs school so we don’t want to disrupt them by moving too far away.” The luxurious apartment sprawls over the third and fourth floors of a well-maintained, red-brick mansion block on one of Maida Vale’s wide avenues. It features four bedrooms, two balconies, a sitting room and a large kitchen/diner, as well as two bathrooms and a cloakroom.  It’s also unique in having its own private roof terrace, as well as access to the building’s communal garden which is maintained by a professional gardener. The property covers approximately 1,500 square feet and comes complete with high-spec kitchen appliances from Bosch, Neff and Siemens. Outside the front door, just minutes away are the boutique stores of Lauderdale Parade and Clton Road, and it’s just a short walk from the scenic canals of Little Venice.  Since setting up the raffle in May, thousands of tickets have been sold – but the couple are a long way from having the minimum number needed to cover the cost of the four-bedroom flat. Cliodhna and house-husband Stuart, 50, are hoping to have sold at least 85,000 tickets before the closing deadline of December 31st, to find the perfect forever-home for their family.  A percentage of the ticket sales will cover fees, and also be shared equally between two charities. The first is KIDS, which provides support services to disabled children, young people and their families. The second is The London Community Foundation, which designs and manages funds on behalf of those philanthropic iniduals and organisations that wish to tackle poverty, inequality and exclusion across the capital.  In addition, there is a \u0026pound100,000 second prize and five runner-up prizes of \u0026pound10,000 in cash each. Entrants will not only have to pay \u0026pound25 for a ticket, but complete a crossword, to stay on the right side of strict gambling regulations. And the winner will also be liable to pay stamp duty on the property, as well as any usual apartment block maintenance costs.

Successful businesswoman Kayleigh Oakley, 33, pees into a water glass when she wakes up each day - before downing half a pint of the urine. She then dabs the liquid on her skin as a moisturiser and showers.  She claims it works really well to keep her complexion looking fresh - and that drinking urine has cured a letime of health conditions.  “It doesn’t taste of much, Kayleigh said of her morning drink. It\u0027s a bit salty and you can taste some minerals, but because I have a vegan diet, it isn\u0027t strong.  The businesswoman, of Newington, Kent, had battled a low immune system for years, with a strenuous day out leaving her bed-bound for a week. But just days after sipping the yellow liquid, she claims she felt transformed. “It was almost instant, she said. “Drinking urine can’t harm you and I view it as a medicine. We don’t think twice about taking drugs bought over the counter, with side-effects, yet urine has no side-effects and it works really well. “A lot of expensive skin brands contain urea, which is excreted in urine, so I have also got a really expensive product for free.” However, the British Dietetic Association says drinking your own urine is not beneficial and warns it could potentially be harmful. Kayleigh was just four when she was diagnosed with a low immune system.  And at the age of 15, she also developed Hashimoto\u0027s disease - an autoimmune condition, causing an underactive thyroid. Two years later, she was told she had chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, which causes pain all over the body. For Kayleigh, even the smallest tasks became a nightmare. “I was ill a lot of the time and le felt like really hard work,” recalled the businesswoman, whose husband, Tristan, 39, is a draftsman. “If someone became unwell around me, my immune system would be so weak that I would get sick, too. She added: “It was so draining. If I did any strenuous activity I would be in bed for week, and le became pretty miserable.” Two years ago, Kayleigh, who runs an education business and teaches yoga, discovered urine therapy, where people drink their own wee for health reasons. “I was studying natural healing and medicine and was fascinated by the success stories other people shared about it,” she said.  “I had been on a long journey, trying to improve my health. I changed my diet and lestyle, trying to introduce more holistic things and not taking any pharmaceutical medicines. “I heard that urine can reset the immune system, promote general good health, and is good for the skin. It is also an ancient yogic technique, so thought I would give it a go.” Now, she drinks the mid-stream of her urine every morning, discarding the first and last parts of the flow, as she says it can contain toxins and sediment. She explained: “The morning drink contains the most hormones and nutrients. She added: “I have never been horried by the thought of drinking it and my friends and family accept what I do. We are conditioned to think drinking urine is unclean, but it’s just a sterile filtration of the blood.”  And Kayleigh claims that the proof of the pudding, so to speak, is in the eating. Within a few days of starting her new regime, which included a raw, vegan diet and regular yoga, she says she felt greatly improved. “I had an extreme amount of energy, it was amazing,” she said. “Urine works really well to clear your skin up,  you have any hormonal issues with it. So, I use it as a moisturiser, just putting some on a cotton wool and popping it on my skin before I jump in the shower. It moisturises and helps exfoliate too.” Although her husband is not a convert to urine therapy, Kayleigh says he supports her choice. “We are exposed to so many external environmental toxins,  you have ill-health it’s about trying to find a more natural health to improve it,” she said. “Now I need less sleep and wake up naturally at 5am without an alarm. A combination of my diet and yoga practice, as well as drinking urine every day, has helped to cure me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman pram poses selfies next","story":"NewsWoman with pram poses for selfies next to 15ft Storm Bronagh waves after \u0027danger to le\u0027 warningThe incident happened in Newhaven, East Sussex, as Storm Bronagh wreaked havoc across the UKShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAdam TheofilatosNeil Murphy12:00, 24 SEP 2018NewsThe woman took selfies next to the pram as dangerous waves crashed nearby \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the jaw-dropping moment a mum with a pram stopped to take selfies as 15ft high waves crashed over a seawall during Storm Bronagh.

Savanna Greywind, 22, was eight months pregnant when she went missing from her home in August 2017. Her parents and frantic boyfriend Ashton Matheny raised the alarm sparking a major police search, according to US media reports.  A neighbour reported hearing a baby\u0027s cries coming from the home of 38-year-old Brooke Crews. When officers arrived they found a newborn they suspected to be Savanna\u0027s child. Crews initially claimed the child was her own. Days later, the tragic victim\u0027s body was found wrapped in plastic and floating down a river in Fargo, North Dakota.  William Hoehn, 32, has been charged with the conspiracy to commit murder. He allegedly told Crews: If she\u0027s not dead, she is now, prosecuting lawyer Ryan Younggren said. However Hoehn says that he did not know Crews had planned to kill Greywind. He claims that when he came home he discovered Crews cleaning up blood in the bathroom. She is then said to have presented him with the baby and saying, this is our family. Greywind disappeared after visiting her next-door neighbour Crews for a dress fitting on August 19.  It was claimed by Crews that Savanna ed two days later at 3.30am and gave her the baby girl. Crews eventually confessed to police that she had tried to get the newborn from Savanna. Court documents read: “Crews admitted she had taken advantage of Savanna Greywind in an attempt to obtain her child and possibly keep the child as her own. While officials still have not understood how Greywind\u0027s body ended up in the river forensics concluded that she bled to death.

Ten-year-old Olga Chardymova\u0027s body was one of 29 Anatoly Moskvin stole from a graveyard and hid at the flat he shared with his parents in Russia. And Olga\u0027s mother, Natalia Chardymova, 46, is outraged an official request has been made to release the evil man from a secure psychiatric hospital. A court will rule this week whether to discharge the 52-year-old historian.  Moskvin mummied the dead children and dressed them in stockings, female clothing and knee  boots to make them look like dolls, even applying lipstick and make-up to their faces. He wedged music boxes inside their rib cages. The highly educated bodysnatcher - a leading expert on cemeteries - marked the birthday of each of his dead victims in his bedroom. By the time he was detained by police, he had kept Olga’s remains for nine years - and her mother Natalia did not realise that on her regular visits to her daughter’s graveside, the coffin was empty. Moskvin confessed between 2011 - when he was detained - and 2013 to 44 counts of abusing the graves and corpses of girls aged three to 12. But he was ruled to have schizophrenia and could not stand trial, and instead sent to a secure psychiatric clinic. Despite this he had a chilling message for the anguished parents of the dead children. He told them: You abandoned your girls in the cold - and I brought them home and warmed them up. Now a court is due to rule on an official request from psychiatrists to release him from a secure hospital - and continue his treatment at the home where he kept “my girls”.  Since his conviction, psychiatrists have passed a recommendation to the court every six months. Until now, it has been to keep him locked up, but this has now changed due to progress in his treatment. Russian courts often follow the recommendations of experts, sparking fear over his release which could come as soon as this week. Natalia - who now has a son aged nine - said she was appalled that Moskvin could be freed. “This creature brought fear, terror and panic into my ,” she said. “I shudder to think that he will have freedom to go where he wants.” He had warned the court that ‘I will  to my girls’,  he was ever freed, she said. But this now seems forgotten. “Neither my family nor the families of the other victims will be able to sleep peacefully. “He needs to be kept under surveillance.  “I insist on a le sentence….only under medical supervision, without the right of free movement. “Years have passed but my attitude to Moskvin has not changed at all - horror, fear and panic. “He\u0027ll cause a lot more suffering to someone else….” Natalia said she feels “shock, horror and fear - even my voice trembles now as I speak.” She said: “These are my fears, my worries… I don’t want repetition of what happened in the past. “It was very scary.” However, it is believed the court is unlikely to seek the views of bereaved parents. Moskvin is in a secure unit she can see from the window of her flat - but at least she knows he cannot raid more graves while he is shut away. “He deprived me of the right to visit my daughter, to visit her grave: as it turned out, for years I visited an empty coffin,” she added. Little Olga was murdered in 2002. She had begged her mother to be allowed to walk on her own to her granny’s flat in the next apartment block. I\u0027m ten already. I can go myself, she pleaded. Natalia relented and Olga went out with her favourite green bag and blue umbrella, never to be seen alive again.  A drug addict waiting in the lobby of her block had forced her back up to the top floor, and robbed her of her earrings, and because she tried to escape, cracked her over the head with a metal bar. Despite searches for her body, Olga\u0027s remains with the umbrella and bag were not found for five months wedged behind pipes in the block\u0027s attic. We buried her on 2 October 2002, Natalia said. “I could never imagine that almost exactly ten years later, on the 5 October 2012, I would open her grave with the police, and find her remains had vanished. Her coffin was empty, with a hole at the top from which he had pulled the remains. You can\u0027t begin to imagine it, that somebody would touch the grave of your child, the most holy place in this world for you.” Soon after the burial she and her husband Igor, now 49, found a note signed with two letters - D.A. - standing for Dobry Angel or Kind Angel, how Moskvin thought of himself. We shivered with fear each time we went to the grave, not knowing what to expect, she said. These sick anonymous notes were addressed to my daughter, calling her \u0027Little Lady’.” She said: My girl had been murdered,  anyone deserved to rest in peace, she did, but instead her grave had been robbed.” When police found her remains run Moskvin’s flat they told Natalia not to see her. The sight was too grotesque, they said. But I have seen the pictures of some of the other girls.

Although I specically said 1966-74, the Celtic fan offered: “In 1965, Jock Stein’s first signing was Irishman John ‘Jack’ Kennedy for £5,000 from Distillery FC.“He signed him two days after taking the Celtic job. Jack was the Olympic goalie in the 1964 Games.“His debut was against Raith Rovers in the Scottish League Cup on September 29, 1965, and he played for the Irish League three times.”Lochee lad Andy continued: “Gordon Marshall Sr was born in Farnham, Surrey, and made his debut for Celtic in the European Cup against Boldclub Copenhagen on September 15, 1971.“Incidentally, Gordon has a rare record with Celtic, as his two sons played for Celts.”Andy also put forward Dane Johannes Edvaldsson and English goalie Peter Latchford but they signed in 1975.Undaunted, he continued: “A wee story about Peter Latchford is that he made his debut v Boavista , and saved a penalty from Alves.“During the match, Peter was prodded in the back by soldiers with guns, and told: ‘Don’t waste time’.”Apart from Paul Wilson, none of the other offerings were signed in the time frame or did not play in league games, which was really the stipulation of the original query.India-born Wilson, who came to these shores as a one-year-old, is probably as Scottish as Rabbie Burns. Indeed, he even gained one cap for Scotland, on as a sub in a 1-1 European Championship draw against Spain in 1975.So, I’ll let this run, but, as ever, I’m willing to be educated otherwise.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"blether now its jumped to three alec sharps","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTwo dferent former Dundee junior footballers with the same name featured recently in this column.“An interesting and enjoyable article on the two Alec Sharps who played Dundee Junior football,” opened Rob Boag.“The article jabbed two fragments of my memory.“There is a third Alec Sharp who played pre-war Dundee junior football before turning professional.“Some years ago – it could easily be 10 years ago – BwB published an article about a lad named Sharp who came to visit you at the DC Thomson offices.“It was Alec Sharp’s brother  and he came with a portfolio of his dad – Alec Sharp Sr.“The portfolio was a record of his dad’s career and accomplishments in professional pre WWII football with English clubs and in Dundee junior football.“I hope there are descendants of Alec Sharp Sr who follow BwB and can refresh our memories of a very talented Dundee football player.”Rob, from Canada, continued: “The other jab from the past was a memory of one of my visits to Frankie Davie’s Lochee pub – circa 1957.“In this sports pantheon, there was a clique of sportsmen, ex-football and ex-boxers who were a Wikipedia on Dundee sports.“No quarter was given in this exclusive circle.“One evening, the topic was Dundee juniors who had turned professional and how successful their careers were.“The name Alec Sharp arose, that caught my attention – Alec Sharp Jr was a school pal.“There was a nod of unanimous approval, of unanimous acceptance that Alec Sharp Sr was a class act, a class player.“This declaration from Frankie Davie’s sports intelligentsia impressed me at that time.

We have been forced to change the defence with Murdoch out with a knee injury.“In the first 20 minutes, with Rachid Bouhenna starting, maybe not everyone was comfortable.“Afterwards we grew into the game and I don’t think that we made any mistakes.”Excuses, perhaps, but valid ones? Probably.

Whatever pitch it is we should play well.“We went to Queen of the South and I think the first half we produced one of the best performances since I’ve been here.“You come up against dferent circumstances and maybe it’s going to be 100mph wind.“Every week it’s something so  you think too much about circumstances you are not focused.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba52f4db7647.jpg ","title":"dundee woman enjoying a cuppa shocked as cops suddenly burst into her house by mistake","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA woman has described the moment police responding to reports of a stabbing mistakenly burst into her house as she was having a cup of tea.Tracy McIntosh, 48, said she had been enjoying a “cuppa” in her home on Gleneagles Road when officers burst into her property.But officers soon realised their mistake, and went to nearby Hoylake Place instead.Police Scotland has admitted it entered Tracy’s house “in error”.Tracy said she had a visitor when she saw the flashing blue lights outside shortly before 8pm on Wednesday.“It all happened so fast, I was actually shaking when they left,” she said. “My biggest fear was that my son Robbie had been injured.“Then they told me a woman had been assaulted.“One of the officers checked back in with the control room while they were in the house.“I realise the police have to respond to these incidents quickly but the streets don’t even have similar names.”A police spokesman said: “Police Scotland can confirm that on Wednesday evening officers responding to a serious incident in Ardler attended and entered an address on Gleneagles Road in error.“The correct address was then found and the incident dealt with.“Mistakes such as this do and will happen and we do not underestimate the inconvenience and upset they cause.“We will be contacting the affected resident to discuss the incident with them and provide reassurance.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"falkirk boss ray mckinnon looks ahead to clash with old club dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRay McKinnon accepts there will be an added dimension to this weekend’s game against old club Dundee United because he is only “human”.However, the Falkirk manager is adamant his sole focus will be on trying to land a first league win of the season for his new team.McKinnon will be facing United for the first time since being sacked by the Tangerines in October last year.He was axed just 10 games into the season with the Tannadice outfit in fourth place and just five points off the top of the Championship.He said: “I’m treating it just as another game but I am human, so I am naturally going to look at all the scenarios.“However, the focus will definitely be just on us and making sure we are set up properly.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inniss calls on dundee team mates to show character after seventh straight defeat","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRyan Inniss has told his Dundee team-mates to look within themselves and find the fight that will rescue boss Neil McCann from the sack.The Dens Park boss is clinging on to his job after a seventh straight defeat against Hibernian on Saturday.The 3-0 loss to Neil Lennon\u0026#8217s men means the Dark Blues have yet to take a point from their six Ladbrokes Premiership fixtures so far this season.Now next week\u0026#8217s trip to Hamilton is looking like a make-or-break showdown for McCann\u0026#8217s reign \u0026#8211 so long as Dee chiefs do not decide to act before then.With so much hanging on that clash, Crystal Palace loanee Inniss knows his side cannot lie down as meekly as they did against Hibs.But the centre-back says it is down to his new colleagues to find the desire that will halt their slide \u0026#8211 not their manager.He said: \u0026#8220We will go again but we have got to take it personally, I mean really, really personally.\u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re talking about character here \u0026#8211 not ability.\u0026#8220For me, you find your level with ability eventually.

Ron added: “Young people will help take the group forward.”Over in the West End, community council chairman Peter Menzies said the group was working on improving parking facilities for local people and businesses.He said: “We have dferent departments that deal with dferent things such as environment, the cemetery and roads.“Our duty is to reflect the will of the people and community councils are an example of what a group of people can achieve together.”Joan Chalmers, of Broughty Ferry Community Council, said: “The main issues we discuss are littering, vandalising and policing matters.“There are often instances of kids’ bikes being stolen, for example.”In the summer, the group worked towards tackling litter on the beach and organising litter picks.City Centre and Harbour Community Council has eight members and meets on the second Tuesday of every other month at either HMS Unicorn or City Chambers.Chairman Bill Newcombe said: “The group is a good way to help integration between the city centre and the harbour.”This week it was revealed community councils in Dundee received the equivalent of 1p per person living in their area in funding from Dundee City Council – the lowest amount in Scotland.Mr Menzies said: “Most of the costs involved are met by community councillors.“We would love to do more interaction but we don’t have the budget.”Mr Neave said external funding is often needed to cover community projects and that “those funds are getting harder to find”.A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting our communities to do things for themselves, and to make their voices heard in the planning and delivery of services.\u0026#8220The grant is fixed at a minimum rate of £330 with an additional minimal 1.2p per head of population.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/5ba365a0ced19-846x564.jpg ","title":"neil mccann urges his dundee players to be more decisive in front of goal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann has urged his players to be more decisive in front of goal against Hibs this weekend to finally get some Premiership points on the board.The Dark Blues host Neil Lennon’s men this Saturday still in search of their first positive result of the season and languishing at the foot of the table.With time marching on and teams above them picking up results, pressure is building at Dens Park on the management team.A wee bit of composure in front of goal, however, would be the perfect tonic to lt the spirits at Dens Park against the Hibees, according to gaffer Neil.That would have helped at Ibrox had Elton Ngwatala kept his cool in front of goal, despite being on his weaker side, as he raced beyond the Rangers defence with the score at 2-0.Kenny Miller played in the Frenchman in the 36th minute but Ngwatala dallied on the ball and didn’t even manage to get a shot off despite having just keeper Allan McGregor to beat.Had Dundee made that count, Neil insists the outcome of the match would’ve been dferent.He said: “Elton took an extra touch and I don’t think he needed to.“It was a blistering counter-attack, it was a lovely ball, and he should just take it early but his extra touch allows the defender to recover and doesn’t even make the keeper save.“I definitely believe it would have changed the outcome of the whole match but it’s been the story of our season where we don’t take chances or choose the right decision in the final third.”Poor decision-making has also cost the team dear in defence, with Ngwatala’s missed opportunity compounded shortly afterwards as Darren O’Dea brought Alfredo Morelos down for a penalty moments before half-time to end the match as any kind of contest.Neil added: “I felt we had enough of the game in between the second and third goal.“Darren gets injured and then makes a poor decision in the end because he was struggling.“I had no complaints about the penalty but it was a sore one because we were going in at 2-0 with us well in the game.”More frustration would follow for the Dark Blues as key man Kenny Miller saw red for a rash challenge while already on a yellow card.Referee Kevin Clancy brandished a straight red card for the tackle on Gers full-back Borna Barisic.The former Celtic, Wolves and Rangers striker will miss Saturday’s clash with another of his old clubs Hibs and the following trip to Hamilton after the club’s appeal against the decision was unsuccessful.And Miller says he’s “disappointed” to be missing out when his new club is desperate to turn their dreadful opening to the campaign around.Miller said: “Anyone who knows me knows I am not a dirty player.“My eyes were firmly on the ball throughout.“I went wholeheartedly to win the ball. I did win the ball but on the follow-through there is always going to be contact.“We have watched it back and I am actually pulling my leg away as soon as I touched the ball to try to minimise the contact.“I never went in to harm anybody and I think the red was brandished too quickly.“I have been in the game a long time but I have never gone in to hurt anybody.“It was an honest, genuine attempt to play the ball which I did.“So it is disappointing I am going to miss two games after just going to a new club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/09/dennis_locorriere_11.jpg-908x564.jpg ","title":"rock legends dr hook to play dundee show as part of 50th

design.Keppie Design\u0027 visualisation was iously branded \"bogging, hideous\" and reminiscent of bleak architecture from the \"Stalinist\" era. The developer, Dutch property firm Vastint Hospitality, could not be contacted.A y Inverness debate ended on Tuesday with an 8-7 vote to refuse the application despite Ness-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam\u0027 insistence that the vision was that of \"a grand building, that you\u0026rsquod expect to see in a serious city centre\".Inverness Central ward party colleague Richard Laird, however, successfully argued that it \"failed to make a positive contribution to the city\u0027 architecture,\" and therefore contravened the local plan.He described the design as \"absolutely bogging\" and \"exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to tear down in the middle of Inverness\".He and several committee colleagues were also concerned about the potential impact of future traffic movement in Waterloo Place and Glebe Street as a result of the proposed development.There was general support for a hotel to be built at the location but Cllr Laird said the drawing board proposition \"looks exactly the same as some of those we\u0026rsquore so desperate to teardown in the middle of Inverness\" \u0026ndash a reference to the council\u0027 recent approval for bulldozing and replacing the \u0026lsquo60s-built Bridge Street \"blots on the landscape\".Committee colleague Bill Lobban considered the hotel design \"hideous\".He said: \"It\u0027 the most visible site in the whole of Inverness. It\u0027 a very important site but it deserves something better than this. This Lego-style block might have been contemporary in 1960s East Germany looking from the wrong side of the Berlin Wall.\"Echoing that, Councillor Andrew Baxter said he had seen similar \"Stalinist\" architecture in Moldova.Peter Andrews, managing director of Vastint Hospitality, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore disappointed. We want to wait to see the council\u0027 written reasons for refusal.\u0026ldquoWhen we\u0026rsquove had a chance to review it with Keppies and probably a planning consultant then we\u0026rsquoll decide what we\u0026rsquore going to do.A spokesman for Keppie Design said: \"We\u0026rsquore naturally disappointed by the narrow decision to refuse planning permission for the scheme as it stands, despite officers recommending approval.\"The design is an honest, contemporary response to a high-profile site, using a selection of high-quality materials and massing relevant to the hotel use.\"The detail of the aesthetic and the proportions of the design have been signicantly remodelled following several post-submission meetings with the planning authority.\"Former Highland planning chairman Thomas Prag, who opposed a previous development proposal for the site while a serving councillor, said he was \"relieved\" his successors had done the same.\"I\u0026rsquom disappointed with the architects, who are well known and do some great stuff,\" he said.\"I think they were too constrained by their client\u0027 building methods.

first","story":"\u0026nbspA DOCTOR and a former detective have joined forces to launch Scotland\u0027 first absinthe blanche using ingredients hand-picked from around their 500-year-old ancestral home by the shores of Loch Ness.The couple, Lorien and Kevin Cameron-Ross, creators of the award-winning Loch Ness Gin, developed the recipe for Loch Ness Absinthe, both distilled at their home on the banks of the loch, following a trip to the birthplace of the spirit, Val-de-Travers in Switzerland.It was there Lorien learned to fine-tune the craft of making absinthe which was first used as a medicinal remedy by a French doctor living in the country, Pierre Ordinaire around the 1790s.Although best known as absinthe verte, the notorious \"green drink\", popular in the late 19th and early 20th century among artists and writers in Paris, with Vincent Van Gogh and Ernest Hemmingway among its devotees, the couple decided to create their own Scottish blanche recipe.Blanche absinthe dates back to 1910 following the ban of green absinthe in ious countries \u0026ndash although not in the UK \u0026ndash due to unproven fears it had hallucinogenic properties resulting from the use of

product, Loch Ness Absinthe, boasting our very own homegrown botanicals including wormwood mixed with nearby fresh water which flows into the famous loch.\"We felt there was gap in the market for an absinthe blanche in Scotland, a drink I really enjoy, so decided to put the wheels in motion last year and began to research its history and fully understand the craft of creating and distilling it.\"Loch Ness Absinthe, with a ABV of 53 per cent, is less potent that absinthe verte, which is usually around 72 per cent.The couple, who are firm believers in mindful drinking where you drink less and enjoy yourself more, recommend that Loch Ness Absinthe should be enjoyed slowly as an aperit, ideally in a mix of one-part absinthe to three parts iced water, poured over a sugar cube on the glass\u0027 rim.Lorien continued: \"I\u0026rsquove worked really hard to get the recipe for our latest product, Loch Ness Absinthe exactly the way I wanted and in the process perfected the art of

They have since gathered more than 14,500 signatures.And the march looks set to go ahead as planned after Highland Council revealed that the objections made in the original petition \"are not sufficient reason\" to refuse it. The local authority said objections on moral grounds were not a material matter when its licensing department decides whether to approve the temporary traffic restrictions that allow marches to proceed.It added that the petition against the march is \"being considered separately\" through its regular petitions procedures by its legal service team.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"Highland Council, Licensing has received a request for a parade on October 6 in Inverness.\"This is currently being considered under consultation with Police Scotland and the council\u0027 roads team.\"A decision on the parade will be made [this] week and a Temporary Traffic Restriction Order would be required for the march.\" They added: \"The matters raised in the petition are not sufficient reason for the council to refuse permission for the parade, and the petition is being considered separately.\"Meanwhile, Mr Morrison has accused Highland Council of \u0026lsquomoving the goalposts\u0026rsquo after claiming it had shted a deadline for views on the march to be submitted.He said his petition was submitted on September 7 \u0026ndash which he argued was the last date for comments \u0026ndash and that he had since heard the deadline had moved back to September 21.\"One cannot help but wonder whether the circulation of two online petitions, in favour of the Proud Ness march, both created within 24 hours on and around 11 September, prompted Highland Council to review and then quickly change their date, so as to accommodate the cravings of these petitioners,\" he said.\"Everyone can clearly see that the subtle and suspicious date change is most conspicuous, just as it is deeply alarming.\"Surely it is wholly inappropriate for... Highland Council to act in a manner, that very much appears to be deceptive and gives the impression of being supportive of these counter online petitions.\"Following the council\u0027 insistence that the petition\u0027 objection is not a material licensing matter, it is not clear what dference a later deadline would have made over any decision. It is also not uncommon for councils to push consultation dates back in order for extra views to be aired.Meanwhile, the creator of one of the petitions in favour of the march has spoken of her delight at the amount of support they have received.Alice Masheter said the response had been \"fantastic\" and that, even though she is not a member of the LGBT+ community, she had felt compelled to set a petition up in solidarity to show that everyone is \"accepted and welcomed up here\".She said the pro-march petitions show that the LGBT+ community \"do have a huge amount of support\" and anti-march views are \"in the minority\".Monday 24 Sep 2018 12:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117654.jpg","title":"Pensioner pleads for help with poorly cat","story":"\u0026nbspAn Inverness pensioner is appealing for help with her cat\u0027 medical treatment after discovering that her monthly pet plan does not cover the cost of an X-ray.Marie MacIver\u0027 five-year-old cat Charlie has a painful leg and needs the scan to determine what treatment can be given.However, Mrs MacIver, who relies on disability benefit, is unable to afford the X-ray, which will cost about \u0026pound300.She has now contacted the\u0026nbspmedia in a plea for kind-hearted Invernessians to come forward.\"There is no way I can afford to pay for the X-ray,\" she said.\"Since it\u0027 very dficult for me to get out, I have already had to pay for the vet to come to the house and give Charlie a medical, as well as a bottle of anti-inflammatories which cost \u0026pound29 and did nothing.\"I already pay \u0026pound10 a month for a pet plan but it doesn\u0026rsquot seem to cover anything.\"I have tried everywhere to get help with the vet\u0027 bills \u0026ndash the PDSA, RSPCA and Cats Protection, but I haven\u0026rsquot been able to get help from anywhere.\"I hate to see him in pain and I think it\u0027 getting worse.\"It came out of the blue about a month ago, and now it is just not going away.\"Mrs MacIver lives alone with Charlie and says she has a special bond with her little cat.\"He\u0027 my companion and is often the only company I have,\" she said.\"He sleeps on my bed and follows me into the kitchen, and he seems to know not to stray too far from the house because I need him.\"He\u0027 really more like a dog than a cat.\"I try my best to take care of him but things like this are very dficult, and it is such a shame because he is a lovely little cat.\"I need to help Charlie get better.\"\u0026nbspCan you help Mrs MacIver with the cost of Charlie\u0027 X-ray?

The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers. We’re also continually looking to make our services even better to give customers greater convenience as they shop online.I’d like to make your readers aware of a few changes to their doorstep deliveries so there are no surprises.Customers expecting tracked items from large retailers are among those to benefit from these changes. If they are not at home when we deliver, they will now receive email/SMS notications on the whereabouts of their delivery. For customers who have provided their contact details, the notications will confirm when their items have been delivered to a neighbour, as well as specying the neighbour’s address.The \u0026#8216Something for You\u0026#8217 card is also going digital, making it easier for customers to retrieve their item  they are not at home when we deliver. Email and SMS notications will let customers either re-arrange their parcel delivery for another day or collect their item from their local Customer Service Point using relevant identication. Customers will no longer need to go home to collect the physical card \u0026#8211 which we’ll continue to post through letter boxes.And finally customers taking pre-paid parcels  to selected Royal Mail Customer Service Points will receive an acceptance scan as soon as they drop off their item thanks to new scanning technology.Gerry McAuley, delivery director, Glasgow Mail Centre.Sir,The Supreme Court appears to have come to a sensible decision for the terminally ill in its landmark right-to-die ruling.One year ago my adult children and I watched helplessly as a most loved, mentally alert member of our family, with terminal cancer, suffered a needlessly horrible and prolonged death.This, after the patient had pleaded, for two weeks, with family doctors and religious leaders to end the constant suffering by requesting some form of assisted dying.This Supreme Court decision has come too late for our loved one but hopefully Westminster and Holyrood will now each consider and pass a bill to allow assisted dying and prevent suffering for current and future patients.Gordon Caskie, Muasdale.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor 31","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 15/08/18, 5:40 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,I wanted to thank the folk on last Thursday\u0026#8217s 14.45 number 23 bus from Oban. I foolishly stood up too soon approaching the Kilmartin stop and fell forward, landing head to door and feet in the air.Thank you to the doctor who checked me over, and to the driver and passengers who waited until I had been checked.Janet Jardine, KilmartinSir,I would like to give thanks to Tarbert Festivals Committee for all their hard work in organising the very successful Seafood Festival.Tarbert Festival Queen 2018 Chloe MacDonald with her Princesses Cara and Kaitlyn were beautul and a great credit to the festival.My thanks again to everyone who helped in any way to make this year’s festival such an amazing event and to the very many people who visited the village for the occasion.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertEditor\u0026#8217s note: With apologies to Councillor Horn for the delay in publishing this letter, originally submitted in July.Sir,The closure of the tourist centres at Tarbert and Inveraray is very worrying and I can’t understand why VisitScotland, backed by the Scottish Government, came up with such a decision.Tourism is extremely important to Argyll and Bute, and all agencies should be working together to assist the tourists that come to this area.Tarbert is in my council ward and I know how valuable the centre there is. The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a dferent form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of ersity to suit inidual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very signicant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they ed to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they ed to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terric work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

Whoever they invite and whatever they serve, people are highly encouraged to host a Macmillan Coffee Morning in a way that suits them.If people can’t bake, that doesn’t have to stop them.

The kids have had a great time with their teams playing well, building team spirit and creating a positive impression of the soccer centre and Lochgilphead.The Red Star 2007 team as well as regularly taking part in the Oban Primary League has travelled to Mossend, Oban, Crieff, Campbeltown and Helensburgh.  The kids are really developing and getting ready to move up to nine aside from now and then eleven aside in August 2019. The 2008 team has been to Mossend, Oban, Ardencaple, Campbeltown, Helensburgh, Finnart and Airdrieonians and have also been taking part in the Oban Primary League.The 2009s, 2010s and 2011s have been on trips to Oban, Campbeltown and Helensburgh. The kids played four and five aside as well as being committed to regular additional training sessions. The future looks good for when they step up to seven aside.Finally the girls team took part in both Oban and Campbeltown festivals. The enthusiastic girls have developed enormously in the last nine months. It\u0026#8217s great to see such an active group of girls growing from around eight girls this time last year to nearly 20 now.The action continues with teams due to take part in Haldane and Lochnell festivals in September.

Jemma won the two-lap race in 25.7 seconds and placed highly in another three events. Beth won the high jump clearing 1.14m and the long jump and Kirstie had an outstanding run to win the four-lap race in 55.5 seconds. The other event winner in this contest was Jemma’s twin sister Jorja who won the javelin throwing 14 metres.Local girl Neve Bowden was the under 9 champion thanks to wins in the four-lap race and long jump. Scarlett Speirs from Inveraray was runner-up winning the high jump and two-lap race. Carla Renton from Campbeltown won the javelin in this age group.Violet Campbell from Glenbarr dominated in the under 13’s contest winning all five events including a 6.49 metres throw in the shot putt. Emma Plumber from Tayvallich was runner up with Kyra Robertson from Ardrishaig in third place.Karis Kidd from Ardrishaig was the under 15 champion, winning the two running events and the long jump and finished 1.5 points ahead of Amy Gibson from Bunessan on Mull who won the high jump with a 1.40 metres clearance. Caryn Kerr from Campbeltown was third on overall points and won the shot putt with a 6.67 metres throw. The previous week Caryn won the junior shot putt at Oban Highland Games.Three girls tied on points in the under 7’s competition and the final placings were decided on the most inidual wins which resulted in Cara Green from Ardrishaig the winner ahead of Zara Whyte and Chloe Hill.Ruairidh Charnock from Lochgilphead was the boys under 7 champion just one point ahead of Olly MacVicar from Tighnabruaich. Ruairidh won the two-lap race and long jump while Olly won the four-laprace and javelin throwing nine metres.Local boy George Balkeen dominated in the under 9’s with a clean sweep of wins which included impressive performances in the two-lap race recording 27.9 seconds, four-lap in 61.6 and a 10.50 metres javelin throw. Luke MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was second overall and Ciaran Johnstone from Oban was third.Roan MacVicar from Tighnabruaich was the under 11 champion thanks to wins in the two running events and finished four points ahead of Sam Gillespie from Lochgilphead who won the high jump and javelin throwing an impressive 14.25m. Third placed Robert Kerr from Campbeltown won the long jump in this section.Two Kintyre boys excelled in the under 13’s with Lewis Gilchrist from Tayinloan champion thanks to wins in the two-lap race in 22.9 and four-lap race in 48.2 seconds. Runner-up Ruaridh Campbell from Glenbarr won the shot putt throwing 9.76 metres and third placed Murray MacDonald also impressed winning the high jump with 1.31 metres and long jump.The entry was disappointing in the two older age groups where Finlay MacLean from Oban won the under 15’s ahead of Ewan Ferguson from Lochgilphead. Finlay won four events and Ewan won the high jump.Jake Gillespie from Lochgilphead was the under 17 winner ahead of Shaun Doy from Kilmichael Glassary. Shaun won the long jump and high jump clearing 1.55 metres. Jake recorded 22.1 seconds in the two-lap and threw an impressive 10.33 metres in the shot putt. Jake had a very successful summer season competing at the local Highland Games in Argyll and ended the circuit at Oban Games the previous week winning the overall Argyll junior championship.The two annual trophies in memory of the late Hugh MacArthur, founder member of the local club in 1984 who died in June 2015, were contested in the under 9 boys and under 9 girls.

What’s more, even  they don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,  released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in 2003, a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid 1990s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now, 23 years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per cell  and the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"some close shaves in the strc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/09/18, 9:00 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThere were only two Mid Argyll crews competing in the Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship  Pendragon stages at Warcop training camp in Cumbria on Sunday August 26.They were Donald Bowness and navigator Paul Gribben in their Vauxhall Nova and Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen C2R2Max. Both crews compete in the 1600 class.This was Jamie\u0026#8217s second outing in the car. In what was a wet and slippery day, only the first stage was completed in slightly drier conditions which made tyre choice dficult.Stage two was better, after a change of tyres. There were several incidents on stages throughout the day which caused delays. Jamie and Ian stopped to help on stage three when a car rolled. This caused them to lose a lot of time but priority was to ensure the other competitors were safe.By stage seven, the \u0026#8216red mist\u0026#8217 had set in on Jamie and he had a battle with a mk 2 Escort.Jamie said: \u0026#8216This is a good event, but the class in front have a phenomenal pace to compete against, although I still enjoyed it.\u0026#8217Jamie\u0026#8217s next event is Leuchars, Fe, in November which will be the final round of the STRC. He is also looking at doing the MSN circuit event in December at Knockhill.Donald and Paul also had a few close calls. On stage two they went through a fence in slippery conditions costing them around 35 seconds.Back to service, it was a change of tyres. The new tyre choice proved to be working well back on stage and they began climbing their position and setting impressive times.On stage seven, their car stopped within inches of a concrete block.At the end of a long day rallying, Jamie and Ian finished 46th overall and 14th in class, while Donald and Paul finished 7th overall with 1st in class and 1st FWD car setting a fourth fastest stage time.Donald said these were his best results so far since he started his hobby. He is now planning to have a break from competing for the rest of year to give the car a well deserved rest and some TLC.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rocky start for mid argyll rfc in first round in scottish schools cup","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 11/09/18, 8:45 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe team scheduled to play Mid Argyll Rugby Club\u0026#8217s under 16s in the first round of the Scottish Schools Cup pulled out on the morning of the game \u0026#8211 but local school pupils saved the day.Duncanrig School should have played the Mid Argyll youngsters at Lochgilphead Joint Campus, but cancelled at the last minute.A team made up of Lochgilphead high, Tarbert Academy, Campbeltown Grammar and Islay high schools was quickly formed to play as South Argyll Schools  for this cup competition.Coach Lee Buckley said: ‘As the Islay school boys were already on the ferry over for the fixture, we decided to play a development game between the 22 SAS squad members at the joint campus.‘Everyone put in an amazing effort and this session could be key when the team plays Marr College in the second round of the cup.’The team also struggled to find a pitch to play another home game on recently as there are no suitable rugby pitches in Mid Argyll.

As pupils had brought a iety of instruments, including saxophones, flutes, guitars, accordion, trombone and, of course, tuned percussion, they were surprised that the day started with just rhythmic clapping.Alison and Felix both demonstrated playing techniques on their specialist instruments. For Alison, with a few flautists in the group, this was very informative. Scary soundtracks with special string techniques was Felix’s forte.We were split into two groups with each group composing three short melodies in the style of Steve Reich. These were developed using minimalist techniques such as addition, subtraction, stretching, interlocking, shting and phasing with each melody sounding very dferent depending on the instruments within the group. We performed and gave positive feedback on each other’s work.After lunch we got together to compose a third section in the style of John Adams with input from everybody. Techniques used here included gradual transformation and even sparkles.By the end of the day we were able to put our melodies together and we performed our unnamed minimalist composition. The event involved us interacting with each other, meeting new people and learning interesting skills that will be beneficial for our exam next year. We are all thoroughly delighted to have been a part of what was a great experience.

To make things worse, defender Luke Naisby was forced off with a hamstring injury.Star tried to play their way into the game but their passing was rushed and it was Southside who added to their tally before the break after a long ball over the top resulted in a breakdown of communication at the back and the striker had the simple task of rounding Kalache and placing the ball into the net.Star pulled a goal back in the second half thanks to an excellent inidual effort from Cammy MacDonald. Chances followed for Star, but Aaron Moore\u0026#8217s shot was blocked by the Southside keeper and Gregor Peacock shot just wide of the far post.The scoring was completed by the visitors in the 85th minute when Star failed to clear a corner and the striker shot past Kalache from close range to seal a 1-4 victory.Star will look to bounce back in another tough tie on Saturday September 15 when they take on Uddingston at home in the first round of the West of Scotland Cup.

I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,  you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers\u0026#8217 attention to the Facebook page \u0026#8216Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging\u0026#8217?The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The 600 jobs in aquaculture will not last long  mass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a 25-year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start again  an alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued? It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September 7, it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The 2018 parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause \u0026#8216irrecoverable damage\u0026#8217.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception. May I please ask your readers to seek out their pipers and encourage them to represent their school as a piping quartet,  not as a full band, at the next Scottish Schools Pipe Band Championships?The championships are organised annually by the Scottish Schools Pipes and Drums Trust.

Having moved to Glasgow, Alison can no longer chair the group as a non-Argyll resident. She added that there is a degree of \u0026#8216committee fatigue\u0026#8217 among the group, while the computer equipment used by Autism Argyll is getting past its sell-by date.But the most signicant factor in ending Autism Argyll, said Alison, is a lack of support from senior management at Argyll and Bute Council over many years.She said: \u0026#8216Argyll and Bute has an agreed and published Autism Strategy, which the authority commissioned Scottish Autism to produce. There is also an implementation plan. However, neither is promoted and both are largely ignored.\u0026#8216The only time senior management appear to take any interest in those iniduals and families living with autism is  it they think it is going to cost the authority money.\u0026#8216At senior manager level, Argyll and Bute Council has rejected our knowledge, rebuffed our experiences, frustrated our efforts, sapped our enthusiasm, drained our goodwill and defeated us.\u0026#8217There is good news, however. Operating in Argyll and Bute with the support of Scottish Autism, the Get Set 4 Autism project provides online resources for professionals dealing with autism.Parents of recently diagnosed children also have access to an autism advisor and the Right Click online programme, helping to provide clear, timely and sensible information and support.Alison continued: \u0026#8216Autism Argyll has raised awareness, improved knowledge and understanding, and forged partnerships with iniduals and organisations such as Scottish Autism. We should be proud of our achievements.\u0026#8217Responding to the criticism, an Argyll and Bute Council spokesperson said: \u0026#8216We are saddened that Autism Argyll has been dissolved and we thank the organisation for its work down the years to educate the wider community on autism and to support people living with the condition.\u0026#8216We are working with our partners, including Cornerstone and Scottish Autism, on the development of residential resources in Garelochhead and Helensburgh, and also to improve services for people with autism across Argyll and Bute by way of introducing and implementing the Autism Toolbox.\u0026#8216Additionally, we have engaged with Autism Network Scotland for their assistance in further implementing our autism strategy, and these meetings will continue.\u0026#8217Responsibility for autism support also falls under the remit of Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership, and a spokesman confirmed that it had advertised for a new autism practitioner.He added: \u0026#8216We have been working closely with our partners to support those iniduals living in Argyll and Bute with autism and we have been exploring how we can build on the current services that are available. \u0026#8216PICS:Back to the beginning \u0026#8211 Autism Argyll is formed in 2000. no_a38AutismArgyll01Committee members past and present gather for the last-ever Autism Argyll AGM. 06_a38AutismArgyll03It was an emotional occasion for founder members Maureen MacIntosh, left, and chairwoman Alison Leask. 06_a38AutismArgyll02\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"furnace shop and post office facing closure","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 21/09/18, 2:49 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to ?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFurnace Village Store and Post Office is set to close at the end of the year unless someone can be found to carry on the business.The shop, with its three-bedroom bungalow behind, has been owned and managed by Mike and Syb Masters for the past 18 years.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn\u0026#8217t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry\u0026#8217s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say 10,000. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don\u0026#8217t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormous  of coastline. Scotland\u0026#8217s coast is about 18,500 kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate \u0026#8211 an enormously expensive system both in money and CO2 emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant \u0026#8211 it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September 21 is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are 90,000 people with dementia in Scotland and 1,982 people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

The handicaps are as tricky as juggling with hedgehogs  The novices keep you on your toes while the listed and the Group races have you tearing your hair out with the temptation to rip into the jolly regardless. Mind you, with just two favourites since 1980 winning the big race, perhaps we should be more confident. The Ayr Gold Cup is run over six furlongs and is open to horses aged three years or older with a maximum field size of 25. For those who like to follow trainers Richard Fahey and Andrew Balding have an excellent record in the race. They have, however, some way to go to match Yorkshire-based Irish man Kevin Ryan who has saddled four winners in the last 10 years. The pick of his entries  is MAJOR JUMBO 16/1. He comes good in September and the fast finishing second to KIMBERELLA last time out in a listed race at Chester is decent form. The current favourite has been punted hard having started the week at 8/1, and SON OF REST is now as short as 5s.  He put up his best performance yet when beaten a 1/2  by HAVANA GREY on Sunday at the Curragh. There is no guarantee that just six days on he can repeat the feat. I’m against him. Second favourite GROWL , in his career to date, has done all his winning earlier in the season and while soft ground would not be a hindrance most of his winning has come on faster turf. He’s not for me. Horses aged between four and fivr have an excellent record, but fillies and mares have yet to land a blow in the previous 16 renewals. The average winning starting price in that time was 15/1. Be bold, be brave you might say. A high draw is a bonus for this cavalry charge and with our selection MAJOR JUMBO drawn in stall 9 it should certainly not hinder this front runners chances. With 22 races under his belt, the horse has won five and been placed in 12 of the others. Those victories have come in a lower grade but MAJOR JUMBO 16/1 has acquitted himself well in Class 2 company. Apprentice jockey Finley Marsh claims a valuable 5lbs and though he is having only his second ride for trainer Ryan he is no stranger to the winners enclosure.

McCall admitted: “People are giving me credit for some kind of masterful team talk. “But the reality is our fans were dferent class and played a huge part in getting us back into that game. “At times it felt like the Somerset Road End was pulling the ball into the net. “That’s what makes this such a dficult place for opposition teams to come and we need to make the most of it. “I honestly don’t think our fans realise just how important they are to the team. “Saturday was proof of the key part they can play so let’s hope there’s a lot more to come.” United boast a 100 per cent record on home turf this season and McCall is determined that Somerset will become a fortress again. He said: “You look at the league and would maybe say Ross County have that class edge because of the money they’ve spent. “They have a Premier League squad. “But as for everyone else...there’s no reason why we can’t hold our own.  “Nobody is going to get an easy game at our place and we’re proving we can live with the other sides in this ision. “Had we kept 11 men on the park at Inverness we’d have won there and would be sitting top of the league right now. “So we know  we play at our best we’re a match for anyone.” Ayr will head for old rivals Alloa tomorrow knowing they have a chance to hit top spot should results go their way.

Last October, the Post reported how devastated cancer patients would have to travel up to 100 miles for le-saving chemotherapy as the axe falls on the treatment at Ayr Hospital. And it could take them three hours to travel from the Carrick area like the village of Ballantrae to Crosshouse in Kilmarnock as hospital chiefs push ahead with plans to centralise services. A campaigner attended a meeting of Cumnock Community Council to get their support for the campaign. He said: “I was asked to get involved in a steering group in January to fight this. “I don’t think we can’t facilitate the amount of patients in Kilmarnock “We want to keep two open. “It is consultation period just now but we think that they are going to shut the one in Ayr. “We will be looking to host roadshows to the public. “In this area, cancer had affected a lot of the population. “Very few people in this area know about the proposals. “They want to take everything down to Crosshouse.” Cumnock Community Council agreed to support the campaign. One community councillor said: “I think we need to fight this. “We also need to think of people who live in the likes of Damellington and Patna.” And the campaigner said: “We will fight to keep it open. We want the support of community councils, MSPs and councillors to keep the facility in Ayr open.” A community councillor said: “We should write to our MP andMSPs. They should listen to us and we should write to them and ask them to come here. “We should fight to keep two of them open. We should be ploughing money into the two of them. We should be fighting for two of them.” A NHS Ayrshire and Arran spokeswoman said the future arrangements for Chemotherapy Services in Ayrshire and Arran remain under review.

Eyewitnesses described a noise like an earthquake as the roof came crashing to the ground in Ayr\u0027s Phillips Square. Cars, including a Subaru Imprezza, were crushed underneath as the effect of Storm Ali was felt in full force. The impact of the storm blew the top of the flats off at around 1pm today. Resident David Hose, who stays on the top floor of the block, described the horrying moment.  David, 28, told the Ayrshire Post: It sounded like a mini earthquake, it was a bang like I\u0027d never heard before. I looked outside and couldn\u0027t believe what I was seeing. The roof was lying on the ground on top of cars and not far from the school playground. It\u0027s a miracle it didn\u0027t kill anyone. Gordon Baillie, 36, a night porter at Ayr\u0027s Mercure Hotel, added: I was sitting on the couch watching telly and heard a big bang. I went to the window and saw my neighbour looking at his car as his Subaru was stuck underneath it. They\u0027ve taped everything off and we\u0027re blocked inside. My partner is still at work so he\u0027ll get a fright when he comes home. Emergency services have now shut off the road in a bid to clear the scene. Police wearing hard hats are on site with loose debris currently blowing around the affected area. It comes as a number of roads have been blocked due to falling trees and debris across Ayrshire. And trains between Ayr and Glasgow have been cancelled due to blocked lines caused by the storm forced winds.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSubaruGlasgowAyrNatural disastersAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13285958.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS163197665.jpg","title":"three things learned ayr united","story":"NewsThree things we learned as Ayr United prepare for Rangers test by going top of the ChampionshipThe Honest Men warmed up for a crack at Rangers in midweek by moving to the summit of the Championship with a comfortable 2-0 win at Alloa.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson21:12, 22 SEP 2018NewsLawrence Shankland \"Get Rangers updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribingSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHigh flying Ayr United continued their dream start to the season by going top of the Championship today. Two more goals from Lawrence Shankland helped the Honest Men to victory at Alloa, putting them in prime shape for Wednesday\u0027s Betfred Cup trip to Ibrox. So what did we learn from this afternoon\u0027s display?   1. Shank You Very Much   Ayr fans are running out of superlatives for their star man and he delivered once again here. Lawrence Shankland arrived at Somerset Park 12 months ago with a reputation of unfulfilled talent - but it\u0027s safe to say he has long since put that record straight. Shankland is much more than a penalty box striker and he proved it again here with an all action display, leading from the front. His first goal - a clinical finish - underlined the class dference between these sides and Ayr rarely looked back. Most pleasing for United fans was the sight of Shankland berating teammates for a couple of loose passes as the clock ticked down in its final seconds. His desire and drive to raise standards is proving an example to all and with Shankland in their ranks, the sky could be the limit for Ayr.   2. Liam\u0027s A Touch Of Class   He was talked up as a quality signing and Liam Smith is proving the real deal. The Scotland under-21 full back has been deployed on the left during Daniel Harvie\u0027s suspension and, even though not his natural position, has looked a standout. Once again he offered Ayr real thrust here and was involved in most of their positive play. Boss Ian McCall has said he expects Smith to slot in at right back in the long term, but with such competition for places it is a nice problem to have.    3. Could Ayr Really Stun Rangers?   This was a workmanlike performance from United and they will need to raise their game signicantly to trouble Steven Gerrard\u0027s men on Wednesday night. But Ayr will rarely have the chance to go to Ibrox in better heart and in Shankland they have a genuine match winner who would not look out of place at the top of Scotland\u0027s Premiership. If they can hold their nerve and service the 15-goal striker, they may just cause a shock.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterRangers NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Rangers newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrScotland U21s football teamAyr United FCAlloa Athletic FCRangers FC"},{"url":null,"title":"sign-up-for-deaf-comedy-tour-as-two-borders-dates-revealed","story":"AFTER a sell-out run at the Edinburgh Fringe, a two-time Scottish Comedian of the Year finalist is heading to the Borders.\nRay Bradshaw will take his critically acclaimed stand up show Deaf Comedy Fam on a four-month UK tour, which includes a two stops in the region, one at Peebles\u0026rsquo Eastgate Theatre on October 4, and another at Galashiels\u0026rsquo MacArts Centre on November 2.\nAround one in six people suffer from hearing loss, two of those people are Ray\u0026rsquos parents.\u0026nbsp\nRay\u0026rsquos show presents a first for stand-up comedy.\nHe tells his stories in English as well as his first language, British Sign Language.\u0026nbsp\nGrowing up with deaf parents, Ray has many hilarious and eye-opening tales to share \u0026ndash including the time he learned that Santa wasn\u0026rsquot deaf.\nDubbed as a \u0026ldquotruly unique show, the gig represents a desire of Ray\u0026rsquos to make the world of comedy more accessible for deaf people \u0026ndash  only to take the pressure off himself when it comes to making his parents laugh.\u0026nbsp\nDeaf Comedy Fam debuted at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival and completely sold out, before moving to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for a critically-acclaimed, fully sold out run.\u0026nbsp\nRay has numerous radio credits under his belt with BBC Scotland and BBC Radio 4, has supported Irish comedian Ardal O\u0026rsquoHanlon on his recent tour and is a regular guest on Frankie Boyle and Friends.\nHaving launched his comedy career in 2008, Bradshaw has quickly established himself as one of the brightest and most exciting acts on the UK comedy circuit.\u0026nbsp\nA two-time Scottish Comedian of the Year finalist, Bradshaw had a sell-out run with I Dare Ray To\u0026hellip in 2015, as well as two sell-out seasons at Adelaide Fringe in 2015 and 2016.\u0026nbsp\nIn the past year, he has performed at Adelaide Fringe, Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Singapore Fringe and the Kuala Lumpur Comedy Carnival.\nFor Ray\u0026rsquos performance at the Eastgate, tickets are \u0026pound15, \u0026pound13, \u0026pound6 for under 15s and can be bought at \nwww.eastgatearts\n.\nFor his show at Galashiels\u0026rsquos MacArts visit \nwww.ticketsource/macarts\n.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"double-delight-as-us-and-oz-come-together-at-st-boswells-live","story":"LATER this month St Boswells Live will be hosting a sublime event co-headlined between Aussie and resident Borderer Jenny Biddle, and USA west coast performer John Craigie.\nBoth of them are consummate songwriters and musicians, telling tales ranging from the heartbreaking to the outright hilarious, each in their own very dferent styles.\nIf Tracy Chapman married Joni Mitchell but then had a saucy love affair with Ani Dranco, you\u0026rsquod get Jenny Biddle.\nWith six albums under her belt and an iTunes chart-topping single, indie folk/blues songsmith, Jenny wraps herself around her guitar, and like a marriage between body and instrument, she commands her instrument to talk \u0026ldquowith uncommon skill and absolute self-assurance .\nHer audience is compelled to join her on a voyage of passion and story in song.\nAcoustic guitar-maker, proficient pianist, recovering chocoholic, and harmonica squawker, our Aussie singer is now based in sunny Scotland, touring internationally, and practising the art of making a woodstove fire with wet wood.\nFor this evening Jenny will be recording a live album which the audience will be a part of, something truly not to be missed.\nJenny explained why she relocated to the Scottish Borders: I\" moved over for love -

We are all focused on working to ensure children are healthier, happier and stronger.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"more-than-4000-rams-go-under-hammer-at-kelso-sales","story":"KELSO Ram Sales lived up to its international reputation yet again on Friday as turnover came within a whisker of matching last year\u0027s record.\nBuyers and sellers from across the UK and further afield converged on the Borders Union Showground for Europe\u0027s biggest one-day sheep sale.\nAnd from the 10am bell, this year rung by veteran breeder Jimmy Jeffrey, the 15 rings were a constant hive of activity throughout the day.\nTexels yet again proved to be the most lucrative with a top price of \u0026pound29,000 being reached for a Shearling from North Grangour in Lanarkshire.\nThe highest price paid for a Bluefaced Leicester Shearling was \u0026pound8,000 by the McClymont family of Tinnis above Selkirk.\nBy the end of the day\u0027s sale, a total of 3979 Shearlings and 411 Lambs had gone under the hammer.\nAllan Campbell\u0027s Texel topped the Lambs price lists after going for \u0026pound5,000, closely followed by another Texel from North Dorlaithers, which went for \u0026pound4,600.\nA total of seven dferent auctioneering companies managed to keep up with the demand from buyers.\nFollowing the day\u0027s business a total of \u0026pound2,991,860 had changed hands - just five percent down on 2017\u0027s record-breaking year when \u0026pound3million was reached for the first time.\nAnd the average price of \u0026pound681.52 was only \u0026pound28.22 down on last year, but up on previous years.\nMags Clark from the Border Union Agricultural Society was at the helm for the first time this year.\nShe said: \"The quality of the animals on sale at Kelso Ram Sales is always second to none and that\u0027s why we welcome buyers and sellers from across the UK and Ireland for this signicant event in the country\u0026rsquos agricultural calendar.\n\"We are extremely grateful to all our sponsors, trade stands, supporters and off course the buyers and sellers for their support of the 2018 Sale.\n\"We look forward to seeing you on the September 13, 2019.\"\nTop prices paid for Shearling breeds were: Beltex \u0026pound4,000, Berrichon \u0026pound450, Blue Texel \u0026pound700, Bluefaced Leicester \u0026pound8,000, Border Leicester \u0026pound1,300, Charmoise \u0026pound300, Charollais \u0026pound1,800, Dassenkop \u0026pound460, Dutch Texel \u0026pound1,800.

the HMS Platypus Cup became the club\u0026#8217s mixed doubles championship\u0026#8217s coveted trophy and names began to be inscribed.As with any weather dependent sport there were years when the championship was not played, or perhaps there were not enough ladies and gents to run a mixed doubles competition.If the teams were always picked from a hat, the method used currently, it would explain why partnerships did not endure, unless by luck, though one strong player may win successively.The cup\u0026#8217s first winners in 1919 were: Mrs Chapman and Mr R. Y. Maxtone, the following year Mr Maxtone partnered Miss B Strang.1921 must have been a strange year for mixed doubles. The winner is inscribed as P. S. MacNair without a partner. Sometimes it can be a struggle to get teams, so perhaps MacNair played singles against a doubles pair.In 1922 honours were taken by Miss C. K. MacNish and Mr E. Armour. In 1923 a dferent pair emerged Miss J. I. McKersie and Mr A. G. MacKelvie.Miss B. Strang ed, partnered by Mr L. Edwards in 1924.

As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

The girl and the boy were trapped in the locked vehicle and were only rescued after passers-by heard the traumatised girl screaming \u0026ldquohelp, save us.  The concerned passer-by contacted the police and managed to calm the distraught children down by waiting by the vehicle while it was parked in a lay-by near to Prestonpans last year.  Yorkston, who was in charge of the children\u0026rsquos welfare, eventually appeared about 30 minutes later claiming he had \u0026ldquoonly been five minutes and had been relieving himself.  The 28-year-old then jumped into his car and drove away from the lay-by, leaving the police to launch a hunt for him and the two children.  Yorkston had previously admitted abandoning the children in the car last August when he appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court earlier this year and he was due back in the dock last Wednesday.  Solicitor Cameron Tait, defending, said that his client had not attended court but asked Sherf Adrian Cottam to deal with the case in his absence.  Mr Tait added that the care of the children was now under supervision of the local social work department.  Sherf Cottam agreed and decided to admonish Yorkston on the charge of abandoning the children.  Previously, the court heard that the two children were spotted within the locked vehicle parked at a lay-by on the B1361 at about 5.30pm on August 16 last year.  Fiscal depute Mark Keane said: \u0026ldquoWitnesses were out for a walk and they observed a stationary car in the lay-by and saw two children within the car who very distressed.  \u0026ldquoThe girl was shouting \u0026lsquohelp, save us\u0026rsquo.  When asked where the person looking after her was, the girl pointed to an opening in the trees.  The fiscal added that \u0026ldquothe car was locked and the windows were fully up and it was \u0026ldquoa hot day.  \u0026ldquoThe witnesses became concerned about the children\u0026rsquos welfare and decided to phone the police and stay with the car for about 25 minutes, the fiscal added.  Solicitor Lesley Cunningham, defending, told the court that Yorkston had stopped for a toilet break as he took the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos restaurant.  Ms Cunningham said that her client had \u0026ldquoan underlying drug problem at the time of the incident which was \u0026ldquonow resolved.  She added: \u0026ldquoMr Yorkston was taking the children to a McDonald\u0026rsquos and stopped by the side of the road for the toilet. He admits now this was foolish in the extreme. Fortunately there was no harm done to the children.  Yorkston admitted to being responsible for two children and wilfully abandoning them by leaving them alone within a locked vehicle while windows were fully closed in hot weather conditions at a lay-by on the B1361 near to Prestonpans on August 16 last year."},{"url":null,"title":"popular-former-musselburgh-church-minister-is-remembered","story":"  The American-born clergyman served Musselburgh Congregational Church, on Links Street, for 41 years after being inducted as its minister in 1968.

Just two weeks before he died, Mr Lindgren was moved to Herdmanflat Hospital in Haddington until a permanent home could be found but he passed away on July 18.  Mr Lindgren was born in Lynn, Massachusetts, on May 28, 1930 his father Raymond was Swedish and his mother Effie was a Macleod from the isle of Skye.  Mr Lindgren was ordained into church ministry in 1957 at the age of 27, holding a list of degrees including a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology and PhD.  He was inducted into the Ministry of Genoa Congregational Church in Nebraska, where he served for six years.  With practical experience under his belt, he went on to complete a post-graduate degree at New College Edinburgh before arriving in Musselburgh, where he took an avid interest in community le.  The Rev Janice Andrews, minister at Musselburgh Congregational Church, said: \u0026ldquoHe was one of the longest-serving members of Musselburgh Rotary Club.  \u0026ldquoWhen Musselburgh hosted the district conference he was charged with preaching to 1,000 delegates \u0026ndash an onerous task but members had complete confidence in his ability to speak to such a large audience, he was so very competent.  \u0026ldquoFor over 20 years of his ministry he served as chaplain to the 297 Musselburgh Squadron RAF Air Cadets.  \u0026ldquoHe had a keen interest in antiques and collected old postcards.  \u0026ldquoHe used this collection to publish an illustrated history of the towns and villages of East Lothian and the city of Edinburgh, evidence of his sincere interest in this beautul and historic area of Scotland.

The restricted service was only for general advice, which makes up about a quarter of the total bureau work, but paid staff were still available for case work and outreach services as normal.  Claire said: \u0026ldquoI think a lot of people don\u0026rsquot know that CAB is a volunteer-based charity, so we do rely on volunteers to be on reception, to become general advisers and also some of them do administrative work as well.  She said that volunteers were often people who were retired but wanted to keep mentally active, those who were between jobs and wanted to build new skills, and law students looking for experience.  Claire, who also handles financial capability issues at the CAB, started out as a volunteer adviser.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe always need volunteers, who are the leblood of the CAB.  \u0026ldquoWe have about 30 [volunteers] at the moment and 12 members of staff.  \u0026ldquoWe put a lot into advisers and helping them but not everyone makes it at the other end.  \u0026ldquoAs volunteers they can also take holidays whenever they want or attend appointments but it is important that we get a certain level of commitment.  She added: \u0026ldquoGeneral advisers deal with everything from the dog next door barking too loudly to entitlement to benefits.  \u0026ldquoThey also deal with dismissal cases, as well as helping people to make phone calls and write letters.  \u0026ldquoAround 35 per cent of the cases will be about benefits and about 20 per cent on debt followed by employment, housing, customer and local issues.  The CAB\u0026rsquos other volunteer support officer, Magdalena Szulc, who also began as a volunteer, agreed with her colleague.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need people who can commit for six to seven hours\u0026rsquo volunteering each week and the training programme, which can take six to eight months.  \u0026ldquoThey also need good listening skills, to work well in teams, be open-minded, don\u0026rsquot judge people or their circumstances and enjoy helping people.

It is set amongst the fields which surround this old former mining village. The graveyard is reached taking a short walk which follows an old rail line. The surviving gravestones are not so old, yet I felt an immediate aura of antiquity as I entered the place.  As I wandered there I knew nothing of its past. I had stumbled upon it during a short walk from the village. I always explore when I get the chance, never knowing what I might find. It seemed neglected and strangely positioned, away from the village and no evidence of a kirk nearby. I assumed it to be connected to nearby Elphinstone Tower.  Yet soon afterwards I discovered that on the north-west of the graveyard there had indeed been a kirk a medieval pre-reformation chapel no less. Its foundations remain buried under the surface, its stones yet to tell its stories.  However, that is just one layer of this graveyard\u0026rsquos history, for it is described as overlying a prehistoric site of \u0026ldquonational importance by Ancient Monuments UK. I had been walking within an ancient fort, possibly as early as the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age. While visible evidence of this is now all gone, I can testy to the aura of antiquity which hangs there. Historic sites are often not just what you can see, but what you can sense and feel.  But the graveyard was not why I was in Elphinstone that day. I had taken a trip to this village to visit Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. It\u0026rsquos a \u0026lsquobullet stone\u0026rsquo set in the village.  There is more than one story about this stone. One tale tells us that an elf is trapped within it. According to this story the elf was a servant of an Elphinstone witch called Meg.  One day the witch travelled in her carriage to a nearby burn and there had eaten food, refusing to share it with her elves. While she was having a post-scoff snooze, an elf snuck into her carriage and took the leftovers. The angry witch incarcerated the elf within the stone as a punishment.  The primary school have a version of this story painted in the playground and the children there are best to tell that tale! It\u0026rsquos a story which suggests a reason for the village name: \u0026lsquoElf in Stone\u0026rsquo!  But as is often the case, there is also an older folk tale about the stone, mentioned well over 100 years ago by P M\u0026rsquoNeill in his fascinating book of the traditions of the area. In this tale Meg is also the main character. Here is my re-telling of this old story:  The stone which now stands in Elphinstone village once stood by the smiddy. It was owned by a well-kent witch of the village called Meg. She was not the only witch in the area, for she had many friends who were also witches. They were all married women, with heavy domestic duties to perform and little time for themselves during the day.  However, as night fell and their \u0026ldquoauld gude men lay soond asleep at hame, this happy group of witches would meet up at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, a short distance from the village but far enough away to be out of earshot of a sleeping husband.  Here the sisterhood would have witchy fun and play games. Meg would bring the bullet stone for a game of chuck , a game in which four stones are laid on a surface while one is thrown in the air. The player must pick up all the four stones, then catch the thrown stone as it falls back to the ground.  Perhaps this huge stone was actually the one thrown into the air. After all, they were witches and so a normal game of chuckie would have been a bit mundane. I do not know exactly how heavy it is but it would defeat anyone trying to lt it without magic or machinery.  In fact it would have been a fair challenge to carry from the village to the burn, even for a witch. And that is why Meg didn\u0026rsquot carry it to her liaisons. She used magic, of course. As her husband snored in the house she would creep out to the stone and turn it into a horse. I can visualise her mounting this confused beast in the light of the moon, then riding speedily with joyful laughter towards Harry\u0026rsquos Burn to meet her friends and enjoy the short time of freedom from domestic duties.  There at Harry\u0026rsquos Burn she would dismount and greet her friends. No doubt they all had dferent and novel methods of travel to get to their location: a flying sieve, riding a wolf, even a husband changed into a horse are all possibilities according to the beliefs of the time!  Upon her arrival Meg would lead the horse to the burn to drink. As soon as it had quenched its thirst, Meg changed it back to a stone. And so the heavy stone was successfully transported so the witches could play their game.  Then, when the fun was over, Meg turned the stone back into a horse for the  journey, carefully dismounting at the end of her journey on the same spot by the smiddy, and then transforming the poor creature back into stone.  And so the bullet stone remains in the village after Meg\u0026rsquos final journey. It can be found opposite the primary school and is called Meg\u0026rsquos Chuck. As far as I know it hasn\u0026rsquot been a horse since the last time Meg changed it into one, so it will be desperate for some exercise by now.  There is no reason not to believe that Meg also trapped an elf within the stone, as the later tale suggests. She was, after all, a witch with powerful magic.  So  you sit on it, be careful about the words you mutter. You might just accidentally say the spell that transforms it into a horse, and then you\u0026rsquoll be off on a terryingly wild ride to Harry\u0026rsquos Burn, possibly in the company of a hyperactive and by now very hungry elf.  Or maybe that would be fun! I wonder what the spell was. Maybe the children in the school have an idea?"},{"url":null,"title":"youtube-and-wikipedia-edit-a-thon-event-for-preston-tower","story":"  Dig It!

Robert Gunn, station director, said: \u0026ldquoIt is Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos 30th birthday this year and this is the 22nd statutory outage we have carried out at the station.  \u0026ldquoWe are very well practised at them and over the years we have built great relationships with the extra workers who come and support us during the outages.  \u0026ldquoThese workers will be staying in local hotels and B\u0026ampBs, eating in the area\u0026rsquos restaurants and using taxi firms.  \u0026ldquoIt is great that our investment in the power station can also benefit our local community just as the peak tourist season is coming to an end.  \u0026ldquoWe carry out maintenance and inspections on the units that generate the electricity all-year-round but a statutory outage gives us the chance to carry out pieces of work that are not possible when the reactor is operating.  Philip Mellor, chairman of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association  and owner of the Dunmuir Hotel, was delighted with the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is very positive news.  \u0026ldquoI am delighted to welcome people to Dunbar and certainly as we move into the quieter season, as the holidaymakers have left, it is the ideal time for EDF to run this type of project.  \u0026ldquoIt will massively benefit the community as a whole.  EDF Energy carries out a statutory outage on each of its reactors once every three years.  These are planned in advance with the National Grid to ensure that there is no impact on the national electricity supply.  The other reactor at Torness is due to continue operating normally throughout the period.  During the outage workers will carry out more than 12,000 separate pieces of work \u0026ndash each carefully planned during the last two years of preparation.  The biggest projects include fitting of additional reactor gas temperature instrumentation, exchange of the turbine intermediate and low-pressure rotors, and replacement of auxiliary cooling water pipework systems.  Torness Power Station\u0026rsquos two nuclear reactors generate enough electricity to power more than two million homes and started operating in 1988.  The station employs more than 500 full-time staff and about 250 full-time contract partners.  Since it opened, Torness has produced enough low-carbon electricity to save the equivalent of 84.8 million tonnes of CO2e  during its 30 years of operation, the same as taking all of the passenger cars off the UK\u0026rsquos roads for more than a year."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-womans-key-part-in-new-bbc-one-game-show-chase-the-case","story":"  The former Ross High School pupil plays a \u0026ldquofurious security guard in new strategy game Chase the Case, hosted by BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker.  Filmed over the summer in Glasgow, the show sees five contestants begin the game with a case containing a secret amount of cash. Players answer questions to win visits to a soundproof vault where they can see inside their opponents\u0026rsquo cases. The twist: they don\u0026rsquot know how much is in their own case.  In a fast-paced endgame, players attempt to steal each other\u0026rsquos cases via tense head-to-head challenges, but only the player who gets over the finish line first will win what is inside their case. There is a potential jackpot of \u0026pound5,000.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos totally dferent to other game shows, Debs told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a good bit of comedy in it, which is why I\u0026rsquom there.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot speak, it\u0026rsquos all just done with my eyes and facial expressions.

The 45-minute show starts on Monday at 2.15pm on BBC One and\u0026nbspruns for 20 episodes.  Explaining how the role came about, Debs said: \u0026ldquoI basically got a call asking  I could speak to production. It was quite surreal. I didn\u0026rsquot have to audition or anything.  The stage is nothing new for the former Centre Stage director. She left the theatre group in 2016 to give herself \u0026ldquoa wee chance and still acts in local productions.  She now runs Quirky Pond, a theatre company, with friend Yvonne Rowley. Their next show is The Naked Truth, running on November 2 and 3.  \u0026ldquoQuirky Pond is getting bigger and bigger, she said.  \u0026ldquoThe Naked Truth will have two days at The Brunton [in Musselburgh].  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about five women who take up pole dancing classes, for a iety of reasons.

Dunbar Cement Plant, which employs more than 140 people and contributes \u0026pound8 million to the local economy each year, has now been given the go-ahead to create a cement mill grinding station, storage silo and ious other facilities.  According to the planning officer\u0026rsquos report: \u0026ldquoIn a supporting statement submitted with the application it is stated that the proposal is part of Tarmac\u0026rsquos long-term internal upgrade and modernisation programme at Dunbar cement works.  \u0026ldquoIt asserts that the cement mill is necessary to produce new grades of cement required for modern construction and the cement market.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed mill will replace two existing mills on the site and will be more energy-efficient and quieter than those existing mills.  \u0026ldquoThe supporting statement also asserts that the cement works benefits from rail sidings on both the south and north side of the East Coast Mainline.  \u0026ldquoTrains run under a load out structure that feeds cement into rail tankers.  \u0026ldquoAt present, trains are fed only on the south side using adjacent silos where train capacity is already fully used.  \u0026ldquoAdditional products must therefore be exported by road.  \u0026ldquoUntil the late 1980s, the northern siding was also fed by a large silo that was dismantled. It is now proposed to reinstate a modern silo on this side to increase rail capacity.  Oliver Curtin, Dunbar Cement Plant manager, was pleased that permission had been granted, with further permissions to be secured before work gets under way, with staff levels to remain the same.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore pleased that East Lothian Council has approved our application to upgrade the facilities at Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThe plans will allow us to bring the latest technology to our operations, build on our offer to customers and maximise use of the rail network for transportation across Scotland and England.  \u0026ldquoWe will now work with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to secure appropriate operating permits.  \u0026ldquoOnce the necessary environmental permissions are in place, we will create a detailed plan for construction and operational timescales."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-pub-named-scotlands-best","story":"  The Volunteer Arms, known as Staggs, has been named\u0026nbspthe best pub in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result, he is also British No. 1 and No. 2 in two weight isions.  Faith, of Tranent, is current Yokkao Scottish Champion, WTKA British Champion, Yokkao Open British K1 Champion, and Celtic Nations Champion and is ranked No. 2 in the UK.

His memory is honoured each year by the Mackintosh Memorial lecture, which alternates between East Lothian and the University of Edinburgh, where he was also Professor of Politics.  Mackintosh was a powerful advocate of Scottish devolution when that was an unpopular view in the Labour Party.  Marking the 40th anniversary of his death, the regular memorial lecture was replaced by a panel debate on \u0026ldquoWhere Now for Democracy?, held in the Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos main chamber and chaired by Presiding Officer Ken McIntosh.  An audience of 200 heard contributions from Catherine Stihler MEP, Professor Mona Siddiqui, Baron Campbell  and Angus Robertson .  The event was followed by a reception in the Parliament, with contributions from Mackintosh\u0026rsquos daughter Charlotte Barbour Professor Peter Mathieson, principal of the Universtiy of Edinburgh and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  The reception also saw the premiere of a video about Mackintosh directed by John Boothman, a booklet about his le, and an exhibition of material from the university\u0026rsquos archives.  Mr Gray said: \u0026ldquoThe JP Mackintosh Committee wanted to mark this anniversary in a way that would pay tribute to his signicant contribution to British politics and contribute to current political debate.  \u0026ldquoThe panel debate at Holyrood brought together speakers from a range of dferent perspectives to consider the topic \u0026lsquowhere now for democracy?\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoIt was a lively and interesting debate and one which I think Mackintosh would have enjoyed.  \u0026ldquoWhether it was promoting devolution for Scotland, pooling our sovereignty with our European neighbours, or his work as a Professor at Edinburgh University, democracy and how to strengthen it was very much at the centre of his political thought and action.  \u0026ldquoThe issues Mackintosh was passionate about remain at the top of the political agenda 40 years on from his death.  \u0026ldquoHis legacy is a powerful one and I\u0026rsquom very pleased we were able to celebrate it in this way."},{"url":null,"title":"finish-line-nears-for-team-running-in-memory-of-much-missed-minister","story":"  Nine family members of the Rev Jenner Macrae \u0026ndash known as Team Jenny \u0026ndash have been taking on a series of gruelling challenges across Scotland and Northern Ireland.

Jenner died on March 2, aged 63, having been minister of St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Only three more events remain, with the family\u0026rsquos initial target of \u0026pound1,000 smashed as nearly \u0026pound7,000 has been raised.  Susan, who takes on the Scottish 10k \u0026ndash which starts and finishes in Musselburgh on Sunday \u0026ndash alongside Duncan, said: \u0026ldquoWe are completely blown away by the generosity we have come across. It has been a really positive thing for us.  \u0026ldquoYou just think the whole thing was completely ghastly and  something good can come out of it then that has got to be good.  \u0026ldquoIt is what Jenner wanted and I think she would be chuffed to bits about the money we have raised.  Also this weekend, Barry takes on the Belfast City Half Marathon.  The challenge ends in Glasgow next Sunday  when Elaine and Susan line up for the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon.  Susan, 61, thought that Sunday\u0026rsquos East Lothian run, which stretches from Musselburgh to Cockenzie and back, would be memorable.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt will be the only one on Jenner\u0026rsquos turf.  \u0026ldquoI think that will be a wee bit special.  Already the family have completed three events, with Elaine, 33, running the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen in May.

The youngest members of the squad did their bit at the parkrun in Portrush, Northern Ireland, with Susan joined by Laura, 37, eight-year-old Isla, 14-year-old Ciara and Elaine.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI think we have all found it emotional \u0026ndash just when you are standing on the start line waiting and we have had the odd laugh on the way round when something has happened.  \u0026ldquoIn Aberdeen we thought it was going to pour with rain and the forecast was dreadful. It rained a bit and then went off and we said it was Jenner sorting that out for us.

Initially a fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 was set before that was increased to \u0026pound3,000, but both figures have been smashed.

And he reaffirmed plans for a crackdown on second home ownership, to give the \u0026ldquohave-nots the chance of owning a first home.  Mr Healey said renters\u0026rsquo unions would provide support for the 11.5 million tenants\u0026nbspin the private rental sector during disputes, as well as raising the profile of renters\u0026rsquo issues.  He said: \u0026ldquoIn year one, we will legislate for new renters\u0026rsquo rights to control costs, improve conditions and increase security.  \u0026ldquoBut we know that our rights are worthless when we can\u0026rsquot enforce them, in the workplace or in the housing market.  \u0026ldquoSo I can announce today, the next Labour government will back new unions for renters, and fund them in every part of the country \u0026ndash so renters who feel helpless in the face of this housing crisis can organise and defend their rights.  Unionisation is among a raft of measures the party would introduce to give more rights and power to people who do not own a home.  Meanwhile, holiday home owners would face a new \u0026pound560 million tax to\u0026nbsptackle homelessness and address rising wealth inequality.  Mr Healey said: \u0026ldquoIt will fall to Labour to put a brake on the growing gap between Britain\u0026rsquos housing \u0026lsquohaves\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquohave-nots\u0026rsquo and ensure those who have done well out of the housing market do not leave behind those with no home at all.  \u0026ldquoSo today I can also announce the next Labour government will strike a blow against housing inequality with a new national levy on second homes used as holiday homes, to help give homeless families the chance of a first home.  Under the plans, second properties in England used as holiday homes would be subject to an average tax bill of more than \u0026pound3,200."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8725590.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"morgan-stanley-to-issue-brexit-update-to-clients-this-week","story":"  A memo seen by the Press Association \u0026ndash entitled Morgan Stanley Client Engagement Brexit Update \u0026ndash invites recipients to join a call on Thursday September 27.  The US bank is putting forward a managing director of its global capital markets ision, a member of its sales and trading team, as well a member of its legal and compliance, to lead the session.  \u0026ldquoDear Client, As part of our preparation for Brexit, we are pleased to invite you to a call explaining Morgan Stanley\u0026rsquos Brexit approach, the memo reads.  It is likely to shed more light on how it is positioning itself for the EU orce.  The Press Association understands that clients expect to start putting together paperwork by November that would enable them to do business with Morgan Stanley\u0026rsquos EU entities once Britain leaves the bloc in March 2019.  The bank follows in the footsteps of Japanese lender Nomura, which started contacting clients to transfer business from London to Germany in August so that it was \u0026ldquofully prepared in the event of a \u0026lsquoHard Brexit\u0026rsquo.  EU clients are likely to have to complete the process multiple times, as they often conduct trades with a number of banks who are also preparing for post-Brexit regulations.  The sht of business to the bloc will be a blow to London\u0026rsquos reputation as a global financial centre, as a portion of lucrative trading revenues are set to be booked on the continent rather than in Britain.  Morgan Stanley has plans to add around 200 staff in Frankfurt through a mix of new hires and relocations of its 6,000-strong UK workforce, effectively doubling its local employee bases.  The bank is also set to bulk up its Dublin office, and could add around 80 staff to its Paris entity.  London will remain Morgan Stanley\u0026rsquos European headquarters.  Peer Nomura is preparing to move around 100 staff from London to service its new EU entities, while JP Morgan is looking at relocating around 1,000 front and back-office roles across a number of its EU sites.  Among UK lenders, HSBC is on course to sht up to 1,000 jobs to France. Barclays is on track to bulk up its Dublin operations, while RBS expects that around 150 staff will help serve EU clients out of operation in Amsterdam.  Morgan Stanley declined to comment."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8491156.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"were-getting-through-it-together-watch-country-legend-shania-twain-kick-off-tour-in-glasgow-and-talk-storm-ali","story":"  Kickstarting her 18-date European tour in Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest city on Wednesday night, the icon delivered a spellbinding show, performing hits \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom Gonna Getcha Good!, \u0026ldquoUp!, \u0026ldquoThat Don\u0026rsquot Impress Me Much, \u0026ldquoYou\u0026rsquore Still The One, \u0026ldquoLe\u0026rsquos About To Get Good and \u0026ldquoMan!

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In y posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be,  not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to  to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But  this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But  Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8712035.jpg?type=article-full","title":"discover-ten-hidden-gems-in-dumfries-and-galloway","story":"  Here we highlight ten hidden gems in the area that are well worth a visit.\u0026nbsp  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Blackaddie Country House Hotel  The four star Blackaddie House Hotel is\u0026nbspa great place to relax and stay overnight or of course longer.

Besides paintings, the gallery is well known for its ied selection of original sculpture, ceramics, glass, furniture, wood, textiles and much more.\u0026nbsp The gallery has between 5-6 mixed exhibitions throughout each year, and with each exhibition changeover the gallery is completely transformed. No two exhibitions are ever the same, and even during an exhibition, displays can often change in a bid to keep everything fresh and exciting, which why so many customers enjoy ing again and again.  The gallery expanded in 2016 and is now over two levels. The downstairs space is light and airy, with a friendly and inviting atmosphere. There is access from within the gallery leading upstairs to three rooms, each filled with paintings, sculpture, ceramics, furniture and much more. The upstairs level offers a contrast to the main gallery space, presenting art in a more homely environment.\u0026nbsp Customers often find this is a nice space to view art, as they can envisage the work in their own home, as well as find time to enjoy the work in quieter surroundings.    The gallery is gaining recognition from further afield, since becoming regular exhibitors at the Edinburgh and Glasgow Art Fairs.\u0026nbsp As Kirkcudbright is a tourist location, they also now have customers from all over the UK and overseas.  The Whitehouse Gallery have an excellent website which features most of the work in the gallery and includes a selling element, so certain works can be purchased online at www.whitehousegallery.  The gallery is also a member of the Own Art scheme, whereby any original work of art between \u0026pound100 - \u0026pound2500 can be spread over ten months interest free.

Professional artist and miniaturist, Jane B Gibson, works from her studio, gallery and home and extends a warm welcome to customers new and old every Friday. She is a\u0026nbspunique artist passionate about her work.\u0026nbsp  On display Jane has a wide range\u0026nbspof works for sale, including miniature paintings, originals, prints, pendants, paperweights, coasters and cards to choose from. A great deal of Jane\u0026rsquos work comes from commissions, which can y in size from small miniatures to large oils on canvas. From family portraits to pet portraits and landscapes, Jane uses only the highest quality materials. Once completed, she can arrange for work to be framed to suit inidual preferences.    Jane\u0027s artwork is unique in more ways than one. She is\u0026nbspthe only Scot who has achieved full membership to both the Hilliard Society of Miniature Painters and the Royal Society of Miniature Painters Sculptors and Gravers , and who lives and works in Scotland.  She is currently working on a project for the RMS which will take up to two years to complete. Commissioned by a well known family who wish their ancestors to be housed in one complete collection and reduced to miniature format, they hope to\u0026nbsphand it\u0026nbspdown to the next generation.\u0026nbsp    Painting miniatures today demands self-discipline, for where large paintings give some latitude to composition, miniatures are unforgiving of the least mistake. The physical control necessary to keep absolutely still while working can be very tiring. Yet Jane\u0027s passion for her work means she would always choose this lestyle, with all its challenges.\u0026nbsp  Jane\u0026rsquos home/studio is in the small harbour town of Kirkcudbrightshire on the shores of the River Dee.\u0026nbsp  The studio is open every Friday throughout the year or customers can call first and arrange a visit.

Around 6,000 people attended the opening weekend of the Kengo Kuma-designed design museum, and from last Saturday to Friday, 27,201 people visited in total.  On the eve of the museum\u0026rsquos official opening 10,000 people gathered to enjoy headliners Primal Scream and a special light and sound installation, and on Saturday 15 September, the 3D Festival continued and was attended by another 12,600 people.  The plan for the museum expects that 500,000 people will visit in the first year, a number which will reduce to around 300,000 in the following years: so those far the attendance figures have got off to a good start.  The latter total would put it on a par with the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh or the People\u0027s Palace in Glasgow, according to figures from the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions.  V\u0026ampA Dundee, with an annual budget of \u0026pound4.5m, will stage large scale exhibitions from the V\u0026ampA in London as well as design museums from across the world.  It has a permanent and free Scottish Design Gallery, as well as a large exhibition space for paid-for shows, the first being Ocean Liners.  Philip Long, director of V\u0026ampA Dundee, said: \"V\u0026ampA Dundee officially opened its doors last Saturday and since then more than 27,000 people have explored this wonderful building and its fantastic galleries.  \"Kengo Kuma, the architect who designed V\u0026ampA Dundee, wanted the museum to become a new living room for the city and it\u0026rsquos been a joy to watch people from Dundee and further afield make themselves at home.  \"As well as museum visitors, we have also celebrated the opening of V\u0026ampA Dundee with the 22,600 people who joined us for the 3D Festival.\"  He added: \"It\u0026rsquos been a very busy week, and I\u0026rsquod like to thank everybody who has helped us celebrate this historic moment and all those who came to V\u0026ampA Dundee during our opening week.  \"We\u0026rsquore very much looking forward to welcoming even more visitors to the museum.\"  As well as the official visitors after its opening, last Friday, more than 2000 people had a \"sneak peek\" tour, including school children, teachers, those who had taken part in V\u0026ampA Dundee pre-opening learning projects and members of local community groups.  The two press preview days held in the lead up to the museum opening were attended by around 300 journalists from across the world.  V\u0026ampA Dundee is free to enter and is now open daily.  At the opening of the museum, Mr Long said that the expectations for visitors had been planned \"prudently\".  He added: \"What is very clear to us, is that this is a project that needs to work locally, it needs to work nationally, and we want to bring an international audience.  \"Within a 60 to 90 minute drive there are 750,000 people, and  you go beyond that, then it quickly goes over one million people.  \"There is a particular asset that we have - our relationship with the V\u0026ampA in Dundee.  \"That means we can continue to bring great exhibitions. It is not a static visitor attraction, it is a place which has a live programme.\""},{"url":null,"title":"paul-hutcheon-by-ending-kezs-legal-support-labour-is-helping-wings-over-scotland","story":"  BREXIT will dominate the Labour conference in Liverpool, but a bizarre legal dispute in Edinburgh will be foremost in the minds of Scottish delegates.  In 2017, the Wings Over Scotland blog - run by Stuart Campbell, who is popular among the crankier elements of the pro-independence community - tweeted an objectionable comment which mentioned gay Tory MP David Mundell.  Kezia Dugdale, at that point the leader of Scottish Labour, used her column in the Daily Record to accuse the blogger of \u0026ldquohomophobic tweets. Wings is suing the MSP for \u0026pound25,000 in damages.  CATCH UP: Labour MSPs urged to help Dugdale with legal costs  UK Labour agreed to meet her legal costs - over \u0026pound90,000 so far - and instructed lawyers to contest the action. Out of the blue, new party general secretary Jennie Formby is said to have changed her mind and Ms Dugdale has been abandoned. Scottish Labour members are furious.  It is hard to find anyone in the party who does not sympathise with Ms Dugdale, particularly given who is she up against. Fans of Bath-based Wings believe he exposes unionist untruths and calls out the so-called \"mainstream media\". He tries to take apart negative stories on the SNP and rarely criticises the Nationalist administration in Edinburgh.  The pro-Government blogger is, without doubt, Somerset\u0026rsquos most influential voice on Scottish politics and has raised over \u0026pound500,000 from his devotees. But he is loathed by opponents who believe he has lowered the tone of politics. For the average Scottish Labour activist, the court case is about more than the rights and wrongs of a tweet.  It is also true that Ms Dugdale, through her own actions, does not have much credit left in the Corbyn favour bank. She has positioned herself as a critic of the UK leader and has not been noticeably supportive of her successor, Richard Leonard. That Ms Formby felt able to cut her loose was telling.  Ms Dugdale is also regarded as self-centred. She may have misgivings about the Corbynista takeover of her party, but the only reason Mr Leonard is leader is because she bailed out after two years. Her former allies share the same view: she left her party, and her staff, in the lurch. The only thing she gave Labour was its worst ever election results.  Her post-leadership decisions have also irked colleagues. When at the helm, Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos party promised a crackdown on second jobs by MSPs. After her resignation, she jetted off to Australia to appear on a third-rate celebrity TV show, for which she was paid \u0026pound70,000. It is little wonder that some in the party believe she, not them, should pay her legal fees.  But internal party gripes should play no part in assessing the UK Labour decision, which even Ms Dugdale\u0026rsquos critics believe is as unfathomable as it is unjust.  It is not just the shaky morality of withdrawing legal support half way through a court case that rankles with Labour members. Or the insensitive way it was carried out, which appears to confirm the perception of Scottish Labour as little more than a branch office. Or the certainty that Labour would bankroll Mr Corbyn\u0026rsquos costs  he ever faced a similar problem.  Imagine how this could play out. Ms Dugdale limps along, sustained by a patchwork of crowdfunded donations and hand outs from colleagues, and loses the case. She then has to pay damages and Wings\u0026rsquo legal fees. She could face bankruptcy.  Mr Campbell, who is never slow to wind up his Unionist opponents, would no doubt see it as a victory over Labour, not just Ms Dugdale. He would be emboldened and bullet proof. And all this would have been aided by the UK party.  If you are a Labour supporter, Dugdale on a bad day is surely better than Wings over Scotland on any day. If Leonard wants to assert his authority as leader, perhaps he should call Formby again and remind her of the meaning of solidarity."},{"url":null,"title":"the-final-countdown-to-the-cool-list-whos-number-one","story":"  20. Mark Hogarth, 42, textile designer  Why? He is the Harris Tweed guru  When, earlier this year, Scotland was rebranded for the world, in the \u0026pound6 million Scotland Is Now campaign, it included a short film with Mark Hogarth, creative director of Harris Tweed Hebrides. There is good reason for this, for the former male model, who grew up on a dairy farm in Ardrossan, is widely credited with having made Harris Tweed cool again. Ten years ago, the company of which he is creative director took over a derelict mill at Shawbost, Harris. Now Harris Tweed Hebrides has an annual turnover of \u0026pound10million and employs 250 mill-workers and weavers. These days Harris Tweed has a host of celebrity fans, from Gwyneth Paltrow through to Madonna. Hogarth is at the heart of an incredible revival story. In his Scotland Is Now film, Hogarth observes, \u0026ldquoFor me the key word is pioneering \u0026ndash because the word fashion is almost synonymous with the word \u0026lsquonew\u0026rsquo. You\u0026rsquove got to captivate what is new, but not at the expense of your own tradition.  19. Mary Moriarty, 79, former pub landlady  Why? She\u0026rsquos a legend  At nearly 80 years old \u0026ndash her birthday, which she shares with her twin, is just around the corner \u0026ndash Mary Moriarty, former landlady of the Port O\u0026rsquo Leith, is still one of the coolest, most glamorous people you\u0026rsquore likely to come across in increasingly hipsterised Leith. She even has an entry on the Advanced Style website, a blog-appreciation of the fashion sense of older women by New Yorker Ari Seth Cohen. But, more crucially, she is also one of those local legends who is always out there doing her bit for the community, whether it\u0026rsquos putting her energies into the Leith Festival, or hands-on picking up litter in the park whenever there\u0026rsquos a big event. The Port O\u0026rsquo Leith, when she ran it, was one of Scotland\u0026rsquos most iconic boozers \u0026ndash a place where the clientele used to dance on the bar and it felt as  almost anything might happen. Formerly frequented by sailors, who gave it its nautical d\u0026eacutecor, it had working-class edginess. A year or so ago it refurbished and gone the way of most hipster pubs \u0026ndash but Moriarty still pops in very occasionally, for some of the old regulars are still there.  18. Mido Soliman, 42, drinks industry entrepreneur  Why? He\u0026rsquos bringing back the old-fashioned pub, with new-fangled drinks  Pubs can change an area. They can make a community. Mido Soliman had been living and working in Kinning Park for a while when he heard that the Old Toll bar was closing down. \u0026ldquoI went down to see it, he says, \u0026ldquoand it was like walking into a time machine. Beautul. It was an old pub that had just been misused. There were lots of screens and plasma screens. Soliman had long had a love of old pubs. He had grown up in West London, Ladbroke Grove, and as a child he\u0026rsquod always loved the magic of Victorian bars. \u0026ldquoIt always looked like there was a lot of fun and laughter and joyous times coming from inside. So that was what he tried to recreate. He stripped back the d\u0026eacutecor and turned it, as he puts it, into \u0026ldquoa pub that\u0026rsquos part of the community. No screens, no fruit machines, just craft beers, great drinks and knowledgeable bartenders. What brought him to Glasgow in the first place? \u0026ldquoA girl I was dating many years ago. She was from Scotland and moving back up. I thought it was a good opportunity. That relationship didn\u0026rsquot last too long but Glasgow was such a dynamic, cosmopolitan place I thought I\u0026rsquod stay. I love the city, I love the people. And now it\u0026rsquos home.  17. Karen Gillan, 30, Actor  Why? Because she\u0026rsquos putting the sass into superhero movies  You could argue that Gerard Butler is Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest Hollywood star these days. And I guess  you like meathead melodrama  that\u0026rsquos fine. But really, the clever money is on Karen Gillan these days.  She\u0026rsquos already got two  of the Galaxy movies and one Avengers movie on her Imdb listing  and she\u0026rsquos working on a sequel to Jumanji in which she will hopefully once again have the chance to show off her comic chops.  Fact is, ever since she turned up as Amy Pond in Doctor Who, dressed in a short skirt and a fancy dress version of a police unorm, Gillan has been a red-haired tonic smart, funny, ambitious and not embarrassed to be.  She\u0026rsquos conquered British TV, carved out a career for herself in the United States and even turned her hand to directing .  Now all she needs a modern-day Nora Ephron to realise that she is clearly a Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts in waiting.  16. Phil MacHugh, 31, PR guru  Why? If there\u0026rsquos a cool party he\u0026rsquos probably there \u0026ndash or running it.  MacHugh is the PR behind some of the most current brands, hotels and restaurants. If there\u0026rsquos a swanky party or opening event happening, he\u0026rsquoll probably be there, possibly dressed in a dapper pink suit and with a hairdo that looks as  it was created under zero gravity conditions. He\u0026rsquos there on the front row at many a Paris or London fashion week show. Among the many big bashes this \u0026ldquoMan about Town \u0026ndash as his column in The Scottish Sun is titled \u0026ndash has been to, was Pharrell Williams\u0026rsquo 40th birthday, where, MacHugh recalls, \u0026ldquoHe had Alicia Keys pop out a cake and sing him Happy Birthday.  But MacHugh isn\u0026rsquot just about the style and the partying \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos a television presenter and Gaelic speaker, who values his cultural heritage and believes that is cool. In the run up to the Independence referendum, he was a PR and events manager for the Yes campaign. Glasgow-raised and from a Barra family, he\u0026rsquos even a nty Highland dancer, and counts Simple Mind\u0026rsquos Mick MacNeil as a relative. What next for the PR? His agency, SKAPA, is, he says about to bring a new hotel brand to Scotland \u0026ndash Moxy hotels. Big parties are promised, naturally.  15. Kimberly Benson, 27, wrestler  Why? She rocks the wrestling ring.  You only have to watch footage of Kimberly Benson slamming an opponent to the floor to know she is on this cool list. Known by her stage name, Viper, \u0026ldquothe vixen of violence, she\u0026rsquos a star of World Of Sport wrestling and pioneer female in her sport. Benson is big in Japan, where she has a huge following, and was the first Scottish wrestler to main-event the famous Korakuen Hall. She has even been the subject of a BBC documentary, Fight Like A Girl, and is one of the key stars lined-up for World of Sport\u0026rsquos much-anticipated live tour of the UK starting in January next year.  She\u0026rsquos a charismatic, pantomime figure who swaggers across the ring in her trademark costume of leotard and fishnet tights. Part of the appeal of wrestling is, she says, \u0026ldquothe rebellion of it all. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been one of those punk-rock kids that just wanted to cheat the system in some ways. I love watching larger than le characters rebel against conformity. That\u0026rsquos why she chose the name Viper, in tribute to Stone Cold Steve Austin, the Texas Rattlesnake, one of the biggest wrestling rebels of them all.  Benson\u0026rsquos le mainly revolves around her sport, though she does still work in her father\u0026rsquos coach business in Ayrshire. As well as wrestling opponents, she has also fought off, and floored, stigma around her body shape. \u0026ldquoPeople, she has said, \u0026ldquowrote me off because of my size and what I look like and thought I was some stupid, blonde girl who was never going to amount to anything.  14. John Byrne, 78, artist and playwright  Why? You don\u0026rsquot get more dapper.  Earlier this year, when John Byrne, was named Scotland\u0026rsquos most stylish man, the artist and playwright\u0026rsquos response, it seems, was astonishment. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom surprised I\u0026rsquove lived to the age of 78, never mind being a trend-setter, he said. \u0026ldquo\u0026ldquoHalf the time I dress like a tramp. There\u0026rsquos a lot of days where I go out to the post office and I just throw anything on. I\u0026rsquom often a sight so folk steer clear of me, holding their nose.\u0026rsquo. Somehow this comment just made the artist seem even cooler. For, in his Tweed suits, cravats and brogues he has a dapper elegance. In fact, no matter what Byrne says or does, he\u0026rsquoll always be an icon of sorts. Part of it is his art, part of it his personal style, and some of it is the way he has lived his le. Byrne isn\u0026rsquot afraid to do or talk about things that are shocking to some. His marriage to Tilda Swinton, with whom he had two children, was unconventional. Recently, he revealed, he understood that he was the child of an incestuous relationship between his mother and his grandfather.  13. Hayley Scanlan, 35, fashion designer  If there\u0026rsquos one designer in Scotland who is really making a mark on pop music and popular culture it\u0026rsquos Dundee\u0026rsquos Hayley Scanlan. Her designs are so of-the-moment, that they are frequently copied by fast fashion stores \u0026ndash and what makes her all the more cool is that Scanlan is not having it. Frequently she calls them out. \u0026ldquoI just think they\u0026rsquore so brazen about it, she says. \u0026ldquoIt happens so much now and it\u0026rsquos like the norm. You\u0026rsquove got to accept it, which is not right. Why not call it out?  Twice-winner of Young Designer of the Year, Scanlan is the go-to vision for many a band \u0026ndash from Little Mix through to Jessie J. Her big influences also come from the music she grew up with: Debbie Harry, Madonna and Michael Jackson. \u0026ldquoMy aunties and my mum and dad all played the Thriller album, she recalls. \u0026ldquoI remember I used to have a Michael Jackson doll and I always used to point to the TV and say he\u0026rsquos my boyfriend.  Impressively, she managed to star up her own business round the time of the birth of her twin sons. \u0026ldquoThey were six months old and it was a bit wild and I don\u0026rsquot actually know how I\u0026rsquove managed to do it. I became a single mum, so I kind of had no choice but to work. Right now, she says, she\u0026rsquos working on a top-secret project, creating designs for a band whose name she will not ulge. She is also working on \u0026ldquoa project involving bagpipes. The coolest thing she\u0026rsquos ever done? \u0026ldquoMaking clothes for the Little Mix video last year. Even my sons think it\u0026rsquos cool because they\u0026rsquore at school and all the little girls are like Little Mix obsessed.  12. Andy Murray, 31, social media star  Why? He\u0026rsquos a master of the Instagram volley  Who cares  it\u0026rsquos not a big winning, or even playing, year for our Andy \u0026ndash he\u0026rsquos done enough of that to give him cool points to last a letime. Right now what makes him cool is not the tennis, but the social media entertainment he\u0026rsquos bringing us. It\u0026rsquos tweets like the one he did last autumn, parodying Donald Trump\u0026rsquos tweet about Time Magazine person of the year. It\u0026rsquos his banter with rival Nick Kyrgios. It\u0026rsquos pictures like the one he posted of his nose bloodied by a run in with his daughter. It\u0026rsquos the surreal Instagram Q\u0026ampA he did earlier in the year. Game, set and Instagram match to Murray.  11. Nikita Scott, 31, surfer and environmentalist  Why? She\u0026rsquos an eco-warrior of the waves  The best campaigners for the ocean are those who know it well \u0026ndash surfers, yachters, ers. One of them is Nikita Scott, born and raised in Tillicoultry, now resident in New York, where she heads up the city\u0026rsquos chapter of the eco-warrior organisation, Surfrider. Not only she leading a fight against the Donald Trump administration\u0026rsquos plans to expand off-shore drilling, but she already has one campaign success under her belt. She and her chapter fought a successful two-year campaign to stop the building of a liquefied gas port off Long Island.  Scott has been surfing since she was in her third year at the University of Glasgow and she decided to try a new club, found herself on a trip to Tiree, and was hooked. For her, part of the attraction, was \u0026ldquobeing in touch with the ocean \u0026ndash there\u0026rsquos a connection to nature that I don\u0026rsquot really get in any other situation.  What really ignited her environmental conscience, though, was some of the things she saw when she spend a year, post-university, travelling the world, working and seeking out that perfect wave. One of those things was the destruction already well under way of the Great Barrier Reef, and the other was the waves of plastic she saw when she was in Bali. The best wave she\u0026rsquos ever ridden? \u0026ldquoOne in Portugal \u0026ndash it was incredible.  10. Connor Newall  Connor Newall, 19, model  The features of Govan model Connor Newall, angular, low-browed and chiselled, have graced many a high-profile fashion campaign and magazine cover. They were there on the big Tom Ford 2018 summer campaign, and there too in a Pharrell Williams\u0026rsquo Raw brand shoot. But Newall is more than just a striking face. He is a story too. Four years ago, he was spotted, while rushing to class in Trinity High school, by a casting director Renfrew, who invited him to an audition for a short awareness film about kne crime. Newall played the lead role, but the film also had a personal relevance. His own cousin had been victim of a fatal kne crime, and, when newspapers and magazines featured his tale and he became a figurehead for the awareness campaign.  Three years later and he is one of the world\u0026rsquos iconic male models. His fashion impact is global. When we talk he\u0026rsquos preparing to go to Barcelona and shoot for GQ China, weeks ago he had been in a Vogue Homme film. What he wants now is to go back to the medium in which he made his first break, and forge a career in acting. Earlier this year, he appeared in a short film, titled Bunny, which is he says about \u0026ldquomental health awareness. He hopes this will be the start of a new career. But, he points out, global success hasn\u0026rsquot changed him too much. When he\u0026rsquos home he likes to hang out with his mum and his girlfriend. And, he says, his personal look hasn\u0026rsquot changed. \u0026ldquoI still don\u0026rsquot see what people see in me, he says. \u0026ldquoI still dress a wee bit like a Ned. It\u0026rsquos all good.  9. Marie Macklin, entrepreneur  Why? She\u0026rsquos making the regeneration happen.  When, nine years ago, in Kilmarnock, 20,000 people marched to save the Johnnie Walker plant, Marie Macklin was at the head of that crowd. This was her community, where she had grown up and gone to school \u0026ndash where her father had run a construction business. It was also a place that even during her childhood, she had seen economically decline.  But Macklin didn\u0026rsquot just stop at marching. Her experience in the financial industry in London meant she had the knowledge to take that energy and make something of it, and she did. \u0026ldquoThat day, she recalls, \u0026ldquowas the catalyst for me to create the HALO brand which will provide young people and the local community with sustainable long-term economic and social benefits.  Macklin, whose coolness extends to the bling of her flamboyant personal style, has countless awards to her name, including Female Business Leader of the Year 2017. Her aim is to bring economic le back, not only to Kilmarnock, but to other sites across the UK. It begins at the site of the former Johnnie Walker bottling plant, where their first project will be an urban park. \u0026ldquoThe HALO, she says, \u0026ldquois about being disruptive and rocking the economy to create practical advantages for local communities. We like to think and act as pioneers. It also involves forging ties with partners like Scottish Power, which she says \u0026ldquois committed to playing a key role in creating the HALO\u0026rsquos cyber and digital training and learning facility which will be at the forefront of the \u0026lsquoFourth Industrial Revolution\u0026rsquo  8. Iain Stirling, 30, comedian  Why? He is the voice of the Love Island generation  When, this year, the whole of the UK, including George Osborne, seemed to drop everything to watch Love Island, one of the chief draws of it was the man who brought the pantomime wit, irony and geekish megalomania to its voiceover. That man was Scottish comedian Iain Stirling. Back in 2017, NME had declared him the \u0026ldquoreal champion of the show. This year, it seemed he was shaping up as a cultural figure in his own right \u0026ndash bringing a show to the Edinburgh fringe, publishing a book, Not Ready To Adult Yet, at, and getting spotted at Wimbledon cosying up to his girlfriend, fellow presenter, Laura Whitmore.  But Edinburgh-born and raised Stirling was initially sceptical about doing the show that has made his name. It as only after he was invited to do the very middle-class Latitude music festival because of his part in the show that he began to realise it might be a cult hit. His theories about its success? \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about relationships. We talk about relationships essentially throughout the entire programme and there\u0026rsquos very little deviation from that \u0026ndash and relationships are the one thing that everyone wants to gossip about most of the time. It\u0026rsquos like Love Island went, \u0026lsquoDo you want to know about that stuff? Well, here\u0026rsquos a show that\u0026rsquos an hour of it every day.\u0026rsquo  7. Jamie Genevieve, 25, make-up vlogger  Why? She\u0026rsquos Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest social media star \u0026ndash and she\u0026rsquos for real  When fans turned out to meet make-up vlogger Jamie Genevieve on her recent tour promoting her first lipstick, frequently they would weep. The social media star has over 700,000 YouTube followers, and many of them feel almost as  she were their friend or big sister. Her fans, particularly those in Scotland, feel they know her, and even are supported by her. What marks Genevieve out from other make-up tutorial influencers, is how real and relatable she seems. As she said to us herself, part of her appeal, is that she is \u0026ldquoquite daft. \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot edit myself loads. If things go wrong I keep it in. If I look rubbish in one frame, I keep it in. It doesn\u0026rsquot bother me. I think everyone\u0026rsquos a bit weird and I\u0026rsquom not scared of being bit of a weirdo.  The Glasgow-based vlogger is also refreshingly honest about her looks. \u0026ldquoI think the most honest picture of me ever, she says, \u0026ldquois a picture of me jetlagged, on my couch, with a plate of dinner on my chest. Someone turned it into a meme and it went totally viral, and I was, like, \u0026lsquoBrilliant.\u0026rsquo  But Genevieve\u0026rsquos le, of course, is quite dferent from her fans. Through her weekly vlogs, they get to see her jetting across the world \u0026ndash on safari in Kenya, partying in Ibiza and staying at swanky hotels - as well as getting her lip fillers done in her local beauty clinic. She, her fiance, Jack McCann and their dog, Drogba, are probably the closest we, in Scotland, have to to our very own Kardashians.  6. Josh Littlejohn, 31, social entrepreneur  Why? He got thousands of us to sleep in the park  Josh Littlejohn has changed our perceptions of how to tackle homelessness. With his charity, Social Bite, he has gone from selling sandwiches to building a village for the homeless, and, this year, a huge project to get 800 rough sleepers off the streets of our cities.  He\u0026rsquos the man who somehow managed to lure George Clooney and Leonardo Dicaprio to his little sandwich shop on Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Rose Street, and who, last year, persuaded 8000 of us to sleep out in Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Princes Street Gardens to raise money for his Social Bite village of houses for the homeless. This year, 12,000 people will sleep out in parks in four dferent cities to fundraise for a project which he hopes will transform our approach to homelessness and get those 800 people off the streets.  Littlejohn is a trailblazer. He has a principle of not paying himself more than seven times the wage of his lowest paid member of staff. In the early days of Social Bite, he and his partner Alice Thompson, even had some of their homeless staff live in their one bedroom flat because they had nowhere else to stay.  What keeps him going? \u0026ldquoNot wanting to let down my teenage, idealistic self, he says Littlejohn\u0026rsquos own childhood in Blair Drummond was relatively affluent - his father was a successful restaurateur but he went to the local state school, marched for Make Poverty History, listened to Rage Against The Machine, and wanted to \u0026ldquochange the world.  5. Lauren Mayberry, 30, singer  Why? She\u0026rsquos our Joan of Arc  Fronting electro-pop maestros Chvrches, undeniably one of Scotland\u0026rsquos coolest bands, should be reason enough for the Stirlingshire-born singer\u0026rsquos place on The Cool List. But her contribution goes well beyond fashion and music: she has also shown herself to be an astute and unabashed contributor to discussions about sexual politics and gender issues.  Intelligent, witty and vocal, she has been trolled half to death over the years as a result, but as much as she\u0026rsquos a lightning rod for online haters so has she become a standard bearer of sorts for young feminists and gay rights activists. Earlier this year she talked about the rape threats she has had along the way, and observed that,  she had known this was what the career would be like, she might have, as a teenager thought, \u0026ldquoWhy the f--- would you want to do that?\u0026rsquo She has campaigned with Amy Poehler for girl\u0026rsquos empowerment. She wrote her master\u0026rsquos thesis on images of women in fashion magazines. Next year, she and Shirley Manson, will delver the keynote speech at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos sure to be punchy.  As she told the Sunday Herald earlier this year, she isn\u0026rsquot afraid to call out \u0026ldquobullshit when she sees, hears or reads it. Not for nothing did The Eurythmics\u0026rsquos Dave Stewart dub her a \u0026ldquopunk rock Joan of Arc.  4. Darren McGarvey, 34, rapper and author  Why? He wrote the book of the year  Even before Darren McGarvey won the Orwell Prize for political writing earlier this year, people were saying he was the stand-out, authentic voice of a generation. His memoir Poverty Safari, originally published by Luath press, for which he won the prize, had been much-anticipated \u0026ndash for McGarvey, a rapper, who performs under the stage-name Loki, had already gathered a social media following as a smart commentator who knew first-hand what deprivation was.  Poverty Safari, with its subtitle, \u0026ldquounderstanding the anger of Britain\u0026rsquos underclass, was a savage exploration of poverty. Partly it told the story of McGarvey\u0026rsquos own dficult childhood. At one point he even describes how his mother, an alcoholic and drug addict who died from cirrhosis at 36, chased after him, aged just five years old, with a serrated bread kne. But it was also a razor-sharp polemic \u0026ndash one that declared war on the conditions that allow the cycles of abuse and addiction to continue.  The world is looking for eloquent voices like McGarvey\u0026rsquos to explain things. That\u0026rsquos why he was invited on to Question Time, where he shone. It\u0026rsquos why his Poverty Safari Live, at the Edinburgh Fringe was a hit. It\u0026rsquos also why earlier this year he clinched a two-book deal with Ebury, the non-fiction wing of Penguin. It\u0026rsquos why he is the person invited to read the bedtime story at the Glasgow Sleep In The Park. He stands out in an angry world. For what marks McGarvey out is not just his own perspective, but that he is open to others. He is, as he has said, in an often all-too tribal world, trying \u0026ldquoto find out what\u0026rsquos true, even  I don\u0026rsquot like it.  3 Rachel Maclean, 31, artist  Why? She makes our social media hell into fabulous art  There\u0026rsquos no artist quite like Rachel Maclean. She has created a mad, filmic vision of her own, through a process all of her own.  Most of the strange and grotesque characters in her films are her, in disguise, transformed with thick layers of garish make-up and digital effects. She is the one lip-syncing to found audio-tracks.  She is the figure transported via green screen into a bizarre universe \u0026ndash and it\u0026rsquos all magnicently out there.  Maclean is as brilliantly surreal as Bjork, but she is also a reminder of what art can do, that journalism or a TV documentary can\u0026rsquot.  She nails the nightmare that is our social media and fake news age. Spite Your Face, the film she presented last year at the Venice Biennale, turned the Pinocchio tale into a satire on the Trump era, and, over a year on, seems more relevant than ever.  She demonstrates, too, the extremes an artist may go to for their art. Maclean spent a month eating and sleeping in Birmingham\u0026rsquos Bullring shopping centre, dressed as a giant, grotesque bunny.  For her films, she says, \u0026ldquoI live inside the world of the film quite extensively for the few years it takes to make it. The time you\u0026rsquore in costume is maybe a day, but then there\u0026rsquos just all the living and thinking about the characters.  But, with Maclean, what makes her all the more cool is that she is now taking her vision to a wider audience. This autumn will see her much-hyped first feature film broadcast on the BBC.  Filmed in the derelict spaces of St Peter\u0026rsquos Seminary, it\u0026rsquos a feminist response to Kenneth Clark\u0026rsquos landmark cultural series Civilisation.  2 Gerry Cinnamon, 32, singer  Why? He\u0026rsquos a belter.  When, earlier this month, Gerry Cinnamon added a few extra dates to his tour, they sold out in three minutes. Last week footage of Irish dancers performing to his hit, She\u0026rsquos A Belter, went viral.  There are plenty of big names out there in Scottish music, but right now it\u0026rsquos Gerry Cinnamon\u0026rsquos moment.  Right now it\u0026rsquos his very Scottish version of cool \u0026ndash just a man on a stage with his guitar, singing out some great tunes, \u0026ndash that has got Scotland absolutely buzzing. What he did at TRNSMT earlier this year said everything about him.  Taking the mainstage after J Hus pulled out, he turned the audience into a great, huge belting choir, who even chanted out his name. \u0026ldquoSee when the crowd\u0026rsquos with you, he said, \u0026ldquosinging every word it\u0026rsquos a mad feeling. Beautul mayhem.  Geoff Ellis director of TRNSMT recognized how big he was. \u0026ldquoNot since Oasis have I seen someone go on such a rapid trajectory around here, he said.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos gone from playing to 50 people to a point where he could easily sell out the Hydro.  \u0026ldquoWe had to bring him back.  What makes him all the cooler, is that success didn\u0026rsquot come early. He was told along the way that he shouldn\u0026rsquot sing with a Scottish accent.  He had to crowd source the money for his first album which came out last year.  He remains an independent musician, unattached to any record company. He\u0026rsquos a belter, in other words, with attitude.  1 Aldo Kane, 40, adventurer  Why? He keeps his cool in extremes  Almost everything Aldo Kane does is so extreme or terrying it would make most of us melt into a puddle.  He is the kind of cool, in other words, that is good at keeping calm in a hairy situation \u0026ndash whether when working with gun-toting South American narcotics dealers for the documentary, The Real Narcos, or filming inside a volcano that unfortunately happens to start erupting.  He also has a beard that looks more cofed for climbing mountains than pulling pints in a trendy pub.  Anywhere you imagine you might be nervous of going, he\u0026rsquos been there: an Ebola treatment centre, water-flooded caves, rowing a boat across the Atlantic on a world-record breaking trip.  \u0026ldquoEverything, says Kane, \u0026ldquohas been in an extreme, or remote or hostile environment. It can be benign, in a cave or a bunker, or it can be full-on being chased by Mexican drug rings.  For years Kane was the safety and ropes guy behind many of TV\u0026rsquos extreme adventure or nature shows, taking presenters to breath-taking and risky locations, but not appearing much on screen. This year he has broken through as a star himself, with all of his work on screen, and a hectic schedule of trips for many of the major television channels.  He has been in Russia with speed-obsessed Guy Martin, done a survival race in Borneo with Ed Stafford, and been on countless trips with Steve Backshall with whom he is filming the ground-breaking BBC primetime Expedition series.  When we talked in July, he had just emerged, blinking, into the light after ten days\u0026rsquo solitary confinement in a nuclear bunker, and was about to fly to the 24 hour daylight of Greenland for an expedition with Backshall.  When, last week, we emailed him, he was in Suriname in South America, about to head down the river into unexplored jungle. Somehow, in the middle of this, he was also managing to hold down a relationship with a producer of nature documentaries.  The Kilwinning-raised son of two paramedics\u0026rsquo route to exploration came via the Scouts. From 12, he and twin Ross would camp on their own, in places like Glencoe. At 16, his eyes set on adventure, he joined the Royal Marines, where he became a sniper.  He says, \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove been spoiled by the attention and the slight risky lestyle and basically it\u0026rsquos very dficult and very addictive.  What, out of all his experiences, was his most petrying moment? \u0026ldquoThere are two in the last year. Being inside the volcano when it was erupting wasn\u0026rsquot cool. Then when I was working in south America with the cartel in The Real Narcos. All around the world I\u0026rsquove worked in hazardous environments, but the worst environment is people. It\u0026rsquos human beings. I was charged by a black rhino, but that wasn\u0026rsquot nearly as scary as dealing with a coked-up real-le Narco who is carrying a gun and he\u0026rsquos just done a job.

But this could be consigned to history under radical plans to transform Scotland\u0026rsquos ferry network which are detailed in a blueprint which will go before MSP\u0026rsquos this week.  Under the proposals, the current model of serving island communities will be ripped up and instead will be based on the Norwegian system of smaller ferries covering shorter routes.  The move aims to increase capacity with more ferries and in some cases journeys being broken up using islands as \"land bridges\" to reduce journey times.  It would see islanders in the Outer Hebrides able to do business on the mainland in a day and  home without an overnight stay.  According to the expert behind it, it would also help repopulate islands as crew would live on the islands they serve rather than on board and staffing costs would be reduced.  Perhaps crucially, it would also dramatically reduce the annual subsidy paid to ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne to run the service.  The blueprint for the future of the network will go before Holyrood this week and comes as CalMac has been heavily criticised after a summer of disruption across the network due to breakdowns of the ageing fleet.  Transport expert Roy Pedersen, who spent 30 years in Highlands and Islands development, has submitted evidence which he says would radically reform the network and save the taxpayer millions of pounds in subsidies paid to CalMac.  According to the proposal, the current level of investment is well in excess of other countries but productivity is \u0026ldquoextremely poor and deteriorating.  Under his plan, a new fleet of around 10 smaller, more efficient ferries would be built with the total bill of around \u0026pound280 million. Upgrades to the ports they would serve will cost another \u0026pound20m.  Pedersen points out that Andrew Banks, owner of Pentland Ferries, is awaiting delivery of a new 100-car capacity ferry at a cost of \u0026pound14m, compared with \u0026pound50m-plus for the new hybrid green ferry MV Glen Sannox currently being built at Ferguson\u0027s.  One of the main points in the paper is reducing the number of staff required for each journey and ending the practice of ferry staff staying on board which adds to the operating costs.  Ferries would be crewed by a staff of around 12 to 14 as opposed to the 30-plus currently used.  This would allow staff to work shts similar to other operators and in Norway, and enable more ferries to run during the day and extend the timetable with services starting earlier and finishing later.  Staff would also live in the communities they serve which, it is argued, would help boost the populations of remote island communities as the smaller ferries would be based in the island ports and not on the mainland.  Pedersen said: \u0026ldquoThe alternative of crew living ashore on island communities served would contribute to the government\u0026rsquos objective of boosting island economies and reduce ship capital and operating costs.  \u0026ldquoFor the larger CalMac vessels it takes nine personnel to berth and cast-off a ship, this is done in Norway with just one hand due to efficient \u0026ldquolock-on linkspan design.  \u0026ldquoThus,  more cost-effective policies and practices along Scandinavian lines were adopted, much improved and higher capacity services could be provided for less public money.  Lock-on linkspans are already used in Scotland at the ports served by Western Ferries at Hunter\u0026rsquos Quay, near Gourock and on Shetland\u0026rsquos inter-island ferries.  Western Ferries carry more passengers and vehicles than the CalMac competition on the routes but receives no public subsidy. Each lock-on linkspan would cost around \u0026pound1.5m to install at each of the 10 large ports that CalMac would serve with the new ferries.  But while the installation costs of around \u0026pound15m seems expensive, the cost of the vessels themselves add another \u0026pound280m.  However, two new hybrid ferries being built to ease pressure on the network, the MV Glen Sannox and its sister ship, cost nearly \u0026pound100m. But the bill is set to be much higher as both are currently delayed until next summer at the earliest after hitting design problems at the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow which has heaped more pressure on the ageing fleet.  The delays come amid concerns that a recent signicant increase in traffic is causing severe problems for island communities. Tourism bosses on the Outer Hebrides have already warned the disruption has cost them millions of pounds this year.  Now CalMac\u0026rsquos own community board has condemned delays in new ferries and is demanding action. It was formed as part of CalMac\u0026rsquos successful franchise bid for the Clyde and Hebrides Ferry Service in 2016.  At a recent meeting of the board in Mallaig, \u0026ldquodisappointment and frustration was reported from all parts of the network at the continuing delays in the delivery of the overdue vessels under construction, said chairman Angus Campbell.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt a meeting, also attended by CMAL and Transport Scotland, strong reservations were expressed at the apparent lack of a coherent long-term vessel replacement plan and the funding commitments necessary to provide both an improved fleet and the port improvements needed.  \u0026ldquoThe board feel they can work alongside the operator to help improve information quality and timing including maximising local knowledge.  \u0026ldquoThe communities board are keen to work positively with all parties to produce a more resilient and ambitious future for our ferry services resulting in better economic benefits for all that they serve but feel there is a real need for action now.  Critics say the current problems has been a generation in the making. Scotland\u0026rsquos islands are getting record numbers of visitors but the boats and port infrastructure carrying them are old and are struggling to cope.  The average age of a ship is 22 and in the early 1990s, the last time Scotland had a major burst of ferry-building with 7,000 tonnes worth in 1994 alone, the average age was just 12.  Between January and the end of July this year, 2,326 out of 79,203 CalMac scheduled sailings were cancelled. Of these, 327 were for mechanical reasons. Most of the rest were because of bad weather.  The figure for cancellations for problems with the ferries looks low, not least because CalMac will stress that it laid on more than 900 extra sailings to compensate for some of them.  But when a boat breaks down, a replacement has to come from somewhere else. Somebody always loses. CalMac does not have a spare vessel, crewed and fuelled ready to move in and act as relief.  Even  it did have a spare, CalMac could far from guarantee it could use it because every port is dferent, whether it be an ageing linkspan or unusual tide, making it dficult for ferries just to slot in.  However,  every port was fitted with the same locked-in linkspan and ferries were smaller and more versatile then they could be moved around the network more easily to cover any breakdowns, according to the blueprint.  The blueprint also outlines how routes could be shortened and slash journey times.  In Norway, ferries tend to travel between the shortest points across the water, with islands themselves being part of the journey.  Rather than go round the islands, ferries will dock at the nearest point, passengers will travel across the island by road, before picking up a ferry at the other side to continue the journey by sea.  Under the new proposal, Mull and Jura could play vital roles acting as these \u0026ldquoland bridges, slash journey times and increase service frequency to Islay and the Outer Hebrides.  Ferries would dock at Craignure on Mull as normal, but Barra passengers would travel on to Tobermory where they would pick up another ferry to continue the journey.  New terminals would also be built at Glendale on Skye to shorten the crossing to Lochmaddy on North Uist and another at Kilmoluaig to Tarbert on Harris.  Likewise, Islay passengers would get a ferry from Keills on the mainland and travel to Lagg on Jura, before crossing to Islay. One other advantage is that carbon emissions would be greatly reduced without the need for hybrid fuel ferries.  Pedersen added: \u0026ldquoBoth are much shorter than the current Kennacraig to Port Askaig/Port Ellen service on Islay and would allow up to ten daily crossings and the option of direct bus services between the islands and Glasgow.  Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse, said: \u0026ldquoWe are continuing to invest in new vessels and ferry infrastructure to renew the fleet in accordance with the published Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan. Over \u0026pound1 billion has been invested in ferry services across the Clyde and Hebrides routes, since 2007.  \u0026ldquoWork is also already under way to appraise, and subsequently to deliver on, further improvements to the ferry services to the Western Isles.  The majority of all visitors to the Outer Hebrides travel through Stornoway harbour, emphasising the importance of the CalMac ferry service to both the town and the wider islands.  The M.V Loch Seaforth, the biggest vessel in the CalMac fleet, sails between Ullapool and Stornoway three times a day, bringing with it up to 700 passengers, 143 cars or 20 commercial vehicles each time it arrives in Lewis.  Some 280,000 ferry passengers, 95,000 cars and 13,000 commercial vehicles a year come to Stornoway via the ferry.  Weekend crossings operate at full capacity and strong growth in tourism means that there are severe capacity constraints during the summer months.  Stornoway Port Authority, which has ambitious plans to develop the harbour as part of a 20-year Master Plan, is developing proposals to ensure the Port is able to accommodate the freight ferry which will likely be deployed to the route over the next few years.  Alex Macleod, the authority\u0026rsquos chief executive, said: \u0026ldquoThe existing ferry provides a good service which is an absolute leline for the community. But the risks in being dependent on a single vessel underline the need for additional capacity to cope with existing requirements and future needs.  \u0026ldquoThe projects we are developing in the Master Plan will help stimulate further economic growth but capacity limitations on ferries could have an impact on that potential growth.  \u0026ldquoThere will always be dficulties with ferry traffic in such a weather-affected part of the world, and as we have done for over 140 years, we will continue to work very closely with Calmac ferries to assist with the delivery of a robust and flexible service. Liaising closely with Calmac Ferries we will work together to find solutions for the good of the islands and everyone who uses these essential ferry services.  HebCelt relies heavily on CalMac ferry services to bring thousands of music fans to Lewis each summer.  The event is a huge economic driver for the islands, generating more than \u0026pound2 million a year and filling hotels, guest houses and campsites. Half the festival audience comes from outside the islands and the ferry route from Ullapool to Stornoway is the main gateway to the Outer Hebrides for these visitors.  HebCelt is also a catalyst for many island-hopping holidays with festival-goers using it as the start of a tour of Lewis, Harris, the Uists and Barra which also depend on CalMac services.  Such is the demand during HebCelt that ferry services have been extended in recent years around festival time to ensure fans are able to get to and from the islands.  Festival director Caroline Maclennan said: \u0026ldquoWe have a really close relationship with CalMac and appreciate many of the dficulties and challenges it faces.  \u0026ldquoCalMac is doing its best with an ageing fleet. The real conversation taking place just now is the frustration over the lack of investment in our leline services by successive governments.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos easy to criticise the service when things go wrong, but there are many sides to it.  \u0026ldquoWe have a very constructive dialogue with the company which helps us effectively address issues, not just those directly affecting ferry services, but also travel to ports and connecting services which can affect both regular travellers and visitors."},{"url":null,"title":"communist-sutherland-flag-could-be-scrapped","story":"  Critics of the standard \u0026ndash which was chosen by a selection panel following a competition run by the Lord Lieutenancy \u0026ndash have branded it \u0026ldquougly, \u0026ldquohideous, \u0026ldquocommunist and \u0026ldquoa budgie with a smirk.  The design features a swooping eagle with three stars \u0026ndash known as mullets \u0026ndash on a bright yellow and orange background. The colours have been associated with the Earls of Sutherland since the 12th Century.  The process to formally recognise the flag began in February and was put on hold in March after an online petition calling for a review of the design attracted more than 900 signatures.  Leslie Sharp, who is behind the petition, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a hard thing to swallow that an unelected office has the authority to dictate the terms of selection let alone authorise the final selection. That type of dictatorial authority should be redundant in a democracy.  \u0026ldquoA county community should have the final say on what flag represents us, especially since it will be our first flag and it conceivably will be there for a long time.  \u0026ldquoI feel the people of Sutherland are being pushed around like a serf by an old and out of date authority. The people of the county Caithness got to vote on their flag so it\u0026rsquos a bit of a slap in the face that the people of Sutherland have as yet not had that same respect.  The Lord Lieutenant for Sutherland Dr Monica Main initially defended the process, insisting it was open, transparent and democratic.  And supporters of the design, which had been approved by the Lord Lyon, say that the petition signatories represented fewer than five per cent of Sutherland\u0027s population.  However, petitioners against the flag won the backing of Conservative MSP Edward Mountain. He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not a great fan of the design. I\u0026rsquom not sure it sends the vibrant image that I think that Sutherland should be sending. I would be keen for the whole design to be relooked at and for the people in Sutherland to participate in that and come up with a design that everyone would be happy with.  The Herald on Sunday has learned that the Lord Lieutenant will convene a meeting this week to rule on the flag. Dr Monica Main said: \u0026ldquoThe committee should have an announcement shortly.  Leslie Sharp, who lives in Rogart in Sutherland, said: \u0026ldquoI am of course pleased that after so much of a delay the committee will be meeting to address the proposed design.  \u0026ldquoWhat I would like to see is the people of Sutherland be given a choice. There can be one of two outcomes: either the design goes forward without the consent of the people of Sutherland or the people of Sutherland get to choose from multiple designs.  \u0026ldquoIf the present proposal goes forward then the people of Sutherland will have to reconcile themselves to the design."},{"url":null,"title":"house-of-fraser-stores-in-edinburgh-hull-and-swindon-face-closure","story":"  The Sports Direct tycoon, who recently bought the department store chain out of administration for \u0026pound90 million, has been in tense talks with landlords over rents in recent weeks.

However, Mr Ashley has been unable to save outlets in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon after landlords refused to agree to new terms that would have allowed them to remain open.  Staff at these locations, which number in the hundreds, are now going through redundancy consultation.  A fourth House of Fraser in Bath is also at risk of closure as the businessman tussles with Bath City Council, the store\u0026rsquos landlord, over new rental terms.  The billionaire, who also owns Newcastle United, described landlords who have refused new terms as \u0026ldquogreedy.  \u0026ldquoI am disappointed that in my opinion a small number of greedy landlords still refuse to be reasonable, he said.  \u0026ldquoThose landlords whom we have been unable to agree terms with include, but are not limited to, the following: Parabola Hope Street LLP, Redefine Paragon Square Hull Limited, and FI Real Estate Management Ltd.  It is understood that landlords are reluctant to agree to the low, or in some cases zero, rents Mr Ashley is demanding.  Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United, has pledged to save around 47 of House of Fraser\u0026rsquos 59 outlets since buying the chain.

The source stressed how Richard Leonard would be speaking from the conference podium he will be giving the Scottish Report today during the afternoon plenary session. Yesterday, the Scottish Labour leader gave a keynote speech at the parallel World Transformed conference when he outlined the socialist case for Britain.  Jeremy Corbyn, who for the second year running spent a week during summer touring Scotland, has made clear winning more Scottish seats at the next General Election \u0026ldquoholds the key to Labour winning power.  The Labour leader is due to speak at the traditional Scots Night, which takes place this evening."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-leonard-backs-federal-britain-to-help-rebuild-scotland","story":"  In his address to the Labour conference, the Scottish party leader will suggest there is a growing \u0026ldquorestlessness for the redistribution of power for it to be held at a more local level, which would not only include giving greater powers to Holyrood but also to local government and the regions of England.  He is expected to tell delegates: \u0026ldquoA federal Britain, with greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, is the radical solution that I want to see.  \u0026ldquoWe need new powers to reflect the new realities of Brexit, which is why there is a Labour guarantee that devolved powers ing from the European Union will be transferred to the devolved governments and that we will enter a new era of co-determination in a new era of democratic politics.  \u0026ldquoOur task is to reinvigorate politics. It is to build up our movement for democracy and socialism.  A federal Britain is usually seen as Westminster retaining powers over foreign and defence policy as well as UKwide taxes but devolving everything else to parliaments in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England.  However, Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos argument to give greater powers to Edinburgh under a federal system could be seen at odds with his contention yesterday not to allow a second Scottish independence referendum.  Some could argue that creating a federal UK would mean handing over more constitutional powers to the Scottish Parliament, including the ability to hold a referendum on Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos predecessor Kezia Dugdale backed the creation of a federal UK under a new Act of Union. However, Jeremy Corbyn was regarded as being cool on the idea.  Yet in the Labour Party manesto for the 2017 General Election the party promised to establish a constitutional convention  it gained power, which would \u0026ldquolook at extending democracy locally, regionally and nationally, considering the option of a more federalised country.  In January, Lesley Laird, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, also distanced herself from the push for federalism, describing it as an \u0026ldquounhelpful label. She appeared to downplay the prospect that a federal UK would be the final outcome of the planned constitutional convention under a Corbyn premiership.  Asked about federalism, a concept backed by her predecessor as Kirkcaldy MP, Gordon Brown, Ms Laird said: \u0026ldquoThat labelling is unhelpful because  you say to people, \u0026lsquowhat\u0026rsquos federalism?\u0026rsquo they will think about Germany, for example.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos about what appeals to people and a more simple, straightforward way to think about that is to have powers where they most logically sit, where the best decisions can be taken.  In his conference speech today Mr Leonard will also make clear the next UK manesto will include a commitment to oppose a second Scottish independence referendum.  The Scottish Labour leader will tell delegates Scotland does not need another independence referendum rather, it needs a radical UK Labour government.  However, it is still unclear  a future Labour government, while opposing so-called Indyref2, would agree to facilitate one. Last week, Mr Corbyn said he would \u0026ldquonot rule out approving a second vote on Scotland\u0026rsquos future.  Last year, after Holyrood mandated Nicola Sturgeon to call for another independence referendum, the UK party leader made clear it should not be up to Westminster to go against a democratic vote in the Scottish Parliament.  Responding to Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos declaration that Labour would oppose Indyref2, the First Minister tweeted that Labour\u0026rsquos attempt to \u0026ldquoout Tory the Tories on #Indy shows no sign of abating. Which can only be good news for @theSNP."},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy-corbyn-and-senior-colleagues-resist-party-pressure-for-backing-peoples-vote","story":"  Party sources suggested the likely outcome of deliberations on having a vote at the end of a debate on Brexit tomorrow would be a \u0026ldquofudge, which would stress the party\u0026rsquos clear preference for another general election, should Theresa May\u0026rsquos final plan on Britain\u0026rsquos EU withdrawal fail to get the support of MPs later this year.  Any move by the Labour leadership to directly back the so-called People\u0026rsquos Vote \u0026ndash the supporters of which say it should include the option of staying in the EU - would be a reversal of policy, which is simply to keep it on the table.  It would also be a landmark decision in the Brexit process as it would align Labour not only with the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign itself but also the Liberal Democrats.  Mr Corbyn said he was \u0026ldquobound by the democracy of our party but also noted: \u0026ldquoLet\u0027s see what comes out of conference.  His deputy Tom Watson also made clear  party members voted to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, he would support the move.  \"Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour Party back to its members. So,  the people\u0027s party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it,\" he said.  Last night, around 100 Labour delegates were engaged in intense discussions behind closed doors deciding on the key issue of the wording of the Brexit motion to be debated and voted upon.  Earlier, the Labour leader, while he made clear he would support the will of the party  its members decided to back a People\u0026rsquos Vote, stressed he personally believed a general election would be a better way to resolve the political crisis over the nature of the UK\u0027s departure from the EU.  And Len McCluskey, the Unite leader, warned that any second vote on Brexit should not be asking  the public wanted to stay in the EU as proposed by those supporting a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \"We have already had a People\u0027s Vote they voted to come out of the EU,\" declared Mr McCluskey.  At a fringe event last night, he warned: \"We have to be careful about how we play with our democracy.\"  Highlighting the tensions at the top of the party, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Shadow Business Secretary, admitted to having \"reservations\" about backing another vote because, she argued, the Conservative Government \"might be able to skew it in particular directions to secure the result they wanted\".  The Labour leadership, which has always said it respected the 2016 referendum result, is fearful that any open support for a second EU vote, which included the option of reversing that decision, would alienate a swathe of Labour voters, who backed Brexit.  The position of the leadership has been made dficult after a poll found 86 per cent of Labour members thought voters should have the final say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations and 90 per cent said they would now vote to remain in the EU.  Yesterday in Liverpool, thousands of people, including MPs, MEPs, trade union leaders and activists marched through the city and attended a rally, calling for a People\u0026rsquos Vote.  As he addressed the gathering Labour MP David Lammy said: \"Are you listening Jeremy Corbyn?\"  Highlighting how people from across the UK were present, the Tottenham MP said: \"They are saying squarely to the leadership of the Labour Party: \u0027Listen to us, hear us, give us a People\u0027s Vote.\u0027  \"When we have that People\u0027s Vote let us ensure that the option to remain in the EU is on the ballot paper,\" he declared.  A crowd waving EU and other flags chanted \"b*****ks to Brexit\" and \"it\u0027s not a done deal\" as they walked from St George\u0027s Hall in the city centre to the rally at Pier Head, close to where the conference is taking place.  Manuel Cortes, the General Secretary of the TSSA transport union, also backed calls for Labour to support a second referendum on Brexit.  \"The terms of Brexit should be put to the British people,\" he declared, adding: \u0026ldquoPeople voted to leave the European Union but that doesn\u0027t mean buying a pig in the poke or giving the Prime Minister a blank cheque. Whatever she negotiates she needs to bring back to the British people.\"  Last night at a rally at the World Transformed Festival, running alongside the conference, Mr Corbyn said the rich were on \"borrowed time\" as he took aim at their tax breaks and offshore havens.  After receiving a rapturous reception, he told the audience the \"poorest and most vulnerable\" had been forced to pay the price for the 2008 financial crash.  The Labour leader said that winning an election was \"not going to be easy\" but hailed the power of \"popular movements coming together\".  Stressing how challenging neoliberal economics was \u0026ldquofundamental to what we believe in,\" Mr Corbyn added: \"Austerity has been meted out on the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society.  \"They are the ones who paid the price of the banking crisis of 2008, all the time the very richest in our society have had tax breaks, giveaways and tax havens.  \"I tell you what: they are on borrowed time because a Labour government is coming.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Corbyn  39 s final chance to do the right thing over Brexit","story":"  At the other end of the political spectrum Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters have descended upon Liverpool for surely the most important Labour conference in a generation.

Officials from the Humanist Society Scotland and Secular Scotland said denominational schools could even face legal action  they followed the advice.  Earlier this month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish Government intended to incorporate the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into Scots Law.  The a move is signicant because the UN\u0027s Children\u0027s Rights Committee recommended the current right of parents in Scotland to opt out of religious observance should be extended to pupils.  Responding to the suggestion a spokesman for the Catholic Church said: \"Current guidance, allowing pupils to express their views on religious observance, allows them to be given an explanation of the advantages of religious education and religious observance, following which many pupils continue to attend.\"  The spokesman said schools would organise \"purposeful work\" for those pupils who still wanted to opt out.  But he added: \"Parents and pupils who wish to opt out on grounds of conscience are advised that, in order not to contradict their wishes, schools will ensure they are not part of any other religious education and religious observance activities such as religiously-motivated charitable fundraising, Nativity play or feast day celebrations. Very few wish to be excluded in this way from the le of the school.\"  The statement provoked an angry backlash from Gordon MacRae, chief executive of the Scottish Humanist Society, who described it as \u0026ldquodisturbing.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis suggests denominational schools coerce or threaten to isolate children and young people from the school community because of their faith or belief.  \"Following such a course of action would put denominational school headteachers in potentially actionable situations and completely distract them from the professional work they do educating pupils and running inclusive school environments.  \"All schools in Scotland, including denominational ones, have a responsibility under law to respect and uphold the independent human right to freedom of religion and belief.\"  Robert Canning, chair of Secular Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe would not agree that children opted out of religious observance, by themselves or their parents, should automatically be excluded from all activities connected with religion, since not all such activities involve worship or prayer.  \"Children acting in Nativity plays are obviously expressing the outlook of the characters and not their own beliefs, and a child might want to be part of a fundraising effort without having the religious motivation that other participants might claim.\"  Professor Paul Braterman, from the Scottish Secular Society, said: \"Parents and pupils should be allowed to decide for themselves regarding matters such as Nativity plays and Feast Day celebrations, on a case-by-case basis.  Meanwhile, teaching unions welcomed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos intention to incorporate the UN\u0027s convention on children\u0027s rights into Scots Law.  A spokesman for the Educational Institute of Scotland said the union would support the right of children, at a suitable point in their development, to be able to withdraw from religious assemblies  they wished.  He added: \"We would support children at a suitable point in their development having the right to withdraw  they wish and note that Scottish Government guidance makes it clear that in no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.  \"Under the terms of the Equality Act, schools have a legal duty to prevent discrimination against those who hold particular religious or philosophical beliefs and to actively ensure that they have equal opportunity to participate in the le of the school.  \"To actively exclude children from activities which may be religion-related, but which would not be classied as religious observance, is likely to invite strong legal challenge.\"  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"The existing statutory guidance recognises that when a parent chooses a denominational school ... there is an expectation that they have opted into the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice including activities relating to religious faith and observance.  \"Our guidance also states no pupil should be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawal from religious observance.\"  In Scotland, all young people require parental permission to pull out of religious observance, unlike England and Wales where sixth form pupils \u0026ndash typically aged between 16 and 18 \u0026ndash have the right to opt out.  The law which governs religious observance, originally dating from 1872, has not been updated since 1980 and the latest guidance from the Scottish Government was issued in 2011.  The guidance states: \"Where a parent chooses a denominational school for their child\u0026rsquos education, they choose to opt in to the school\u0026rsquos ethos and practice which is imbued with religious faith and religious observance.  \"In denominational schools, it is therefore more dficult to extricate a pupil from all experiences which are influenced by the school\u0026rsquos faith character.  \"Where a pupil is withdrawn from religious observance schools should make suitable arrangements for the pupil to participate in a worthwhile alternative activity. In no circumstances should a pupil be disadvantaged as a result of withdrawing from religious observance.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-says-any-peoples-vote-should-not-include-option-of-britain-staying-in-eu","story":"  Pro-EU activists\u0027 hopes of the party fully throwing its weight behind a People\u0026rsquos Vote suffered a major setback at Labour\u0027s conference in Liverpool.  More than 100 constituency parties submitted motions demanding a second referendum and thousands of people joined a march calling for a so-called People\u0027s Vote in order to put pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to change course.  But, as expected, after a marathon \u0026ldquocompositing session on Sunday night, the exact wording of the motion to be put to a vote at the party\u0027s conference tomorrow states only that \" we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".  This is effectively a restatement of the leadership\u0026rsquos position.  However, John McDonnell, a key ally of the party leader, went further this morning by making clear that  there were any second referendum, it should be on whether or not to accept a Brexit deal or conduct fresh negotiations with Brussels rather than seek to reverse the 2016 decision to leave the EU.  The Shadow Chancellor explained: \"We argued for Remain in the past but we lost that vote so we have to respect that. All the polling that we have seen is that the country is still pretty split down the middle.  \u0026ldquoMy big worry is that  we go for a referendum which is seen as just a simple re-run we could ide the country again, we could get almost the same result or  it\u0027s slightly dferent that people demand another referendum.\"  He noted how the 2016 poll \"opened up all sorts of xenophobic feelings and a rise of the Right\" and stressed: \"I don\u0027t want to revive Ukip in any way or even the far Right\".  The precise wording of the referendum question would be a matter for Parliament, Mr McDonnell pointed out, telling BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"If we are going to respect the referendum, it[a People\u0027s Vote] will be about the deal.\"  On Good Morning Britain he suggested that a general election would be \"the real People\u0027s Vote\" because it would give the public the chance to change the team carrying out the negotiations, replacing Theresa May with a Labour government.  But he acknowledged the debate at the conference \"may be rumbustious\".  Labour MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, was not best pleased, saying it would be \"farcical\" to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU.  \"A People\u0027s Vote is the only realistic option to save this country from the car crash of Brexit, declared the London MP.  \"No Tory or DUP MP is likely to vote for a general election. Turkeys do not tend to vote for Christmas.\"  He added: \"We\u0027ve now got to turn up the noise until we secure a public vote which gives us the option to remain in the UK.\"  Mr Lammy received support from his Labour colleague and fellow Remainer Chuka Umunna, who called for an \"unequivocal\" commitment to a second referendum with remaining in the EU as an option.  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said, by ruling out the option of Britain staying in the EU in a second referendum, the Labour leadership was aiding and abetting Theresa May on Brexit.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove spent two years backing the Tories\u0026rsquo catastrophic Brexit and are even now trying to ignore their own members who want a People\u0026rsquos Vote with the option to remain in the EU.  \u0026ldquoIt beggars belief that McDonnell and Co are spending so much time trying to trick and stitch up their own conference rather than campaigning for an exit from Brexit to protect jobs and services in the UK.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe only choice a \u0026lsquodeal or no deal\u0026rsquo vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at. Liberal Democrats demand better than Brexit and want to give the people the final say on any deal through a People\u0027s Vote where they will have the option to remain in the EU.  Eloise Todd of pro-EU Best for Britain said it would be \"unthinkable\" for a second vote not to include the option of Britain staying in the EU and was \"not what the 90 per cent of Labour members who back a public vote would expect\".  She added: \"Labour must listen to its members on this and the vast majority of its voters. It\u0026rsquos time for a final say with the option to stay.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-mcdonnell-denies-workers-shareholding-plan-would-lead-to-less-investment","story":"  The Shadow Chancellor took to the airwaves to promote Labour\u0026rsquos new plan, saying: \"If you look at other economies, like Germany, where there\u0027s been much more worker involvement, it\u0027s been the reverse.  \"You get more investment, you get longer-term decision-making and you have a growing economy.

Conference is expected to back a rule change to create having a female deputy leader to work alongside the current deputy Tom Watson, leading to speculation that when Mr Corbyn stands down, he will be succeeded by a woman.  The Shadow Chancellor told Today: \"The next leader of the Labour party has to be a woman.\"  Changes to rules governing leadership elections and selection of MP candidates have been approved at conference.  Members and unions voted 63.94 per cent for and 36.06 per cent against the changes to the leadership rules and 65.32 per cent for and 34.68 per cent against the changes to selection of MP candidates.  Under the reselection rule change, the threshold to force sitting MPs to fight open selection battles will be cut from 50 to 33 per cent of local branches or affiliated unions.  Labour MPs currently face a so-called \"trigger ballot\" before each general election but must fight against other contenders for the candidacy only  a majority of local branches and affiliated unions back an open selection contest.  The new change will require an open contest  either 33 per cent of local party branches or 33 per cent of affiliated trade union branches demand one.  The rule change for future leadership contests does not alter the 10 per cent threshold for the number of MPs\u0027 nominations which a candidate must gather to get on to the ballot paper but also requires would-be leaders to secure nominations from fiver per cent of constituency parties or five per cent of members of trade unions or affiliated organisations."},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie campaign to be discussed at holyrood","story":"        The Save Bennachie Alliance will head to the Scottish Parliament this week to discuss its campaign.

His parents, Josiah and Margaret , had lost 11 children in infancy.Josiah had two spells as provost of Wick and succeeded Robert Innes of Thrumster as agent for the Commercial Bank.

He argued for the inclusion of a broch as an example of native architecture as part of the Great Exhibition and wrote a paper advocating the extension of treasure trove to objects other than precious materials.His failing health took him to warmer climes, where he studied and published extensively.He bequeathed a number of legacies to his native Wick, including the establishment of an institute \"for the industrial training of young women\" at Rhind House, and provided for two scholarships at Edinburgh University.Monday 24 Sep 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Blackmail claims over mums to be","story":"A WHISTLEBLOWER at Raigmore Hospital has alleged that midwives were \u0026ldquoblackmailed into taking on patients from Elgin in order to prevent Caithness mums-to-be from travelling to Glasgow to give birth.The midwe, whose identity has been concealed on request as the person is contracted to NHS Highland, said that due to maternity services at Dr Gray\u0026rsquos Hospital in Elgin being downgraded, expectant mums in Moray had to travel to Inverness to give birth.A large percentage of women in Caithness also have to travel to Raigmore.The additional workload from Elgin has led to anger among midwery staff who are also aggrieved that pregnant Caithness women were allegedly used as a bargaining chip.The whistle-blower said: \u0026ldquoThe maternity services at Elgin were downgraded and that meant an influx of new patients on top of the ones we already have from Caithness.\u0026ldquoWe made it clear to management that we were overworked as it is and a new batch of expectant mums would increase that even further.\u0026ldquoWe asked  they could be erted to Aberdeen but we were told  we refused to take on Elgin patients then the Caithness ones would be removed from our workload.\u0026ldquoEssentially, that meant that women would have to travel all the way from Caithness to Glasgow in order to give birth.\u0026ldquoWe did not want that to happen and we reluctantly took on the extra workload.\u0026ldquoThis comes at a time of year when all the Christmas surprises come into the world.

Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash  it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him ing to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Aslearson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being kned in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops. A bishop got his eyes put out in Scrabster.\u0026ldquoAfter the bishop was murdered at Halkirk, the Scottish king came up here and carried out what was, for want of a better description, pure genocide of the people from the Halkirk area. I believe they were all massacred round about where the Pennyland estate is now in Thurso. Hundreds of people were killed there.\u0026ldquoIn those days you just didn\u0026rsquot go burning bishops \u0026ndash they\u0026rsquore going to come down heavy on you.\u0026ldquoRavenshill Road used to be known as the Gallows Hill, before the atomic houses were built there, so that has been a place for judicial executions for quite a long time.From the machinations of the \u0026ldquofemme fatale Ragnhild at Murkle to the murder of Earl Rognvald at Forsie to the Battle of Clairdon Hill outside Thurso, the power struggles and manoeuvrings come thick and fast. It\u0026rsquos a rapid-fire history lesson, but more than anything Cassells simply wants people to enjoy the stories.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a thing I never learned in school here. It was never mentioned, he says. \u0026ldquoThis is our own local history, and I just hope people think it\u0026rsquos a good read.The Katanes Saga  is self-published and is on sale in Caithness Horizons, newsagents in Thurso, and Wick Heritage Museum.Monday 24 Sep 2018 12:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117588.jpg","title":"Preloved pet trade blasted","story":"\u0026nbspA CAITHNESS-based animal rights campaigner is calling for a change in the law to stop \"heartless\" pet owners from selling unwanted animals online.Natalie Oag, who is backing a proposal by the Scottish Government for the introduction of a special licence for dog owners, says animals listed on sites such as Preloved are the victims of a \"throwaway society\".\"Pets shouldn\u0027t be viewed the same as inanimate objects when no longer wanted,\" said Ms Oag, the Highland representative for the Peta Foundation .Pets listed on Preloved include a 9ft python available for \u0026pound1000 and, until a few days ago, a heavily muscled eight-month-old \"untrained\" micro pocket American bulldog for \u0026pound2000 \u0026ndash listed as it did not get along with another dog.Other listings include a sheepdog which \"adores humans\" but is not interested in sheep, while on Gumtree \u0026ndash which has recently imposed a \u0026pound2.99 fee to deter \"casual\" trading \u0026ndash pets for sale include an 18-month-old cat looking for a \"stable\" household, a pair of two-year-old \"very tame\" rabbits and a one-year-old cat whose owner claims to have developed a skin allergy.It is not illegal to post adverts and sell pets online.

The awards run across the UK with winners expected to be announced in November.Carolyn Wilson, who runs a local business and is also a Cromarty Firth ward councillor, said the town was \"buzzing\" after the shortlisting, which pits the town against bids from Glasgow, Kirriemuir, Kirkwall, Newport-on-Tay and Turrf.Mrs Wilson said: \"There\u0026rsquos a real feelgood factor.

They worried that the business case for the cinema and hub was not sufficient and risked adding to the number of empty buildings in Cromarty.Others argued that the project would be out of keeping with Cromarty\u0026rsquos historic architecture.A report which went before this week\u0026rsquos committee said that Cromarty Community Council had taken a neutral stance over the proposals, but that a consultation it held with the public found that, out of 63 residents who responded, 37 supported the plans and 26 were opposed.Recommending approval council planners said existing paths through the site would be maintained and added that the location within an area that is already fenced off meant there was a \"perceptible distinction\" between the yard site and wider Links area.They added that the film society had looked at other existing venues for a possible cinema and found none were suitable, and added that Cromarty Estate had argued there was \"a demand from local groups and businesses for office space\".Voting unanimously in favour of the plans, a number of councillors on the committee said it was an exciting project but also acknowledged some of the local reservations over the business case.Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Margaret Paterson said that while some in the community had doubts over the cinema\u0026rsquos financial viability, she stressed that \"the film society is active and forward-thinking and they will get the people\".Wick and East Caithness councillor Raymond Bremner also acknowledged local fears that the community might be left with \"dficult buildings\"  the development didn\u0026rsquot \"quite work\" but praised the application and gave his support to it.And Dingwall and Seaforth councillor Angela Maclean said she believed the hub and cinema was \"a venue that can be used by lots of dferent groups in the community\" and would boost the neighbouring Slaughterhouse Cafe.\"This is an exciting development for Cromarty \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos a cosmopolitan and very artistic community,\" she added.Monday 24 Sep 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

They\u0026rsquove travelled all over Scotland to skate parks elsewhere but there\u0026rsquos never been anything closer to home in Ullapool.\"Two years ago we got a loan of portable skate park equipment owned by Highland Council. It was located on the tennis court at Lochbroom Leisure Centre and was well-used but eventually it had to move on somewhere else.\"At the start of this year, there was an announcement that there would be a local discretionary fund to bid in to. That made me think it was worth trying to get something moving. Around 30 groups gave presentations. My son gave a presentation at the end of the day about the plans for equipment and we were successful getting the maximum \u0026pound2500 available.\"Ullapool Harbour trust also chipped in \u0026pound1000 to the cause.The group set itself an initial target of \u0026pound7000. It then submitted a bid for lottery funding of \u0026pound7500, which it has just been awarded.\u0026nbspIt\u0026rsquos hoped the new equipment could again be located in the tennis court for part of the year.Mr Crook said: \"It\u0026rsquos a facility that was well-received. The company that provides the equipment does a number of layouts so it\u0026rsquos a question of deciding what we can afford and then placing an order. It will, I\u0026rsquom sure, be very well used.\"Monday 24 Sep 2018 12:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Production has exceeded expectations since it started in November 2017 and is currently producing around 40,000 boepd, with an estimated field le of 15 years.“This transaction builds on our Boa oil field acquisition in 2017 and our acquisition of interests in the Alba oil field and the Babbage gas field earlier this year.

Brian Ferguson meets the team behind Long Shadows \u0026#8211 including the latest Rebus \u0026#8211 ahead of its Scottish run                It has been more than 30 years since Inspector Rebus cracked his first case.            Now Ian Rankin is preparing for the prospect of seeing his creation in the flesh for the first time.            Fans of the grizzled Edinburgh detective will be able to see him in a whole new light from this week when the character finally makes his stage debut.Long Shadows, the first Rebus story to be penned with another writer, has seen Rankin collaborate with Rona Munro, the Aberdeen-born playwright best known for her epic historical trilogy The James Plays. The show, which will premiere at Birmingham Rep tonight before a King’s Theatre run on Rebus’s home turf next month, is not only a brand new Rebus story. Devotees of the retired detective will also get the chance to see him lock horns on stage with his long-time nemesis, Maurice “Big Ger” Cafferty.The characters will be brought to le by Coronation Street veteran Charlie Lawson, the Northern Irish actor known to millions of viewers as Jim McDonald, and Scottish Game of Thrones star John Stahl, with award-winning actress Cathy Tyson, who shot to fame in film debut Mona Lisa, playing Rebus’s long-time sidekick Siobhan Clarke.Long Shadows is Rankin’s second venture into the world of theatre after writing Dark Road, which Rebus was noticeably absent from, for the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh five years ago with then artistic director, Mark Thomson.             Rankin and Munro, who had never previously met, began working together on a story after the author was approached by London-based producer Daniel Schumann with the idea of a Rebus stage play.Rankin says: “I felt it would be an awful lot of work and didn’t feel confident writing for the stage on my own, but told him I would be happy doing it with someone else.“He mentioned Rona Munro to me. I was a huge fan of her work like The James Plays, but didn’t know her at all. We met up a few times and got on like a house on fire. “She was a fan of the books, which helped, but we decided early on that we didn’t want to adapt any of them.             “You can tie yourself up in knots trying to adapt something that wasn’t specically written for the stage. The Rebus novels usually have 30-odd characters, three or four twisty sub-plots and are hundreds of pages long.“I came up with the outline of a story and we would go for cups of tea and lunches and just brainstorm it. Once we had what we thought was the right plot she went away and did the dialogue.”Munro, whose previous stage plays include The Last Witch, about the last woman to be executed in Britain, and has written Doctor Who stories for TV, jumped at the chance to work with Rankin. She says: “My mother was a monster Ian Rankin fan. I resisted reading them for such a long time. I always felt I was such a disappointment in comparison!“Crime is a genre that I enjoy reading, but I’m picky. The ones I like I absolutely love, but there is an awful lot of rubbish out there.            “But Ian writes proper novels and Rebus is such a complicated character. If you read the books you get the opportunity to follow him over all those years and I think that’s part of the attraction. I actually went back and re-read all the novels which featured Cafferty in preparation for working on the play.“I’ve never done anything like this, which is writing in another writer’s style with another writer’s characters.“The writing of it was over a year ago, but it felt quite easy at the time, I think because I had someone else’s plot to lean on. I can do dialogue and character any day of the week, but having a tight plot is something I struggle with. It was a bit of a dream in that sense.”Long Shadows, which is described by Rankin as a “psychodrama,” sees Rebus and Cafferty thrust together again after the daughter of a murder victim turns up on the doorstep of the retired detective, who has been investigating cold cases for several years.Rankin explains: “I really like the idea of a crime that has happened in the past suddenly rearing its head again in the present.“There’s some unfinished business between Rebus and Cafferty over an old case and an investigation Siobhan is working brings it to light again, which leads to Rebus and Cafferty locking horns.“It is really a psychological game, with these two heavyweights kind of dancing around each other.“I love the idea of being able to see Rebus in the flesh and actually be physically in the same room as him, especially to see him slugging it out with Cafferty. “They are two big meaty roles – two men who are at a certain point in their lives where they are starting to ask big questions about what is left for them and their place in the world.”Lawson adds: “Rebus and Cafferty’s ‘friendship’ has been built up over 25 years. They’re very much like Holmes and Moriarty. You can see there is grudging respect for each other, but by the same token they are also battling like two bulls in a ring.”Lawson freely admits he has come to the role without reading any of Rankin’s novels and knowing nothing about the character.But the 59-year-old is more than familiar with Rebus’s home city – and his favourite watering hole – since his first visit early 40 years ago.“I have actually known the Oxford Bar since 1979.“My cousin Sandy, who was actually my best mate as well, lived on Heriot Row and used to drink in all these haunts like the Ox, the Hebrides and the West End Hotel. I remember Willie Ross, the landlord of the Ox, didn’t allow any women in the bar and would quite easily fling people out at the drop of a hat.“I met loads of retired police officers there. It was full of very smart alcoholics who did The Scotsman crossword.“I appeared at the Assembly Rooms during the Edinburgh Festival in 1981 in a show called Diary of a Hunger Strike and have been to Edinburgh many, many times, since then – it’s honestly my favourite city in the world.”Lawson concedes that all he knew about the character of Rebus when he was offered the part in the play, without the need for an audition, was that he had been played by John Hannah and Ken Stott in the TV incarnations of some of Rankin’s early novels.He adds: “It was one of those things that was a ‘yes’ straight away. You don’t turn something like this down. You need to really challenge yourself now and again as an actor.“I’m quite glad I was unfamiliar with the character. You don’t want to bring baggage like that with you to a role. I approached it with a blank sheet of paper from day one. I’m right in the thick of it now.“The complexities of Rebus are obvious. We’re not doing some existential piece. His faults are all there, warts and all, from page one.”Rankin is at pains to point out to his fans that the new play is set in a “parallel world” to the one created in his novels.He adds: “There are basically going to be two audiences – people who know and love Rebus and people who just want a good night out at the theatre and might never have read any of the books.“It slots into the Rebus universe. You get a bit more of Cafferty’s back story and a bit more of Rebus’s working relationship with Siobhan Clarke.“It’s a really great cast and \u2028it will hopefully bring in people who know them but might \u2028not know me. I might get a few new fans out of it, you never know.”A LIFE OF CRIME: REBUS IN PRINT AND ON SCREENInspector John Rebus made his debut in Ian Rankin’s second novel, Knots and Crosses, which was published in March 1987.The Fe-born author had begun writing novels while he was supposed to be working towards a PhD in Scottish literature at Edinburgh University.Rankin was said to have been surprised that the first Rebus thriller was classied as crime fiction when he had set out to write a modern-day version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.Rankin has admitted Rebus was actually killed off in the first draft of Knots and Crosses and he was persuaded by his publisher to revive the character in another novel.The character has appeared in a further 20 novels since then, despite an apparent swan song more than a decade ago in Exit Music, which signalled his official retirement from the force.However, after a five-year hiatus, Rankin has gone on to revive the character in another four novels, which have seen Rebus help serving detectives to investigate unresolved “cold cases.”As well as the new stage play, Rankin is about to publish a brand new Rebus novel, In a House of Lies.More than 30 million Rebus novels are believed to have been sold around the world, while the books have been translated into 36 dferent languages to date.The most recent Rebus novel, Rather be the Devil, topped the best-seller charts for hardback fiction when it was released in November 2016. New Rebus novels are said to sell as many as half a million copies within just a few months of printing.Rankin, his publisher Orion and the Edinburgh International Book Festival marked the 30th anniversary of the detective last year by staging a three-day festival in the character’s home city.The first “RebusFest” included masterclasses, workshops, tours, live music and film events, and an exhibition of rarely-seen archive material.Rankin’s novels have previously been adapted for television by STV Productions, with John Hannah and then Ken Stott playing the leading role.However production was brought to a halt in 2008 amid reports Stott had decided he did not want to continue in the role.It was announced last year that Gregory Burke, the writer of the hit plays Gagarin Way and Black Watch, was working on a new “contemporary adaptation” of Rebus for TV. Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival this year, Rankin revealed that a much younger actor than Stott was likely to play the role when Rebus s to the nation’s TV screens. The character was said to be 40 when he first appeared in Knots and Crosses.Other actors to play Rebus include Ron Donachie, who starred as the detective in Radio 4’s dramatisations of some of the novels, while James MacPherson, who is best-known for his long-running role in Taggart, has narrated audiobook versions of the novels.Rankin, who was awarded the OBE in 2002 for services to literature, has been the recipient of honorary degrees from the universities of Abertay, St Andrews, Hull and Edinburgh.Rebus: Long Shadows opens at Birmingham Rep tonight, and will be at the King’s Theatre, Edinburgh from 8-13 October www.capitaltheatres and His Majesty’s Theatre in Aberdeen from 12-17 November www.aberdeenperformingarts.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4802813.1537437079!/image/image.jpg","title":"massive tapestry depicting games of thrones goes on display in glasgow","story":"        A huge Game of Thrones embroidery commissioned by the producers of the series has gone on display at a university in Glasgow.

The question is does she have the wherewithal to do it? If recent experience is anything to go by I have to conclude she will yet again let her best opportunities pass her by.            The prime minister is now playing a patriotic card, wrapping herself up in the union flag and banging the drum about how the country has been insulted and made fun of by her erstwhile continental friends from across the water – when all along she has shown nothing but the utmost respect for the EU negotiating team, and the leaders of the EU and EU member countries.            She is receiving a good deal of sympathy as a result – for it is blatantly obvious the gratuitous behaviour of Donald Tusk and President Emmanuel Macron are only two examples of an especially condescending and arrogant cabal. With Angela Merkel taking an unusually low profile the photographed behaviour of these dark suited men towards the isolated May in her red jacket was verging on the chauvinistic,  not misogynistic.The patriotic card is however an all to obvious ruse to satisfy domestic political concerns rather than change the nature of the negotiation with the EU. It is an attempt to present the Prime Minister as a strong, wronged, woman – striking three chords of sympathy on the British people’s psyche. Yet we know that the prime minister – for all her brave words – has been supine rather than strong due to her many unnecessary compromises. She has wronged her own supporters only to become isolated, as she has now been hung out to dryThe British prime minister was warned by members of her party at all levels that her Chequers Plan would not be acceptable to the EU leaders and that it would only encourage them to hold out for further demands. These warnings came from the cabinet members who had resigned after being intentionally and cruelly humiliated by the imposition of her unnecessary and unpopular negotiation position that had been developed secretly in parallel to the government’s official working papers. There were existing cabinet members who also had grave doubts about the Chequers Plan – and there were many Conservative MPs from both the Europhile-Remain and Eurosceptic-Leave wings of the backbenches who voiced there public opposition.  An attempt by Conservative Party officials to win round constituency members and office-bearers received a brusque and robust retort. And we know from polling of the top 44 Conservative marginal seats that was published before she went to Salzburg that the public dislike her Chequers Plan enough to lose her party every single one of those seats.            There was in fact no signicant constituency of supporters of the Chequers Plan other than the prime minister’s retinue and the EU used this weakness to diminish her in public.Yet out of her vainglorious defeat there is still an opportunity to recover, save face and come out as the winner. First it requires her to publicly admit that the well-meant Chequers Plan is now a sorry episode in the past and that an alternative will be found. It was a mistake to say there was no alternative to Chequers when there plainly was – for lies will be found out, and it was.We know there is an alternative because the original papers of the former Brexit Secretary, David Davis, that met the conditions of the prime minister’s own speeches at Lancaster House, in Florence and at Mansion House and are available in the public domain. It was also a mistake to by the Prime Minister to invest so much of her reputation in Chequers, for with its rejection she has been badly wounded. She must in future broaden her support across her party, but more importantly across the broader Leave movement and those Leavers who are of other parties or none.            Fortunately for the Prime Minister the Institute of Economic Affairs will today publish a new high-level proposal that could become the basis for a unying negotiating position. Called “Plan A+” it will seek to pull together the central tenets of having a new trading relationship with the EU while taking back control of the country’s laws, taxes and borders. It will provide answers to the needless calls for a further referendum on any deal, for so long as the UK Government delivers on what it said it would do in its manesto – and was backed in that respect by Labour too, namely leaving the EU’s single market and Customs Union – then it has the legal and moral mandate to deliver the deal it thinks best, or no deal  that is better than anything on offer.Having a plan will also kill the ridiculous idea that she should seek to call a snap election. Parliament would have to agree to call an election but why would there be a majority for that when she is such a poor campaigner and does not have a credible negotiating plan to campaign on?Fortunately the prime minister can take solace and gain hope in the fact that the Labour opposition cannot decide what course to take regarding Brexit. Corbyn is in deep trouble over the idea of a second referendum, or indeed any attempt to block Brexit. A weekend poll of its top 25 constituencies showed that such is the public discontent with its constant dodging from one position to another – so long as its newly adopted line might force a general election – could lose it nineteen seats in a general election. Some 58 per cent of voters in those Labour marginals just want Brexit to be delivered while only 22 per cent support a second referendum. What potential Labour voters think is far more important than the views of Labour Party members, even more so in the seats the party must retain and those it must win.            With a party conference to convince that she deserves another chance of delivering a meaningful Brexit that respects both what her party campaigned in the elections for – and what the vast majority of the people voted for across ious parties – Theresa May first must “chuck Chequers”. If she remains in denial and cannot bring herself to do it then the party can only conclude she is not made of the right stuff for the job in hand.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804105.1537696669!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotsman editor frank o donnell trust matters and impartial journalism is vital","story":"        Online news reporting offers many temptations to sacrice quality in the race for audience.

It comes as Labour MSPs were urged to help fund her defence against a defamation action brought by Stuart Campbell, with Jackie Baillie calling on fellow Holyrood parliamentarians to contribute £100 per month.            Mr Campbell took Ms Dugdale to court after she accused him of posting “homophobic” tweets.            The blogger had written on social media about a Conservative MSP, saying: “Oliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner.”Mr Mundell’s father is Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who came out in 2016.In a newspaper column, Ms Dugdale – at the time, Scottish Labour’s first and only openly gay parliamentarian – wrote that she was “shocked and appalled” by the comments.Her legal fees are believed to be in excess of £90,000. Earlier this month a sherf rejected a call from Ms Dugdale’s lawyers for the case to be dismissed, and ordered a hearing of evidence.A motion put forward by the Glasgow Anniesland constituency party for debate at the Labour conference in Liverpool states that “a promise was made by the party to support Kezia Dugdale in this action from start to finish in connection with her legal defence”.            Paul Cruikshank, the secretary of Anniesland CLP told The Scotsman: “This isn’t about isions in the Labour party – members on all sides are supporting Kezia and want the party to change is decision.“There are lots of SNP supporters and independence supporters who also think Wings Over Scotland should be challenged.”Mr Campbell has accused the former Scottish Labour leader of telling “appalling, cowardly and mendacious lies” about his views. At a hearing at Edinburgh Sherf Court in July, his QC Craig Sandison said it was “simply not true” to call Mr Campbell a homophobe. Lord Foulkes, for whom Ms Dugdale worked before being elected as an MSP, welcomed the call for MSPs to help cover he legal costs.            He told the Herald on Sunday: “In principle, Jackie Baillie has come up with a good idea, and  MSPs paid this sum, I am sure MPs and peers would also contribute. My only worry is that it gets [UK Labour general secretary] Jennie Formby off the hook as we should keep the pressure up on the party.

Mrs May and the Home Secretary Sajid Javid are believed to support the removal of any special status for EU nationals, to create a “level playing field” with migrants from other parts of the world, while the Chancellor Philip Hammond supports maintaining business access to European labour.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab dismissed claims that Mrs May could call a snap general election following the EU’s rejection of her Brexit strategy as “for the birds”.Reports yesterday suggested senior aides in Downing Street had discussed the possibility of calling an election to break the deadlock in Brussels and within Mrs May’s party over her Chequers plan for post-Brexit trade“It’s for the birds. It’s not going to happen,” he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.Mr Raab said the Government would keep negotiating with the EU on the basis of the Chequers proposals.            “This is a bump in the road. We will hold our nerve, we will keep our cool and we will keep negotiating in good faith,” he said.“What we are not going to do is be dictated to. The UK is one of the biggest economies in Europe,  not in the world.“We have come up with a serious set of proposals. We are not just going to flit from plan to plan like some sort of diplomatic butterfly. We are going to be resolute about this.”Earlier Mrs May issued an appeal to warring Tories to come together to prevent the opposition parties derailing the whole Brexit process.            She claimed that “many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step and seeking to exploit this moment for political gain”.The Prime Minister said: “This is the moment to put our country first. “This is the moment to set aside our dferences and come together in national unity. “This is the moment to do what is right for Britain.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4804236.1537738647!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch the tide is turning against dup leader arlene foster","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The woman behind the turmoil of Brexit is facing her biggest test tomorrow \u0026#8211 not Theresa May but Arlene Foster.                 The DUP leader made weekend headlines in the Brexit-supporting UK press, heaping praise on Theresa May’s demand for more respect from the EU after the Salzburg summit debacle.            But back in Northern Ireland, Ms Foster is about to face fireworks of her own – summoned to re-appear before an inquiry about the heating scandal that almost collapsed her government and could have cost the Northern Ireland taxpayer half-a-billion pounds.            The DUP leader first appeared before the “cash-for-ash” inquiry in April, but her earlier account will now face far greater scrutiny in light of contradictory evidence from witnesses like Jonathan Bell, minister at the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment which oversaw the Renewable Heat Incentive  scheme until May 2016.The RHI scheme was intended to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to green alternatives like biomass but the cost to the taxpayer spiralled out of control as firms realised how lucrative the incentives were. The scandal caused a political row which culminated in the resignation of deputy first minister Martin McGuinness in January 2017 and the collapse of the power-sharing government at Stormont. So the ramications of this week’s evidence for Arlene Foster’s position as DUP leader are enormous.Earlier this month Jonathan Bell told the inquiry that he described the scheme to Northern Ireland’s First Minister as “folly” but that she “ordered” him to keep it open so she could consult further with industry.The former Stormont Minister told the inquiry: “I thought that was totally unreasonable because we had a scheme that was out of control.”  Mr Bell completed his two days of evidence by saying he had sacriced his political career to stop the overspend. “My only motivation was those hundreds of millions of pounds to get back into the health service and our education system.” It was damning stuff. But damning enough to topple a formidably tough politician? Many expect that despite being obviously complicit in mismanagement and perhaps corruption, Arlene Foster will brazen her way through. But her authority will be further weakened – recently an opinion poll found DUP supporters were amongst the 52% of NI voters who now prefer re-unication to a hard Brexit. According to the popular Stephen Nolan Show on BBC Radio Ulster, a DUP source said the pro-Brexit leader is in a “dark place” because of the RHI scandal and it was “50/50” whether she will continue as party leader.            But Arlene Foster’s dficulties don’t just arise from the heating scandal. According to Leave voting commentator Alex Kane writing in the unionist Newsletter: “Brexit, demographics, the rise of Sinn Fein, the loss of the unionist majority in the assembly, almost two years without a government, and the looming celebration of NI’s centenary in 2021. Any one of those issues represents a major challenge collectively, they represent a full-scale assault. So, it seems essential to me that we have a strong leader. I’m just not sure that Arlene Foster is now that leader. I think her responses and throwaway lines have actually galvanised broad-based nationalism and pushed new votes into Sinn Fein’s camp.”Commentators outside the Unionist tradition are also critical. Journalist and author Malachi O’Doherty says: “The greatest outrage is that Theresa May takes Arlene Foster as speaking for the whole of NI, yet her party speaks for one third of the Electorate in a region which voted Remain. We have cards we could be playing now, in support of that Remain vote: our semi detached membership of the UK, our right to vote ourselves back into the EU through a border poll, the fact we retain the right to EU citizenship after Brexit with Irish passports, and the chance to construct an argument for a referendum on Special Status inside the EU. Yet none of these arguments is being advanced.” You could add to the charge sheet Arlene Foster’s support for Northern Ireland’s draconian abortion laws, which the UK Supreme Court say breaches the human rights of women, and her decision not to meet Pope Francis in Dublin this summer or send a party representative in her place.In short, public opinion on Northern Ireland’s social and constitutional future seems to be changing rapidly, but its political leader is not for turning, changing or listening.             What has that got to do with Theresa May, Brexit and prospects for Scottish Independence? Arlene Foster’s intransigence has bound the hands of the Prime Minister so that she is also unable to adapt her position on the core question of Ireland and the border – unless of course the Tory leader frees herself from the troublesome DUP connection via a November general election.Weekend rumours about that strategy show how desperate Theresa May’s post-Salzburg position has become, mainly because of Arlene Foster’s absolute opposition to a border in the North Sea.But can ditching the DUP resolve Theresa May’s Brexit impasse? Not really. The Irish border is the most dficult problem, but the core Brexit deal is still stymied by Britain’s desire to have single market access without accepting freedom of movement. That circle simply cannot be squared, whatever happens to the Irish border. Of course, there’s also a very high chance that another snap general election will result in a Labour or a Labour plus SNP victory. Naturally Jeremy Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon are giving little away at the moment. As politicians it makes sense for them to wait and watch the Tories disintegrate before making a move. But SNP involvement in any future Labour government would have to be based on calling off or postponing Brexit and giving Scotland an opt-out or a second independence referendum.That may be why the UK Labour leader didn’t rule out such a vote last week, even though Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has backed himself into the absurd position of arguing that a new UK manesto will veto indyref2 in all circumstances. Of course  Nicola Sturgeon is in a power-sharing situation on the back of a another general election, and demands anything less from Labour, her own supporters will be acutely disappointed. In short, all eyes should be on Belfast tomorrow as the first domino unlocking Brexit potentially tumbles.        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4797314.1536524678!/image/image.jpg","title":"v a dundee boss especially proud of mackintosh oak room","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        The director of the new V\u0026ampA Dundee has said he is \u0026#8220especially proud\u0026#8221 of the conservation and restoration of  Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026#8217s original Oak Room.                The Kengo Kuma-designed building will open on Saturday, the striking centrepiece of the continuing £1 billion regeneration of Dundee’s waterfront.            More than a decade after the idea of opening a V\u0026ampA in Scotland’s fourth city was first discussed, director Philip Long spoke of the challenges – and the “thrill” – of setting up the design museum as it prepares to welcome the public.            The museum’s Scottish Design Galleries celebrate the influence of design at home and abroad, from Beano artwork to Hunter wellies and the Fair Isle jumper.The jewel in the crown is Mackintosh’s Oak Room – the painstakingly reconstructed interior of part of Miss Cranston’s Ingram Street Tea Rooms – which has been unseen for 50 years.Mr Long, who came to the V\u0026ampA Dundee from the National Galleries of Scotland, admits that laying his eyes on the exhibit for the first time was an emotional moment.He said: “It’s one of his great, but lost to view, interiors that is now complete and in the museum.“It brings back to public view after nearly 50 years – in fact it’s 70 years since it was used as a tea room – one of this great architect and designer’s works.            “I can tell you, it is a thrilling, quite emotional thing to walk in and see after all of these years.”The interior is on long-term loan following discussions with Glasgow Museums several years ago.Mr Long said: “The thing I’m especially proud of is the conservation and restoration of this original Mackintosh room.“Mackintosh is, after all, one of the world’s greatest architects and designers and happens to be part of Scotland’s design heritage.            “When we set about developing the Scottish Design Galleries, one of the things we needed to ensure was to represent Mackintosh as part of the work we were doing.”Museum bosses anticipate high volumes of visitors and entry over the opening weekend is reserved for those who have prebooked tickets.Access is otherwise free and non-ticketed, with the exception of big touring exhibitions. The first, Ocean Liners: Speed and Style, looks at the design and cultural impact of cruise ships and travel.Mr Long said: “There have been lots of challenges along the way and I’m very pleased and proud that we’ve seen our way through those.“The biggest challenge has been the magnitude of the project overall.            “V\u0026ampA Dundee is not an outstation of the V\u0026ampA in London. As one of the founding partners, V\u0026ampA is a core part, but we here in Dundee are a new team that has come together to develop this project and lead it long into the future.”The question has been asked why the V\u0026ampA chose Dundee to set up home, but Mr Long suggests it was the city that chose the V\u0026ampA. Representatives from the University of Dundee got the ball rolling in 2007, suggesting to the museum that it might like to be part of the waterfront regeneration.Mr Long said: “Dundee really gets the importance of cultural facilities and activities as part of the le of its citizens. That’s been clear over the last 20 years through the investment in new organisations like Dundee Contemporary Arts, or whether it’s the ongoing success of places like Dundee Rep Theatre or the Science Centre or the redevelopment of the McManus.“All of these things demonstrated to the leadership here that investment in culture is the right thing to do. All of that helped set the scene.”        \t            \t            \t©2018\u0026nbspJohnston Publishing Ltd..\u0026nbspCookie Settings\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder  the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder  takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary  to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on  it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble.

Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and  you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely dferent.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the  and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit  ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great inidual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the ing Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe  Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt  anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed,  anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers  I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds  dficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval.

The excellent work done by Barrister Mark Bassett covers EU and Irish law and is unambiguous - with political will, this can be done,\" she said. \nMartina Anderson said that senior figures in the EU, as well as leading representatives from both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have already indicated support for the proposal. \n\"The European Parliament emphatically endorsed a resolution calling for democratic and social rights to be upheld in the north post-Brexit. The Parliament’s Coordinator on Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt supports continued representation for the north, as does the Fianna Fáil leader and Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly believes it is worth considering,\" she explained. \nSinn Féin recently made a submission to the Constitutional Commission set up to examine the boundaries of European Parliament constituencies which called for the creation of a new constituency in the north and Martina Anderson explained this legal opinion reinforces that submission. \n The Sinn Féin MEP made a direct appeal to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in the north. \n“An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stated that the people of the north will never again be left behind by an Irish government. This is the first real test of those words. There are a number of regions and territories across Europe that offer flexible and imaginative solutions to ensure citizens maintain their voting rights, it’s time Ireland did likewise. So now it\u0027s over to An Taoiseach. \n“2018 marks the 50th Anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement in the north. Brexit threatens many hard-won rights and protections that we in Sinn Féin will continue to fight to uphold.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

ni leisure show springs into action with fun fuelled launch","story":"\nLocal man Billy Nutt welcomed traders and exhibitors alike to the adrenaline-packed launch, which featured a spectacular parkour demonstration.\n\n                \nAnticipation is mounting ahead of this year’s second annual Calor NI Leisure Show, as dozens of exhibitors joined forces recently in an action-packed launch at Lisburn’s impressive Eikon Centre.\n\n   Load the IFrame Player API code asynchronously.   tag = document.createElement  tag.src = \"https:www.youtube/player_api\"   firstScriptTag =

and sponsors of the event alike, as he announced to a delighted crowd that due to the success of last year’s event the inaugural show which is running for the second year is set to open for one full additional day due to popular demand.\n\nLaunching over the weekend of November 2, 3 and 4, Nutt Promotions will once again highlight some of the finest caravans, motorhomes, boats, jet skis, tents, cycles, fishing and all things under the leisure banner that Northern Ireland has to offer, and this year it is set to be held across two jam-packed halls for the first time.\n\nFounder of Nutt Travel, Billy Nutt MBE, who has been involved in motorsport for over 40 years, explained: ‘‘On behalf of Nutt Promotions, we are delighted that, in 2018, the Eikon Exhibition Centre have now added a further larger hall, enabling us to continue with our planned expansion. We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

\n            \n\nLord Mayor, Cllr Julie Flaherty attended the launch adding: “The partnership with STA is a fantastic opportunity, and we are very excited to offer a fresh and innovative swim programme incorporating advanced swimming and Junior Leguard courses, as well as increasing grass roots level classes including baby, pre-school and beginner sessions,”\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe programme will have very little impact on children currently in lessons. The main area of change will be the names of the lessons from Stanley right through to Shark. \n\nA Progression Chart will be displayed throughout the sites. The change will embrace all areas ensuring a standardised programme is delivered to learners.\n\nLeanne Dougliss, STA’s Interim Sales and Marketing Director added: “We are happy to launch STA’s Swim programme with Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Swimming is a vital le skill that all children should be given the opportunity to learn. They have embraced this opportunity to enhance their swim scheme and we are delighted to be able to offer a current, cost-effective, quality programme that is appealing to learners of all ages and abilities. Together we can save lives through the teaching of swimming, first aid and lesaving. I look forward to working with the team to ensure their customers receive the highest quality lessons.”\n\nFor information on the getactiveabc Swim Academy, visit getactiveabc\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8070611.1500908083!/image/image.jpg","title":"so many women are being left traumatised by these implants","story":"\nA Banbridge woman who suffered 12 years of pain after having a vaginal mesh implant fitted is leading the fight for a moratorium on the use of the devices in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nDrawing on her own painful experience, Jackie Harvey has set up an online support group to offer help and advice to local women about mesh implants, and raise awareness about the complications associated with them.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nJackie Harvey.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe implants are used by surgeons in an operation to treat pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, which can be common after childbirth. But following reports of many women being left in agonising pain, there have been calls for the procedure to be banned, or at least suspended until the long-term safety of the implants can be evaluated.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAt the age of 36, a gynaecologist recommended that Jackie have a vaginal mesh implant fitted as a way of alleviating the urinary incontinence problem she’d been left with after having her second child.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nIn March 2005 she underwent surgery and it worked well. She recovered quickly, but unfortunately the plastic implant soon started to cause her problems.\n\n“After a year or two I noticed the tops of my legs were getting really painful and stf and I just thought I must be getting old, though I was only 38 at the time,” she explained.\n\n“I went to doctors ious times about the pain in my legs and got x-rays, but they didn’t really show anything. In 2009 I stopped doing any sort of impact exercise. I couldn’t run. I couldn’t really walk very far without getting pain in my legs, my feet and hips. I kept going back to the doctor and nothing was showing. In 2013 I was really struggling and I went to rheumatologist who told me that I didn’t have arthritis. I went to an orthopaedic consultant who told me he couldn’t see anything wrong with me. And then by 2015 I had seen an article online where a woman called Kath Sansom had started a campaign group called ‘Sling The Mesh’ and she was suffering from very similar complications to me, and it was just like a lightbulb going off in my head - this was 10 years after I’d had it put in.”\n\nJackie, who claims she wasn’t told about the risks so couldn’t make an informed decision about getting the implant, says the pain she suffered as a result of the device ruined 12 years of her le.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“It had a really detrimental impact on my le. I was struggling to walk and I was in pain and exhausted every single day of my le. I felt about 90. I was stf, sore and I just felt ill. For me to go to a doctor and my issues not to be recognised or accepted was just horrendous.” \n\nJackie was referred to a gynaecologist who told her the implant wasn’t causing her problems, but she refused to accept that was the case. She decided she had no other option but to challenge the doctor’s findings, and eventually had to pay for specialist treatment in England.\n\nThe 49-year-old office worker had a scan in London which showed that her implant was in the wrong place and was causing her pain. She finally underwent surgery at a hospital in Oxford in March this year to have her mesh removed.\n\n“As soon as I woke up the dference was amazing,” she said. “I’m still not perfect, but I’m an awful lot better than I was.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThrough the UK-wide ‘Sling The Mesh’ group, Jackie heard many stories of women from Northern Ireland who are suffering similar problems to those she experienced. So, in a bid to help them, she decided to set up her own local support group on Facebook, and it already has around 200 members.\n\n“This is a repeated story across the UK, not just in Northern Ireland,” she continued. “These ladies are going to their surgeons and they are being told ‘It’s not the mesh that’s causing your problems’, or ‘It’s all in your head’. It’s almost like they’re reading off a script.\n\n“These women are in pain, some of them are constantly getting infections, others are on antibiotics every day.\n\n“Their lives are a misery, they have no sex lives, their marriages have broken down, some have lost their jobs, they can’t enjoy their le, it’s just horrendous. That’s what spurred me on to push for some sort of recognition that there is an issue in Northern Ireland and something has to be done.”\n\nWhile the NHS says “the majority of women treated with mesh respond well to the treatment”, it acknowledges that “the Medicines \u0026amp Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  has received reports of complications associated with vaginal meshes - mostly regarding persistent pain, sexual problems, mesh exposure through vaginal tissues and occasionally injury to nearby organs, such as the bladder or bowel.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nJackie, who was the first woman to report her implant to the Northern Ireland Adverse Incident Centre at Stormont, is campaigning for the use of vaginal mesh implants to be suspended.\n\n“In Scotland there was a moratorium put on the use of mesh in 2014, by the Scottish government, and it doesn’t make sense that in the rest of the UK women aren’t afforded the same protection,” she said.\n\n“We want the use of mesh suspended whilst there is a review ongoing. We want the same protection that they have in Scotland. We also want a national register to register how many mesh complications there actually are.\n\n“So many women are being left traumatised by this. They are going to doctors for help and are just basically being fobbed off. It’s appalling. I hear the same story day in, day out from women looking for help and there’s nobody there to help them.

He just went from a child to an adult.\n\n“As he grew up as an adult, he turned to a spiral of drink and drugs. He thought it was helping him but in reality it wasn’t. He didn’t know when to stop.\n\n“His doctor wrote him a letter, basically saying could he be housed in some sort of sheltered accommodation. It never happened.\n\n“As parents, we were desperate. He was either sitting in his room or out on the drink and drugs.\n\n“He couldn’t get out of the loop he was in. He needed serious help and he just was not getting it. It was a constant cycle that was going downwards. He needed professional help to deal with the grief he suffered.”\n\nIn April, Billy and Sharon were told by Social Services that it was not safe for Sebastian to live in the family home with his younger brother  and three sisters, ,  and .\n\n“As  putting him on to the street was the solution for a vulnerable adult who has addiction and mental health problems,” added Billy. “Social Services’ attitude was basically Sebastian is out of the house and the kids are safe. Now their big brother is dead. They are going to need counselling. It is just a vicious circle.\n\n“We are terried of a knock-on effect. What  someone else in our family decides to take their own le? We were given no help to find him somewhere. We had to find him some sort of sheltered dwelling to live in.”\n\nOn August 13, Sebastian’s West Belfast flat and the Haggan family home were raided by police who claimed they had a warrant to search for ammunition and weapons. The family have complained about the searches to the Police Ombudsman. Sebastian took his own le just five days later and Billy believes the raid set him over the edge. \n\n“Sebastian was out on the streets again after the raid when his landlord put him out. I got him sorted with a place in Ballymena. Five days after the raid, he killed himself. I think it was a trigger – he just could not cope with any more stress.\n\n“He was found with heroin paraphernalia lying around him. We are still waiting on official confirmation but it seems pretty likely he took a heroin overdose to end his own le. Earlier this year, he told his sister the best way to commit suicide was a heroin overdose. He was right.”\nBilly and Sharon have criticised the system which they say is failing people suffering from mental health issues.\n“Sebastian needed professional help but it just was not there. We begged for help from a psychiatrist and for him to be sectioned but nobody would do it.\n\n“We think he attempted suicide on three occasions before. After the second attempt when his sister rescued him from jumping off a bridge, the hospital said he was ‘stable’ and that he ‘wasn’t that bad’. \n\nSebastian himself was willing himself to get help. What more did he need to do? He’d just tried to take his own le. The authorities need to listen to families who are suffering. The system has crashed, it simply does not exist. Hospitals just cannot deal with the issue. \n\nPoliticians need to start doing something. There is a deluge of mental health patients at the moment and basically no help out there for them. Nobody seems to want to tackle the problem. More mental health staff and teams are needed.\n\n “We tried everything we could. At the end of the day, Sebastian was the one who injected himself and killed himself but it all goes back to mental health issues. \n\n“We won’t be the last family to suffer. I wouldn’t like to think what the total number of suicides will rise to. There are more people killed by suicide than on the roads now.”\n\nIf you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues in this article, call Leline on 0808 808 8000 or PIPS on 02890 805850.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"undertaking a popular play","story":"\n\nFOR\n generations, Catholic undertakers in Belfast have buried Catholics and Protestant undertakers have buried Protestants.\nThree’s A Shroud, written by Stephen Large and directed by the hugely-talented Martin Lynch of GBL Productions, changes traditions once and for all.\nThe comedy play is back and is set to be better than ever before with more laughs, more characters and more chaotic scenes.\nThe storyline centres around veteran undertaker, Gerry McSorley who finds his Catholic customers being stolen by a young Protestant rival, Basil Gray.\nMcSorley’s funeral directors is run by veteran Gerry McSorley and played by the wonderful BJ Hogg, famous for his star role as Big Mervyn in Give My Head Peace.\nMcSorley finds his Catholic customers being stolen by a younger, more attractive and Protestant rival, Basil Gray .\nThings go from bad to worse when young Polish woman, Irena Bukowski’s  cut-price, new-age, interdenominational funeral home usurps them both.\nThis week, both BJ Hogg and Shaun popped into PJ Brown’s Funeral Directors on the Falls Road, as they get ready for their latest tour across the country.\nThe local business have kindly agreed once again to help the cast and production team out with some technical advice, funeral tips and providing coffins, of course.\nLooking ahead to this year’s show, BJ Hogg  said: “It’s great to be back with the show and it is set to be bigger and better than before.\n“Basically, it is two funeral firms, Gray’s  and McSorley’s . They bury theirs and we bury ours.\n“Gray decides he wants a bit more of the business and advertises to bury Catholics as well. Into the mix comes Irena Bukowski, a young Polish woman who undercuts the both of them for half the price.\n“My role as Gerry McSorley is similar to me in many ways –  a grumpy old man. He hates the internet and is in the last century and likes it that way.”\nShaun, who plays Basil Gray is looking forward to getting into his role once again.\n“The truth is Basil doesn’t want to be an undertaker, but his father has passed away so he takes over the family business for financial gain and to get with the widows.\n“Basil is a gangster movie fan and there is some fairly crazy scenes with dead bodies.\n“We knew the play worked and it was just a matter of adding a few bits and pieces here and there.\n“The audience was fantastic last year.

But in a dire situation when there are few good options, desperate measures can sometimes be necessary. A referendum may be the least bad option now.\"\n\nMr O\u0027Brien suggested that the most likely outcome of the Brexit negotiations at present was the UK crashing out without a deal.\n\nHe suggested the blame for this almost entirely lied with the British side.\n\nHowever, he admitted: \"The decision by the Irish and EU side last November to demand of the British that they concede the principle that part of their sovereign territory - Northern Ireland - be removed from their customs territory was a major miscalculation. \n\n\"Perhaps it is because Europeans have shared the same customs territory for more than half a century that the signicance of the proposal was under-estimated. But under-estimated it was.\n\n\"Countries do not cede their customs territory to others on demand.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"republican voters uneasy over direction of party says sf veteran mcglinchey","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

He said MLAs being paid for so long in the circumstances was not popular on the ground.\"\n\nThe source said Mr McGlinchey had stated that while he wanted to see Stormont back up and running, it shouldn\u0027t be at any price and he advised the leadership against cobbling together a deal that wouldn\u0027t deliver change.\n\nThey said: \"Sean McGlinchey said that he supported a  to power-sharing at Stormont but it shouldn\u0027t be at any price. \n\n\"He believed that Sinn Fein shouldn\u0027t go into government again with the DUP until there was equality across the board.\n\n\"He said a deadline should be set and  the talks didn\u0027t start by that date then Sinn Fein should pull out of Stormont completely.\n\n\"He also questioned whether there was a plan B  efforts to restore devolution failed.\"\n\nThe source stated that Mr McGlinchey warned that Sinn Fein would be punished in next year\u0027s council elections  they didn\u0027t set out \"clear direction\" on the way forward. Mr McGlinchey served 18 years in the H-Blocks. \n\nHe was convicted of the 1973 car bombing of Coleraine in which six people were killed.\n\nHe caused controversy three years ago when he told a council meeting in Coleraine that he was \"a proud ex-IRA man\". \n\nVictims denounced his remarks. \n\nHe defended his comments but expressed regret that he had made them in the town, which he admitted was \"insensitive\".\n\nMr McGlinchey had told councillors in 2015: \"I\u0027m proud of the men and women who were in the IRA with me.\n\n\"But that doesn\u0027t mean to say I am proud of everything the IRA did.\"\n\nThe Sinn Fein councillor is a brother of former INLA leader Dominic McGlinchey, who was shot dead in 1994. \n\nHe was elected mayor in 2011.\n\nHe has been a strong supporter of the peace process.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"french vessel en route to evacuate irish sailor from indian ocean","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

The hospital on Amsterdam Island is well equipped with X-ray and ultrasound equipment.”\n\nThe 2018 Golden Globe Race departed Les Sables d’Olonne, France, on July 1. Competitors are aiming to sail solo, non-stop around the world, via the five Great Capes and  to the French port.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"referendum to give irish presidential vote to people in northern ireland","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

If not, then don\u0027t. \n\n\"No one will be forced to take part, it is about giving a vote to those who want it.\"\n\nDUP MP Gregory Campbell was of a similar opinion that the vote wouldn\u0027t cause tension. \n\nHe said: \"I think most people will largely ignore it. It is of no consequence to us. Apart from a few diehard nationalists who I could see voting, it wouldn\u0027t make a dference. \n\n\"Even  the people here or citizens living in Singapore or wherever vote, the president will be the president of Ireland, it won\u0027t have an effect on them.\n\n\"I think people internationally will think it is a bit bizarre that there will be more people who don\u0027t live in the country helping to decide, rather than those who live there.\"\n\nThe amendment to the constitution was announced in yesterday\u0027s Sunday Business Post.\n\nSpeaking to the newspaper, Irish Minister for the Diaspora Ciaran Cannon said that other options were being considered, including the option to vote at embassies. \n\nHe said: \"That might seem practical, but  you are living in Ohio, it\u0027s a long drive to the Irish embassy in Washington.\"\n\nMr Cannon also stated that it was not possible to have the referendum for the upcoming presidential election on October 26, due to the complexities of organising the vote on a global scale. \n\nHe said: \"It would require a long lead-in time. There has been an interdepartmental group working on this for over two years. I think the symbolism of it would be quite special. \n\n\"The Taoiseach has repeatedly used the phrase \u0027Global Irish Nation\u0027. You do not have to reside on the island of Ireland to consider yourself truly Irish.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"morgan stanley to issue brexit update to clients this week","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Barclays is on track to bulk up its Dublin operations, while RBS expects that around 150 staff will help serve EU clients out of operation in Amsterdam.\n\nMorgan Stanley declined to comment.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"9 inventions that have arguably not been improved since","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nRHI Scandal\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nCourts\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Le\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLe\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Le\n\n\n\nSeptember 2018\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide 2018-2019\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

players, time to rethink your game because 300 new words are coming your way, including some long-awaited gems: OK and ew.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nMerriam-Webster released the sixth edition of The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary, four years after the last freshening up.\n\n“OK is something Scrabble players have been waiting for, for a long time,” said lexicographer Peter Sokolowski, editor at large at Merriam-Webster.\n\n\n\nEvery time there\u0027s a word with q and no u, it\u0027s a big deal\nPeter Sokolowski\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“Basically two and three-letter words are the leblood of the game.”\n\nThere is more good news in qapik – a unit of currency in Azerbaijan – adding to an arsenal of 20 playable words beginning with q that do not need a u.\n\n“Every time there’s a word with q and no u, it’s a big deal,” Sokolowski said. “Most of these are obscure.”\n\nThere are some sweet scorers now eligible for play, including bizjet, and some magical vowel dumps, such as arancini, those Italian balls of cooked rice.\n\nBizjet, meaning a small plane used for business, would be worth a whopping 120 points on an opening play, but only  it is made into a plural with an s.\n\nThat is due to the 50-point bonus for using all seven tiles and the double word bonus space usually played at the start.\n\nThe US dictionary company sought counsel from the North American Scrabble Players Association when updating the book, Mr Sokolowski said, “to make sure that they agree these words are desirable”.\n\nMr Sokolowski has a favorite among the new words but not, primarily, because of Scrabble scores.\n\n“It’s macaron,” he said, referring to the delicate French sandwich cookie featuring dferent flavors and fillings.\n\n“I just like what it means,” he said.\n\nMerriam-Webster put out the first official Scrabble dictionary in 1976.\n\nBefore that, the game’s rules called for any desk dictionary to be consulted.\n\nSince an official dictionary was created, it has been updated every four to eight years.\n\nThere are other new entries Mr Sokolowski likes, from a wordsmith’s view.\n\n“I think ew is interesting because it expresses something new about what we’re seeing in language, which is to say that we are now incorporating more of what you might call transcribed speech,” he said.\n\n“Sounds like ew or mm-hmm, or other things

all companies who claim to be able to help you with your debt problems have your best interests at heart.\n\nHowever, Begbies Traynor has already helped thousands of iniduals across the north find a way out of their debt problems.\n\nThere are a growing number of rogue debt advice firms who have made a business out of preying on people’s vulnerability during this stressful time. \n\nEntering an inidual voluntary arrangement  is likely to be something you do only once in your le, therefore it goes without saying that you may not be entirely sure how the process works and the fees you will have to pay. \n\nSome companies will take advantage of this ensure you are with a firm who not only explains the process, but also one who is transparent about their fees.\n\nBegbies Traynor, who operate across the whole of Northern Ireland has a fully qualied team of debt and insolvency experts will take the time to understand your situation and explain the ious debt solutions which may be appropriate for you. \n\nHere are few handy tips to ensure you do not fall victim to a rogue debt advice firms.\n\n\nOne size does not fit all \n\n\nWhile IVAs can be an ideal solution for some, they are by no means right for everyone. An IVA is a formal insolvency procedure and will have long lasting effects particularly when it comes to obtaining credit in the future. \n\nThere may be other ways of dealing with your debt problems which better suit your situation and your level of borrowing. \n\nIf you feel you are being pushed in the direction of an IVA without any alternative solutions being explored, you should be extremely wary. \n\nAny good debt adviser will take the time to understand your inidual situation and talk you through the ious options which may be open to you before recommending the most appropriate course of action. \n\n\nBe wary of false promises \n\nA common tactic employed by unscrupulous IVA companies is to tell you that they can wipe out a huge percentage of your current debts. \n\nWhile IVAs do often result in you paying back less than you borrowed, the actual amount you have to pay back is based on your inidual circumstances and the level of disposable income you have spare each month. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nThis can only be determined following a careful and considered examination of your finances and negotiations with your creditors. \n\nAlthough you may be tempted by these false promises, in reality it is much better to speak to an adviser who will tell you the truth about your situation. This approach will help you understand your options and choose the most appropriate solution for you. \n\n\nDo your research \n\nBefore signing on the dotted line, do your research into the IVA company. \n\nDo they have a physical office presence? \n\nHave you met, or been offered a face to face meeting with an adviser? \n\nAre they registered with the FCA? If you are having dficulty finding this information, have concerns that the company is not being fully honest about who they are, or  you have doubts over their credentials, don’t be afraid to walk away. \n\nAny reputable company will be happy to very who they are and provide details of the regulatory bodies they are part of including their FCA approval. \n\n\nWatch out for up-front fees \n\n\nFees are an unavoidable part of an IVA. \n\nEntering into an IVA will cost you money regardless of who you enter into the arrangement with. \n\nThis is because an insolvency practitioner  will be required to distribute your monthly payment between your creditors during the entire term of the IVA. \n\nHowever, the fees charged can y wildly from provider to provider and so can the manner in which the monthly charges are collected. These fees should already be factored into your agreed monthly payment amount you should not be charged an additional fee on top of this. \n\nIf your IVA provider asks you to pay them a separate amount to cover these costs it is likely you are being charged more for this service than you have to. \n\n\nIf you need proper debt advice, call Begbies Traynor on 028 90 918 200 or email at: \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"festive fun in store at llanfyllin christmas market","story":"\nLlanfyllin Christmas Market is set to  in November\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8702039/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nFestive fun in store at Llanfyllin Christmas Market\n\nThere will be plenty of festive fun at Llanfyllin Christmas Market\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8702040/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                \n                            \n\n                            \nSkip to next image \u0026raquo\n                        \n                    \n"},{"url":null,"title":"llanfair caereinion teddy surprise for rail visitors","story":"\nTeddy meets Station Master, John Brinkley.\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8719001/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nTeddy surprise for rail visitors\n\nThe Vintage Weekend trains require extensive shunting activity at each terminus.\u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gt \u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8718998/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nTeddy surprise for rail visitors\n\nTwo-year-old, Rowan Vivers meets Big Ted at Llanfair Train Station.

However that didn\u0026rsquot faze him as he lined up in front of the live ITV4 cameras.\n\nHe stormed past championship leader Zamparelli on the opening lap to grab fourth place, before posting the fastest lap of the race sas he began to close in on the podium battle and pile the pressure on George Gamble ahead.\n\nSome robust defending from Gamble saw Harper forced onto the grass on a couple of occasions, but he was able to find his way past heading into Copse corner on the penultimate lap to take third position, which he held through to the finish.\n\nA time penalty for the driver ahead though ensured the Dromore High School student ended the weekend with a second place finish as part of a superb one-two-three finish for the JTR team, with the result putting Harper just one point shy of fourth in the championship standings.\n\nHarper said afterwards: \u0026ldquoI feel I\u0026rsquom really in my groove in the series now and I\u0026rsquom going to be giving it everything to try and continue our great pace and end the year in style at Brands Hatch GP, a circuit I love.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch woman’s invite to join charity Twilight Walk  ","story":"\t\t\t\nBALLYNAHINCH woman Rosalind Steenson is urging people to join her on the forthcoming Marie Curie Twilight Walk to raise funds for the leading cancer charity.\n\nThe event \u0026mdash which takes place on Friday, September 28 at 7.30pm \u0026mdash will be held in the beautul grounds of Barnett Demesne in South Belfast to raise funds for an organisation which provides care to people with a terminal illness in their own homes or in one of its nine hospices.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe charity is also a leader in research into the best ways of caring for people with a terminal illness and all the\u0026nbsp\n\nservices it provides are free of charge, with around 70% of its income coming via donations with the balance of funds provided by the NHS.\n\nThose taking part in the forthcoming Twilight Walk can expect much more than just a walk as there will be a festival atmosphere with music, entertainment and a spectacular firework display to finish off.\n\nPeople take part in the walk for all sorts of reasons, with a large proportion walking in memory of someone they have lost.\u0026nbsp\n\nRosalind will be remembering her best friend of over 30 years, Michelle Watterson, who died in the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast in July.\n\n\u0026ldquoMichelle was diagnosed with cancer for the second time three years ago and, unfortunately, it spread to other parts of her body and became terminal, she explained.\n\n\u0026ldquoShe spent her final ten days at the hospice where she received exceptional care.

From the city of Porto onwards, you will see considerably more people but you\u0026rsquore walking along the coast which makes it really attractive.\n\nThe French Way, or Camino Franc\u0026eacutes, is the most popular route but the Camino del Norte along the north coast of Spain is a somewhat rougher trail of around 710kms. Edmund has done the French Way three time as well as the English Way.\n\nAs a social worker who manages hostels for homeless people in Belfast and beyond, Edmund sees his Camino walks as a way of taking time of his demanding work le.\n\n\u0026ldquoI get a chance to step out of the whole maelstrom of le and the pressure of work and everything else, said Edmund.\n\n\u0026ldquoEssentially it\u0026rsquos a pilgrimage but it\u0026rsquos also whatever you want to make of it.

There is a reception, lobby area and ground floor studio with Newry, Mourne and Down Council\u0026rsquos corporate colours a recurring theme throughout the building.\n\nThere are dedicated changing facilities on the ground floor with the pools designed for use by people of all abilities. The smaller of the two pools measures eight metres by 13, while the main 25-metre pool boats six lanes and electronic touch pads to time races.\n\nThroughout the building, every effort has been made to flood it with as much natural light as possible which helps provide the centre with its imposing look. A boccia court designed for use by disabled bowlers is also located on the ground floor, with this particular area also doubling up as a dance studio and multipurpose hall.\n\nCouncil officials have also revealed the new centre\u0026rsquos ground floor level is higher than the main road outside to protect the building from future flooding that may occur in this part of the town and which was a signicant problem a number of years ago.\n\nModern sound proofing techniques have been deployed throughout the building, particularly in the swimming pool and main hall areas. When the natural light fades,\u0026nbsp subtle, state-of-the-art LED lighting illuminates the building, adding to its unique character.\n\nMains gas was connected to the building which also boasts a combined heat and power source which helps minimise its carbon footprint with photovoltaic cells on the roof helping heat the water in the pools and shower systems across a number of changing room areas. In addition, air source heat pumps sucks in cold air from the outside and turns into warm air.\n\nSo-called ocalux glass allows natural light to stream into the building on the ground floor, also reducing glare and preventing people from outside looking in.\n\nThere are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room \u0026mdash the new leisure complex\u0026rsquos nerve centre \u0026mdash resembling something akin to the interior of a futuristic space ship.\n\nThe impressive four court hall on the first floor can be used for a iety of sports, including badminton, basketball and five-a-side football. One of the walls has also been specially marked at the request of the Down Handball Club.\u0026nbsp\n\nAs with the ground floor swimming pools, there is also a dedicated viewing area over the main hall, while nearby there is a dedicated area for racquet ball and handball.\n\nA spin studio and multi-purpose area are also located on the second floor, with all music and sound systems built in and controlled from the main reception area.\n\nThe third floor boasts spectacular views across to Down Cathedral, the Dromara Hills, the Mournes and across Dunleath Park towards the Vianstown area.\n\nWhen not admiring the views, users can immerse themselves in getting fit or pampering themselves in the vitality suite. The third floor boasts an 85-station fitness suite and fitness room that can be hired by sports clubs to use. Council officials say the use of the top floor will evolve over time and has the capacity to respond to need.\n\nEach of the eight beams which hold the top floor in place weigh 35 tonnes and had to be put in place overnight as part of a military-style operation which involved heavy lting gear and went without a hitch.\n\nThe vitality area extenuates the wow factor, featuring a relaxation pool alongside steam and sauna rooms, with the careful attention to detail in the design process accentuating this particular area where people can relax and unwind. There is also a dedicated lt to take people from the swimming pool area directly to the top floor.\n\nCouncil director Michael Lipsett said the new leisure centre was top of his in-tray when he joined the local authority eight years ago.\n\nSince then, he has attended countless meetings to propel the scheme forward and is delighted ratepayers will soon have an opportunity to use a centre which the district can be justiably be very proud of.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe long wait has been worth it and this is a fantastic building which I have no doubt people will appreciate and enjoy. It will also be a pleasure for our leisure staff to move to a modern building.\n\nMr Lipsett added: \u0026ldquoI have watched the building grow from the drawing board and to finally see it nearly complete is really something else. Everyone associated with the building, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially deserve credit.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTheir collective efforts have produced a magnicent building that would not be out of place in the private sector. That\u0026rsquos how good this building is.\n\nOnce staff move in and the old leisure complex has been decommissioned, it will be bulldozed to provide a major new car park at the rear. Ahead of the opening, council officials plan to organise a series of visits to provide the public with a glimpse of the spectacular new 21st century leisure centre.\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 19%2C 1978  ","story":"\t\t\t\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash Downpatrick\u0026rsquos old town hall is to be turned into a training centre for out of work teenagers in an exciting \u0026pound500,000 initiative to combat the district\u0026rsquos growing youth unemployment problem.\n\nWork has already begun on clearing the hall and the centre is to expected to be fully operational by January next year with room for up to 30 trainees.

The aim\u0026nbsp\n\nbehind the new centre is to give them work experience and provide them with basic skills in a iety of jobs.\n\nThe idea for the new community group is the brainchild of Mr Bill Hampton, of Down District Trades Union Council. Lending a hand is Downpatrick man Mr Malachi Curran, who is head of the Department of Manpower Services in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe whole idea has ben introduced to help young people who have been unemployed to prepare for work, Mr Curran said. \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot an apprenticeship, but rather is aimed at teaching them basic skills and perhaps helping them choose the type of career they want to follow.\n\nMr Curran said that they hoped to be able to put anything up to 250 young people through the course inside five years.\n\nCLOUGH \u0026mdash The death toll on a road outside Clough climbed to five in three years when a young motorcyclist was killed on Sunday.

They left Strangford in the morning on the MV Portaferry to explore wildle and points of interest on the lough.\n\nThe idea of the cruise originated with the staff of the Downpatrick Roads Division who realised that the ferry \u0026mdash often used for educational and pleasure cruises by many groups \u0026mdash was also ideally suited for use by handicapped people because of its ramps and high sides.\n\nThe crew for the outing worked their rest day without payment and the other overheads for running the boat were written off by the DoE as normal test running.

The top section, which is Norman, has been removed, though all of the archaeologist\u0026rsquos findings have been carefully preserved.\n\nOne of the most exciting discoveries was a large souterrain, or underground passage.

Twenty four year-old Hugh, formerly attached to Kirkistown Castle Golf Club, becomes only the second professional golfer appointed to the club in its 84-year history.\n\nHis appointment, combined with many other improvements both on and off the course, has made Ardglass one of the most progressive clubs in Co Down.\n\nBALLYNAHINCH \u0026mdash Ballynahinch piper Ian Jess took second place in the All-Ireland solo piping championships at Banbridge Technical College on Saturday.\n\nIan was placed second in the march section and third in the reel and strathspey section, but had to be content to finish runner-up behind Tom Anderson, from Dublin.\n\nIan is tutored by Joe McAdam, the pipe major at Ballynahinch, and is now regarded as one of the best pipers in the country.\n\nKILMORE \u0026mdash A former pupil of Down High School has obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Lancaster.

This was the product of gathering together his late father\u0026rsquos copious notes on the history of the town.\n\nThe society\u0026rsquos other founding members included Mr Robert Brown, an agent for Dunleath Estates who was treasurer, Down County Council official Mr Robert Maxwell, who was secretary, and the Rev John Radclfe, who was chairman.\n\nOther society members included other local clergy, headmasters, representatives of professions and local businesses and iniduals who were interested in local history.\n\nThe first meeting took place in Denvir\u0026rsquos Hotel where it continued to meet every month for several decades. At this meeting the objects of the Society were outlined \u0026ndash to encourage and foster interest in the history and traditions of Downpatrick and County Down, music, arts and sciences and the architecture of buildings and monuments of historic or artistic value in the area.\n\nThe following day\u0026rsquos Down Recorder reported that Mr Parkinson gave the first lecture of The Downe Society, fittingly on the subject, The Story of Downpatrick, in which he spoke about man reaching Ireland some seven thousand years ago, through to the ravages of the Norsemen, De Courcy and the Normans, the Fitzgeralds, Cromwells, Southwells and into the eighteen century.\u0026nbsp\n\nHis closing words were on the urban administration of the day with a sense of the historic past and the hope of future well-being.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 1948, the formation of the Society was a signicant attempt to bring together people from all sections of the community, particularly across the religious ide. Both The Downe Society, and its later partner, the Lecale Historical Society, maintained a proud non-sectarian record.\u0026nbsp\n\nOver the years, the society hosted many outstanding speakers including a Lord Chief Justice, local author Lynn C. Doyle, W.Y. Crichton, who was editor of the Down Recorder for 64 years, Brian Faulkner, the last Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, and mountaineer Dawson Stelfox, who climbed Mount Everest.\n\nOther speakers have included Senator David Norris with his one-man show on James Joyce, broadcaster Brian Black on his travels to Arctic regions and the late Arthur Pollock, verger of Down Cathedral, on his discovery of the Downpatrick Gold Find while digging a grave in 1954 and again in 1956.\n\nAnnual outing venues have included many interesting places such as the Armagh Planetarium, the Cathedrals of Armagh, Bishop Robinson\u0026rsquos library and stables, historic sites around Carlingford, walking tours of local towns and villages, The Somme Centre, The Boyne Valley Centre, boat trips and visits to private homes and castles. This year, the Society visited Collon House in County Louth.\n\nIn October 1960, a memorial to Sir Hans Sloane was unveiled in his Killyleagh birthplace.

The new body was named the Lecale \u0026amp Downe Historical Society, due to their shared aims, objectives and membership.\u0026nbsp\n\nIn 2002, the Lecale Historical Society launched its website with the help of Mr Pat Devlin and encouragement from the late Dr James Hawthorne CBE, the society\u0026rsquos then president.\u0026nbsp\n\nThis provided an outlet for the Society to give details on the work that it does with the website containing a full index of articles and authors for the annual journal, copies of reports, annual programme and newsletters.\n\nThe website also includes some historical resources for the Lecale area, which include the 1901 census, Lewis\u0026rsquo Topographical Dictionary, Grfith\u0026rsquos Valuations of 1863, ships and shipwrecks associated with Lecale, the Nannie Cinnamon letters and ious others. The Society launched its own dedicated Facebook page at its annual meeting five years ago.\n\nThe society, which is one of the largest of its kind in Ulster with a membership of over 250, wishes to thank its many members and friends who have supported its work and volunteered over the past seven decades to ensure that the history and heritage of Lecale and surrounding parts of County Down are recorded for future generations.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\nAnyone who would like to join the society for just \u0026pound10 and prevail of free entry to all society lectures and a complimentary copy of Lecale Review each year, should visit www.lecalehistory or email info@lecalehistory.

Even  you didn\u0026rsquot know the first thing about the place other than it was old, it was still clearly an important part of the history of Belfast.\u0026nbsp\n  After the fire, the past of the Bank Buildings became known and many lamented at the thought of losing such a piece of the past: for it to be turned to rubble and replaced with something nondescript. It\u0026rsquos easy to forget that while inanimate, buildings do have character and tell the story of a city in a way that brings it right into the present.\n  But with all that said, it seems now that the fire has been extinguished, some seem more concerned with preserving what is left of the building rather than putting the le back into Belfast. While it has been deemed structurally sound, some debris has still been falling when the wind has swooped through in the wrong direction and with the first storm of the season forecast for this week, the real integrity will only be known now.\n  For more than a fortnight, a firm cordon has been put in place around the burnt-out building and businesses in the immediate area have reported a severe drop in trade, with some stating their footfall has fallen by more than half. With the cordon expected to be in place until after Christmas, there are fourteen businesses within it who cannot open at all.\n  That\u0026rsquos not to say that nothing is being done to try and help those businesses.\u0026nbsp\n  Belfast City Council is working with other agencies to try and find alternative premises for these businesses and to ensure that they will not be left out of pocket for something that essentially amounted to sheer bad luck.\u0026nbsp\n  For businesses still open but noticing a fall in trade, signage has been placed to direct people around the cordon to ensure they can still move around the city centre. Translink too are doing their bit by offering a free shuttle bus that goes from St. Georges Market to the city centre every ten minutes.\n  Events such as fashion shows and promotional meals have been scheduled and there has also been the launch of the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast campaign which aims to encourage shoppers back into the city.\n  I\u0026rsquod say that you can\u0026rsquot fault them for trying, but I do see a few issues with all that is going on.\n  It\u0026rsquos not that I begrudge Belfast having their campaign. I really don\u0026rsquot. Their local economy is certainly going to have taken a hit following the fire and hats off to those trying to make the best of the bad situation, but I don\u0026rsquot think they\u0026rsquore going about it in the best way.\n  If people want to go to Primark, then put on subsidised shuttle buses for them. The company seem to have been brilliant in looking after their staff and sending them off to other stores despite losing thousands of profit a day with the loss of their flagship store and should be supported for that.\n  If you look at the list of businesses that are completely closed due to the fire, they include the likes of Tesco, a charity shop, McDonalds and of course, Primark. Only three or four of the shops would be generally considered higher end and are places where you plan to go to rather than just meander into as you\u0026rsquore passing.\u0026nbsp\n  If I was in Belfast and need to pick up groceries or want to see  there are any gems in the charity shops, a free bus to Victoria Square isn\u0026rsquot going to do me much good.\n  A fashion show showcasing the latest designer trends Belfast has to offer isn\u0026rsquot going to be of much interest to those who focus on affordability rather than ensuring that a print or certain cut is in vogue.\u0026nbsp\n  As the news of the Primark fire broke, many people spoke of how both they and their parents before them had depended on the store\u0026rsquos low prices when times were tough. To see a campaign promoting higher cost clothing must feel a little insensitive to those who now are worrying about where they\u0026rsquoll be buying their winter jumpers and endless pairs of gloves to replace those that keep getting lost in the schoolyard.\n  We wouldn\u0026rsquot have had the \u0026ldquoYour Belfast marketing campaign had it not been for the Primark fire so I can understand why it is focused on Belfast, but I feel that there\u0026rsquos huge scope to promote the whole of Northern Ireland as viable alternatives.\u0026nbsp\n  We all know that Belfast is still open for business so no amount of cajoling is going to make someone go there  they don\u0026rsquot want to but perhaps those in Belfast aren\u0026rsquot as aware of what other towns across the province have to offer.\n  The advert lists qualities that Belfast is said to have but it\u0026rsquos nothing unique. Here in Enniskillen, we\u0026rsquore also strong, proud and together. We too have great local music to offer and can offer a great night out. We also love our food, enjoy shopping trips and look out for one another.\n  We may not have had a fire, but our high street needs support too. Traders have been complaining about high rents and rates for years so there\u0026rsquos quite a high turnover rate of independent shops and small chain branches.\u0026nbsp\n  People go to where the cheapest prices are but small businesses can\u0026rsquot afford to lower their prices to match local competition so they risk losing out on trade. It\u0026rsquos a situation where no-one really wins. If the Belfast campaign is to be a more long-term one, then they should widen it to include everywhere. Promote the highlights of each county and make it accessible to all.\u0026nbsp\n  If Translink brought back open  tickets, I\u0026rsquom sure we\u0026rsquod see a marked increase in people coming here for a weekend break. Some people are understandably cautious of driving in unfamiliar places, especially towns but four hours on a bus in one day doesn\u0026rsquot leave much time for relaxing or shopping.\n                                    \n                \n                \n                \n                    \nThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\u0027s Editors\u0027 Code of Practice.

The milk botting plant began when his father began with a horse and cart. Now the business has a fleet of vans distributing milk and dairy produces to customers in four counties. However their products are supplied to customers across Ireland through the Henderson Food Service and other companies.\n  The borehole gives Draynes Farm a constant supply of water which is also useful to soften the mains water for washing.\n  A 50KVA solar panel plant has been installed on the roofs of some of the buildings.\n  Draynes Farm processes 5m litres of milk per year and operates Monday to Friday with their own supply of 1.2 million litres of farm milk held over the weekend until the beginning of a new week.

We are absolutely delighted with the set-up here, and last year for us was just unbelievable. This has given us the space to not only expand the products which were on offer last year but to incorporate new leisure pursuits such as fishing. I’m sure the fishing lake will be a great attraction in the new hall this year with the opportunity for the public to try their hand at casting. We also have more boats, more cycles and more outdoor gear on display with both Decathlon and Go Outdoors coming onboard. The thing we love about the Leisure Show is that local businesses come together and work as a team - I think it is just brilliant.’’\n\nBilly also delightedly announced that renowned chef Paula McIntyre will be at the show for three days with three demonstrations per day.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nShow sponsors including Downtown Radio and main sponsor, Calor NI\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nPaula enthused: ‘‘I’m delighted to be involved. Confined cooking facilities needn’t be a barrier to delicious food. \n\n‘‘I’ll be using the best of local ingredients to cook up dishes that can be prepared on a couple of rings or butane camper stove, I have first-hand experience of cooking in a campervan so it’ll be great to be able to show what can be done to the wider audience!’’\n\nWith a launch which included an eye-popping somersaulting spectacle from the Go-Fyt Warriors, who will be hosting a fun-fuelled challenge on the day suitable for all ages, this year’s show promises to provide all-round entertainment for the entire family. Representative Kevin Howlette said: ‘‘We’re delighted to have Go-Fyt Warrior here in a series of races and challenges for you all to become NI Warriors. Once you enter our ninja challenge your le will never be the same again.’’\n\nThe family-friendly event, which this year will also host a new dog show, will also boast refreshments, entertainment and camping packages - and is offering trips to local shopping centres for those wanting to make the most out of their weekend. Billy added: ‘‘Last year we were happy to welcome members of the Caravan Club and Motorhome Owners Club to stay with us in Balmoral Park for the weekend.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that this year this arrangement will continue and will be extended to members of the Republic of Ireland branches of these clubs. We plan to have over 500 units camping with us over that weekend with something for all to see and do. For three nights stay plus three days admission, including a shuttle service into Lisburn city centre and Sprucefield on Friday and Saturday morning with entertainment on Saturday evening altogether for £20 / euros and £15 / euros for OAPs.’’ A free shuttle transfer service will also operate from Lisburn Railway Station to the show site at Balmoral Park.\n\nCalor’s Andrew Sands, Cylinder Sales Rep, added they can’t wait to : ‘‘Calor has been operating now for over 80 years across Northern and Republic of Ireland. When we exhibited at last year’s show, we were blown away by its success and the interest we received for Calor products.’’ Calor NI Leisure Show will run on Friday, November 2 from 2pm - 10pm and Saturday and Sunday, November 3 and 4 from 10am until 5pm.\n\n\nTickets and online\n\nVisit: \nnileisure\n and Like the NI Leisure Show Facebook page at: \nfacebook/N.I.LeisureShow\n for updates.\n

Zealand and France. Whisked egg whites and very little flour make them wonderfully light, and the ground almonds make them really moist. Traditionally they\u0026#8217re small cakes, but here I tip the batter into a baking dish and cook it whole,\" explains chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\n                \n\"You can make the batter well in advance here,  you want to get ahead – it keeps well in the fridge up to a day ahead – but don’t macerate the fruit for this amount of time as it will become too juicy.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Serve with custard, vanilla ice cream or cream. The fruit can be played around with, depending on the season,\" he adds. \"Raspberries and peaches can be used in the early summer months, for example.\"\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHOW TO MAKE YOTAM OTTOLENGHI’S PLUM, BLACKBERRY AND BAY\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nFRIAND BAKE...\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Place the blackberries and plums in a bowl with the vanilla extract, sugar, bay leaves and half a teaspoon of cinnamon. Set aside for 30 minutes. Don’t be tempted to leave them sitting around for longer than this, as the fruit will become too juicy.\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 190°C fan.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n3. Mix the flour, icing sugar, ground almonds, the remaininghalf a teaspoon cinnamon and salt in a separate large bowl. Set aside.\n\n4. Lightly whisk the egg whites by hand for 30 seconds, so they just start to froth. Stir into the flour mixture, along with the melted butter, until combined.\n\n5. Tip the batter into a 20 x 30cm parchment-lined baking dish and top evenly with the fruit and juices. Bake for 40 minutes, covering the dish with foil for the final 10 minutes, until the batter is golden-brown and the fruit is bubbling. Set aside for 10 minutes before serving.\n\nOttolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi with Tara Wigley and Esme Howarth, photography by Jonathan Lovekin, is published by Ebury Press, priced £25.

Chequers plan is ditched, according to a new report backed by prominent Tory Brexiteers.\n\n                \nThe analysis, by the free market Institute of Economic Affairs think tank , urges ministers to seek a \"basic\" free trade agreement for goods and pursue \"regulatory freedom and trade independence\".\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nBritish Prime Minister, Theresa May, is attempting to negotiate a deal that will see the United Kingdom leave the E.U. in 2019.\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe report claims that Brexit creates an \"historic opportunity to form trade agreements with partners around the world\" and calls for discussions to secure new long-term free trade deals with countries such as the United States, China and India.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIn order to ensure there is no  of a \"hard border\" between Northern Ireland and the Republic, the report calls for \"cooperation mechanisms\" to enable trade \"formalities\" between the two jurisdictions to be completed away from the border.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe report also calls for food and animal health regime in Northern Ireland to be aligned with the EU, with suitable powers devolved to the Government of Northern Ireland to enable local politicians to fully cooperate and coordinate with the Irish authorities, in accordance with the Belfast Agreement.\n\nFormer Brexit secretary David Davis, who quit the Government over the Chequers plan, and Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group, are among the speakers listed for the report\u0027s launch in London.\n\nShanker Singham, who is the director of the IEA\u0027s international trade and competition unit and co-author of the report, said: \"Brexit has been too narrowly thought of as the role of the UK in the EU, whereas the reality is Brexit is a major global event.\n\n\"A G7 country is embracing independent trade and regulatory policy for the first time in 40 years - an unprecedented situation. This is where the Brexit prize lies.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Moving forward on the unilateral, bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral pillars at the same time will maximise the UK\u0027s gains, and also maximise it chances of a good agreement with the EU.\n\n\"We have looked at Brexit in the wrong way, and in so doing we have hampered our ability to get a good deal with the EU. We must execute an independent trade and regulatory policy in order to capture gains from this process, and also to ensure that we have a better framework for negotiations with the EU.\n\n\"This plan offers a comprehensive approach which shouldn\u0027t be considered a \u0027Plan B\u0027, but rather a \u0027Plan A+\u0027 for Brexit.\"\n\nThe report goes on to warn that UK customs must accommodate a potentially \"five-fold increase in customs documentation\" between the UK and EU on the day of Brexit.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt states that this could be addressed through \"general inter-agency and authority cooperation and information sharing\", \"use of simplied procedures and data\" and \"agreement that physical inspection of goods is only to be carried out by means of random checks\".\n\nThe report also sets out that an enhanced FTA, to be negotiated with the EU during the transition period, would include zero tarfs on goods including agriculture and \"regulatory coherence\" in areas such as pharmaceuticals.\n\nOn immigration, it calls for the free movement of workers to be replaced with an \"efficient and balanced framework\" for the movement of workers from the EU and the rest of the world which enables the \"dynamic recruitment of skills and talent where the market requires it\".\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n

country singer \"Big Tom\" McBride has praised a new statue of him as a \"fitting tribute\".\n\n                \nIrish President Michael D Higgins unveiled the monument to Big Tom in Castleblayney on Sunday.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe praised it as \"a wonderful testament to the popularity of Big Tom\".\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"That love for Big Tom, his music and the man he was is something that you know best but of course share, not only with people across our island of Ireland, not only in Irish communities across the world, but with many other peoples from dferent cultures,\" he said.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nBig Tom, who was a huge star in the 60s and 70s, died in April aged 81, as the statue and festival in his honour were in the process of being planned.\n\nThe entertainer\u0027s son, Thomas, described the unveiling of the bronze statue of his father as a celebratory moment, tinged with sadness.\n\nThe Co Monaghan town centre was packed on Sunday with over a thousand fans travelling from across Ireland and further afield.\n\nThere were cheers as Mr Higgins unveiled the statue, before a rush of fans eager to see it up close and get their photo taken with it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThomas told those assembled that his family were devastated his mother Rose, who also died earlier this year, as well as his father were not there to see it.\n\n\"The main focus of my few words is to give thanks, and we have many people to thank for making this day possible,\" he said.\n\n\"This day is a very proud day for the McBride family, celebratory yet tinted with sadness, for they have departed, Mum and Dad.\n\n\"We are devastated that Mum and Dad aren\u0027t here today, I know they would have loved it.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n\"Thank you all.\"\n\nBig Tom and the Mainliners were formed in the 1960s and achieved widespread success.\n\nHenry McMahon, another member of the Mainliners, also described it as a day tinged with sadness.\n\n\"It\u0027s a wonderful day, tinged with sadness, but it\u0027s no less than Big Tom deserves, he was an icon, and still is an icon,\" he told the Press Association.\n\nUK-based sculptor Mark Richards said he had never seen a crowd like it, in the unveiling of all the pieces he has worked on.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nHe explained initially he had considered a sculpture of Big Tom on stage performing, but later decided on the sitting pose without the microphone in front of him, like a \"barrier\" between him and his fans.\n\nThat option was chosen by the family who felt it best reflected Tom\u0027s approachability and \"man of the people\" persona.\n\nAmong the fans in attendance were Richard and Marian Phillips from Co Kildare.\n\n\"I have been following Big Tom since 1971, he had a lovely manner, very natural, very down to earth, everyone was his friend,\" said Mr Phillips, who was wearing a Big Tom T-shirt.\n\nMyles Kavanagh had travelled from Kilkenny and dressed as Elvis for the occasion.\n\n\"It\u0027s magnicent, Big Tom would be proud of us all, Big Tom was the king of country, I may be the king of rock\u0027n\u0027roll but he was the king of country, we\u0027ll always have Big Tom in our memories,\" he said.\n\n\"He was so kind, he brought so much happiness to people with his music and he was a gentleman on and off the stage.\"\n\nThe unveiling came during the inaugural Castleblayney Celebrates Big Tom Festival, which opened on Culture Night and continued across the weekend.\n\nMcBride\u0027s career spanned more than five decades, culminating in his induction into the Irish Country Music Awards Hall of Fame in June 2016.\n            \n    \n    try   catch     \n        \n\n            \n    \n        \n                                                          \n    \n                      \n\n    \n\n

Irish Regiment to take place in Northern Ireland.\n\n                \nSenior Army personnel described the event as a momentous occasion that will be remembered for a long time.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nHis Royal Highness The Duke of York meets the troops at the RIR presentation of colours parade at Titanic Slipways\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nMore than 6,500 people packed into the specially constructed parade ground for the presentation of colours, which involved hundreds of soldiers from the RIR’s 1st and 2nd Battalions.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nColours are presented to regiments every 25 years, and represent both their history and their future.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nPresenting the new colours, HRH The Duke of York, colonel in chief of the RIR, described the regiment’s history as “proud and honourable”.\n\nDuring a short address to the regiment and spectators, Prince Andrew said: “Today, I would like to wish every single member of this fantastic regiment every good fortune as they clear the way for so much that is important not only to Her Majesty but also to the United Kingdom.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe Band of the Royal Irish Regiment on parade in front of 6,500 spectators at Titanic Slipways\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“I wish you every continued success as you go about your duties and I now charge you to protect and follow the colours as they are intended.”\n\nHe concluded by saying the Royal Irish motto, Faugh a Ballagh, which means “clear the way”.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe new colours, which recognise the RIR’s service in Iraq in 2003 and the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross presented to it in 2006, were consecrated by Rev Dr David Coulter, chaplain general to HM Land Forces, before being presented and paraded through the ranks.\n\nThe Belfast man, undertaking his last official engagement before leaving the Army later this year, said: “I have the privilege of consecrating the colours. They then become sacred, so everywhere they are taken they are guarded, protected, looked after, and when they finish their time in service they are laid up in a sacred place to fade away.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nHundreds of soldiers from 1 Royal Irish and 2 Royal Irish took part in Saturday\u0027s presentation of colours parade\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“It is a great privilege to be able to say prayers in front of those colours and to consecrate them for all time.”\n\nThe commanding officer of 1 Royal Irish, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Lewis, said it was “a big honour” to have HRH The Duke of York present the new colours to the regiment on behalf of Her Majesty The Queen.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe audience included a number of former members of the regiment, including Ulster Unionist Party MLAs Doug Beattie MC and Andy Allen who praised the event.\n\nBrigadier  Joe O’Sullivan, honorary colonel of the Royal Irish Regiment described it as an “historic moment”.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nHRH The Duke of York standing behind Wolfhound Major Robert Moore and Irish Wolfhound Brian Boru X who proudly led the men of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment on parade.
