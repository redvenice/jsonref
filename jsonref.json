Photograph: Javier TorresAFP via Getty ImagesA second booster vaccine against Covid-19 has been approved for everyone aged 65 and over in Ireland.The administration of second boosters is likely to start within weeks, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said following a recommendation by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).Niac recommended that the second booster be given at least six months after the first, though this interval can be reduced to four months in certain circumstances.The Minister has also accepted Niac’s recommendation that a second booster, or fifth dose, be given to immunocompromised people aged 12 years and older.Immunocompromised children aged five to 11 years should complete an extended primary course, ie three vaccine doses, Niac advised.In recent months, Ireland has experienced a massive surge of Covid cases, driven by the spread of the OmicronBA.2 variants. Most fully vaccinated and boosted people are considered to be well protected, but waning protection from vaccines has left older and immunocompromised people at risk.“Those who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated continue to be disproportionately affected and account for approximately a third of hospitalisations for Covid-19,” Mr Donnelly said.“As such, I urge anyone for whom an additional dose of vaccine has been recommended, or anyone yet to receive their primary course or booster vaccine, do so as soon as possible.”Niac has highlighted the importance of children and adolescents aged 12-15 years and older completing their primary course of vaccines by receiving a booster dose, while those aged five to 11 years should complete a primary course of two doses.More than 700,000 people have received two primary vaccine shots but not a booster shot.Niac reiterated its previous recommendation that all pregnant women should be offered the vaccine.Mr Donnelly added: “I have asked the Niac to continue to actively examine the evidence regarding the likely benefit of a second booster to other groups, vaccine choice and interval in order to make further recommendations in this regard.”RolloutSpeaking about the rollout on Wednesday morning, Mr Donnelly told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland the Health Service Executive was already “pre-planning” and the second booster would be rolled out quickly.He said that assuming many people in the 65+ age group received their booster last November or December, they would be looking at having a second booster jab in May or June.He said evidence from Niac showed that an additional booster would provide significant extra protection against the virus.“We have about 700,000 people who have had the first two doses so they are very much on board with vaccine. They haven’t yet had their booster vaccine. Niac reiterated how important it is for them to get the booster,” the Minister said.“They also reiterated how important it is for pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy to get the vaccination as well.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cry for help from russian embassy in ireland as it faces fuel shortage","story":"The embassy has become the focal point for Irish anger over the war raged by the country’s president Vladimir Putin. Photograph: Alan BetsonThere has been a cry for help from the Russian Embassy in Ireland as it reportedly faces a fuel shortage.It is understood diplomats have complained that Irish oil companies are refusing to deliver supplies to their Dublin property due to the invasion of Ukraine. The embassy has become the focal point for Irish anger over the war raged by the country’s president Vladimir Putin. The Irish Daily Mirror reported that the embassy has written a letter to Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney’s department about the issue.They have urged the Government to intervene in what they have termed as a “clearly discriminatory case”.Asked about the matter on Tuesday, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said that, while he does not have sympathy for the Russian Embassy, there are rules in which Ireland must follow when hosting international diplomats.“There are particular rules under the Vienna Conventions as to how we’re supposed to treat diplomats and diplomatic commissions in our country so I think they have to be followed,” Mr Varadkar said.“I actually didn’t have the chance to read that article so I don’t know the details.”Asked about the reported letter, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it had no comment to make. The embassy has been the scene of demonstrations by those opposed to the invasion of Ukraine.Since the invasion began, protests have been staged across the city and the country as both Irish people and Ukrainians living in Ireland gathered to express outcry at the war.The Government has also face repeated calls to expel the Russian ambassador to Ireland, Yury Filatov. Last month, a man was charged with criminal damage and dangerous driving after his lorry rammed the embassy gates on Orwell Road in the south of the city.On Tuesday evening the embassy had not confirmed whether it had managed to secure fuel supply.

Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”.Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.”Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added.The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” .“Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords.She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle.“Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said.Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”.“Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"in addressing oireachtas zelenskiy joins long line of foreign leaders","story":"Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses Australian federal parliament via video link on March 31st, 2022 in Canberra, Australia.

Austen has been replaced on a university literature course to help “decolonisation of the curriculum”.The author of Pride and Prejudice has been replaced by Toni Morrison, an writer known for works about the African American experience, as the focus of an English module at Stirling University.Replacing Austen on the English literature programme would help the “decolonisation of the curriculum”, university documents stated ahead of the change.Swapping the Regency author for Morrison would also “contribute to increased ersity” on the syllabus, according to forms informing management of alterations to course material.This material will include markedly different themes compared to those in Austen’s novels, with students told: “The main topics covered will include racial difference and critical race theory, gender and sexuality.”Those taking on the Special Authors module in 2022 will also be taught about “black postmodernism, Gothic, as well as the aesthetics of the contemporary US and African-American novel”.The changes to the course come following a commitment made in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, with Stirling University Principle Prof Gerry McCormac saying the institution must “support an anti-racist agenda in higher education”.The 2020 protests prompted iconoclastic reviews of historical figures from Winston Churchill to Charles Dickens, and Austen was also dragged into the debate about slavery at the Jane Austen House Museum, which reexamined her place in “Regency-era colonialism”.The writer’s personal ties to the slave trade were also brought up, as her father Rev George Austen was at one time the trustee of an Antigua sugar plantation.The English and Literature department at Stirling has not critiqued Austen, and the university has said that its Special Authors module changes focus on an annual basis.Internal documents stated there would be changes to the structure of the course or the outcomes for students, other than improved ersity and “decolonisation”.While this is cited as a benefit in the application to change the module, the issue of decolonisation is also a cause of concern on the English course, with trigger warnings added to the reading list to alert students to “the language of colonialism”.The reading list for one English module states: “Some of the material in the module includes discussion of colonialism (including colonial violence towards men and women), enslavement, violence, racism, sexism and issues surrounding representations of gender, class, race, and mental health.”Historical colonialisms are not the only issue to receive a warning in the list of set texts, and another module warns that some writings deal with issues of “neocolonialism”, adding: “This is challenging material that deals with inequalities and ‘difference’ in erse settings.”Stirling University has said that its rotating Special Authors course “aims to introduce students to a erse range of writers, including international voices and those from British literary history”.Morrison, who died in 2019, was a Nobel prize-winning author known for novels including her debut The Bluest Eye, Song of Solomon, and Beloved.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Sajid Javid says ‘mass murder’ is being committed in Europe and compares civilian killings to SrebrenicaPolitics latest news: You must

manned a machine-gun post, perched in a freezing, waterlogged trench, overlooking Port Stanley.When the teenage conscript eventually returned to Argentina, after a brief stint as a prisoner of war, he had frostbitten toes, shrapnel in his knee and was so traumatised, he needed psychological support.Now, 40 years later, González remains convinced of two things – that attempting to take the Falklands by force was a terrible mistake, and that the islands were, are and always will be Argentine.“The Malvinas are one of the few things that unite all Argentines. Maybe the only other one is watching the national football team,” says the 58-year-old.“When I was sent there, it was completely unexpected. But I was filled with pride. I felt fear and a little bit of craziness, but there was no doubt that it was a just cause,” he added.Such views are held across Argentina, where street names reference Las Malvinas, the Castillian name for the remote archipelago, and where neighbourhood walls are adorned with murals depicting the islands in the sky blue and white of the Argentine flag. Along with the late Diego Maradona, the Falklands are also a favourite tattoo for many working-class Argentines.One poll last year found that 81 per cent of Argentines wanted Buenos Aires to continue its efforts to recover the Falklands from the United Kingdom. Equally, Argentines today overwhelmingly agree that the campaign should be pursued exclusively through peaceful, diplomatic channels.Carlos Ruckauf, a former vice president and foreign minister, compares the UK’s acquisition of the Falklands to Russia’s seizure of rebel enclaves in eastern Ukraine. “For Argentines, Luhansk and Donetsk remind us of the Malvinas,” he says.That belief is rooted in geography – with the islands located on a continental shelf 300 miles from Argentine Patagonia but 8,000 miles from the UK – and history. The Falklands were first discovered, uninhabited, by a British expedition in 1690. They subsequently passed through British, French, US and Spanish hands, with Madrid controlling the islands when Argentina declared its independence in 1816. The UK then occupied them in 1833, expelling a Hamburg-born trader who Buenos Aires had charged with exploiting the islands’ resources.The history resonates so much, says Carlos De Angelis, a sociologist at the University of Buenos Aires, because Argentina’s borders have remained relatively unchanged since independence. British sovereignty of the Falklands is perhaps the most significant perceived foreign intervention during the nation’s 200-year history.That context is something all Argentines are taught at school and is often repeated by politicians, especially the former president and current vice president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, of the Peronist party. In a typically symbolic move, Peronist politicians last month proposed renaming Rivadavia Avenue, one of Buenos Aires’ principal thoroughfares, “Argentine Malvinas Avenue”. They claimed the move was a tribute to the 649 Argentine servicemen who died during the Falklands conflict and even greater number of veterans who subsequently took their own lives.On the anniversary itself on Saturday, president Alberto Fernández led a ceremony with veterans and families of the fallen at the recently-opened Museum of the Malvinas in the Argentine capital. “The Malvinas are Argentine and also Latin American,” he said.The Falklands can also be used in Argentina to attack rivals. Last year, the opposition politician Patricia Bullrich, who had been a minister during the 2015-2019 centre-Right presidency of Mauricio Macri, which had downplayed the Falklands claim, made the mistake of joking about the islands, suggesting Buenos Aires use them to secure Pfizer Covid vaccines. She was forced to apologise after national uproar.“In school, they place a lot of emphasis on 1833. It’s a watershed. The islands are a feeling, an idea that unites all Argentines,” says Juan Bautista, 24, an international relations student at the Catholic University of Córdoba.He also draws parallels between Putin’s aggression against Ukraine and the decision by Galtieri’s military dictatorship to invade the Falklands in 1982: “In both cases, an authoritarian government sought to revindicate itself through a nationalist military adventure.”Yet Argentine curriculums do encourage independent thinking, says Gabriel Luna, 21, a film student at Buenos Aires’ National Arts University, who is more indifferent about the Falklands. “I just don’t like nationalism, or shouting your beliefs in other people’s faces,” says Luna. “Nationalism is harmful.”The Falklands war had profound consequences for Argentina – most obviously in hastening the fall of the junta.The dictatorship was already in serious difficulties when it launched the invasion, having presided over an economic collapse – including a 10-fold devaluation of its currency – and under increasing international pressure for its brutal, paranoid suppression of dissent, “disappearing” thousands of real and perceived political opponents. Just days before Argentine troops’ amphibious assault on the Falklands, an estimated 30,000 demonstrators gathered in Buenos Aires to protest – at the time, an unprecedented show of bravery against the dictatorship.The national mood was turned, briefly, on its head by the grab of the Falklands. Two days after Argentina had seized the islands, some 100,000 cheering, flag-waving citizens crowded into the Plaza de Mayo, the square that had previously become the venue of the lonely protests of the mothers of the disappeared.The euphoria was not to last. As swiftly as the British Armed Forces proved their superiority over their Argentine counterparts, the mood in the country turned to fury against a military government that had even proven incompetent at what was, supposedly, its speciality, namely fighting wars.“The invasion was like the grasping of a dying man,” says Dr De Angelis. “But it backfired completely. These generals and admirals were seen as not even able to organise a military campaign, as opposed to dealing with unarmed Argentine civilians.Veterans of the war were also treated as a national embarrassment. Mr González, who eventually forged an eclectic career working the lights in a theatre, as a security guard and teacher, recalls how prospective employers would see the stamp denoting that he was a veteran on his national identity card and then decline to hire him.“Employers didn’t want veterans. They thought we were trouble, difficult. They never said that to your face, but you knew,” he says. Four decades on, his life remains marked by that brutal month he spent on the Falklands, including occasional stabbing pains in his toes.“For me, it was a war between two governments, not against the British people. It’s clear the junta were criminals. They did unforgivable things – kidnap, torture, murder.“I think the British are a civilised people, with their mistakes, of course, like any other people. When I was captured, I was treated in a gentlemanly way. But I still believe in the Malvinas, and I don’t have any doubt that sooner or later, they will be Argentine.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Sajid Javid says ‘mass murder’ is being committed in Europe and compares civilian killings to SrebrenicaPolitics latest news: You must pay for the health services you use, says Sajid Javid as NI tax rise arrives New Covid symptoms: How to spot the early signs and what to do if you get themWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?Ukraine morning briefing: Five developments as Donbas residents told to get out now before Russians comeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rishi sunak donates 100000 old boarding school winchester college","story":"Rishi Sunak and his wife have donated more than £100,000 to  Winchester College, his old boarding school, it has emerged.The Chancellor was a head boy at the school, which charges £43,335 per year, before going on to study PPE at Oxford University.He and his wife, Akshata Murthy, are listed in the latest copy of the college magazine as “Wykeham benefactors”, meaning they have made donations in excess of £100,000.A spokesman for Mr Sunak said that the money would be used to fund scholarships for underprivileged children to attend the school.“Rishi and his wife have donated to numerous charities and philanthropic causes for many years and will continue to do so,” they said.“These donations are made to help fund scholarships for children who would not otherwise have the opportunity to go to Winchester.”Mr Sunak is believed to be one of the richest MPs in Parliament thanks to his past career as a banker and marriage to Ms Murthy, who is the co-founder of Indian tech giant Infosys.Some reports have suggested that he has a net worth of around £200 million.He has previously said that his time at the college “helped make me who I am as a person”.Despite insistence that the money donated to Winchester College would be used to pay for poorer students to attend, he was accused by Labour of paying money to his “old boys network”, rather than giving money to state schools.“Rishi Sunak has already said that he is ‘maxed out’ on how much support he can give to our state schools, but he continues to hand out billions in taxpayer subsidies to elitist private schools,” said Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary.“Labour would end the tax giveaway Rishi Sunak hands out to his old boys\u0027 network and use the money to improve every state school instead, ensuring everyone leaves education ready for work and ready for life.”Mr Sunak was asked about his millionaire background at the Conservative Party Spring Conference in Blackpool late last month, amid the cost of living crisis for many households in the UK.“I\u0027m sitting here in this job, as the product of a lot of sacrifice, and a lot of kindness from lots of people in my life,” he said.“They thought that would be for us the springboard for creating a better life for us.”He added that he understood that not everyone has the same opportunities in life, and that he had been “fortunate”, but would work “day and night” to spread those opportunities to families in the UK.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Sajid Javid says ‘mass murder’ is being committed in Europe and compares civilian killings to SrebrenicaPolitics latest news: You must pay for the health services you use, says Sajid Javid as NI tax rise arrives New Covid symptoms: How to spot the early signs and what to do if you get themWho is Marine Le Pen and what are her policies?Ukraine morning briefing: Five developments as Donbas residents told to get out now before Russians comeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"un impotent face horror","story":"It has never been so easy to gather evidence of war crimes. Satellite images now achieve such a level of detail that they can show inidual bodies on the streets. Smartphones have been used by the Ukrainians to capture photographs of atrocities and publish them online. Investigators will have no shortage of material to prove that Vladimir Putin’s forces are guilty of murder, rape, and the brutalisation of the Ukrainian population and that the Kremlin’s denials are mendacious.None of this is likely to make it any easier to hold Putin and his regime to account internationally, however, in part because Russia retains a veto as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, addressed the UN yesterday, saying this gave Russia the right to sow death. The massacres in towns such as Bucha have only highlighted how toothless the body has become.When the UN was set up in 1945, the hope was that it would avoid the deficiencies that plagued its predecessor, the League of Nations, which was powerless to stop the slide into the Second World War. To be fair to the UN, there has not been another major global conflict since it was founded – although that might have rather more to do with the proliferation of nuclear weapons than any high-minded discussions in New York.Aside from the embarrassing tendency for the most brutal regimes in the world to acquire seats on UN human rights bodies, at the heart of the problem is the Security Council. Populated by the victors of the Second World War, the UK and France retain a leading role, while larger economies such as Japan have no permanent seat. The presence of China and Russia, meanwhile, means that two nations that have long been guilty of terrible breaches of international norms can block moves to discipline them.There does not seem to be much appetite for reform, although countries such as India and Nigeria occasionally complain about the lack of influence accorded to rising powers. It is also not clear what sorts of reform would be beneficial, given the obvious risk that enlarging the central decision-making body would make it even harder for decisions to be made.Perhaps the rot at the heart of the UN mattered less in a world where the United States was still the global hegemon, or even when the US and USSR were locked in a cold war.

In the same period, wealthy parts of London including Battersea, Wimbledon, Cha and Fulham have seen the greatest increases in the number of people doing apprenticeships. Also the number of entry-level apprenticeshipshas fallen by more than halfin just over a decade, the think-tank revealed. Boris Johnson vowed to offer every young person in Britain a guaranteed apprenticeship, weeks into the first lockdown. The Prime Minister warned it was “inevitable” that there would be “many, many job losses” in the wake of the Covid pandemic. Senior Tory MP Tom Tugenhadt told the Mirror apprenticeships are “fundamental to levelling-up and fundamental to transforming the way we look at education in the United Kingdom”. He expressed concern that many young people’s “le chances will be affected in the lead up to the next election”more apprenticeships aren’t offered. Will Tanner, Director of Onward and former Deputy Head of Policy to Theresa May, said: “Apprenticeships are not delivering and without far-reaching reform will work against ministers’ ambitions to level up the country.Working class school leavers in poorer places need a decent alternative to university, not a system that increasingly serves existing workers in big businesses based in cities. Onward research previously found the PM and a number of senior Tory MPs risked losing their seats at the next electionthey failed to level up Britain. The Levelling Up white paper announced a £. billion investment in skills in  , a letime skills guarantee in England, bootcamps and a new UK-wide numeracy programme. But the words “apprentice” and “apprenticeship” don’t appear at all in the levelling-up white paper. Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, added: “For too long, the mantra has been “university, university, university” when it should be “skills, skills, skills”.

Speculation has been mounting that Boris Johnson could ditch the fracking ban as he draws up plans to wean the UK off reliance on Russian oil and gas.The long-trailed energy security strategy is expected to be published on Thursday after several delays. Fracking involves extracting gas from rocks and breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. A moratorium was imposed on the controversial process in November  after experts said it was not possible to accurately predict the probability or magnitude of earthquakes linked to the process. The Tory manesto in  promised: “We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.”Announcing the review, MrKwarteng said: “It remains the case that fracking in England would take years of exploration and development before commercial quantities of gas could be produced for the market, and would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term.“However, there will continue to be an ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cheap renewable energy and new nuclear power.In light of Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources.“However, unless the latest scientic evidence demonstrates that shale gas extraction is safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby, the pause in England will remain in place.” He asked for the report to be submitted before the end of June. Friends of the Earth energy campaigner, Danny Gross, said the idea that fracking could help to lower bills was pure fantasy.“We don’t need a review to know that fracking is not the answer to our energy needs, he said. The idea that shale gas extraction will signicantly lower energy bills or improve energy security is pure fantasy.“Fracking has been deeply unpopular with communities that have faced the prospect of shale gas extraction. They have stopped fracking once and,necessary, they’ll stop it again.“Energy efficiency and developing the UK’s vast renewable power potential are the best ways to deal with the energy crisis and bring down soaring fuel bills – and this must be the focus of the government’s upcoming energy review.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEnergyPoliticsNuclear power\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Yet the cash went to fewer than half of the  English areas that were eligible and told to apply.The funding is also much less than the ‘£bn bus revolution’ Boris Johnson promised a year ago. Once other commitments are added, it’s thought £.bn had been announced as of this week. Downing Street is understood to be in a tussle with the Treasury about getting the rest of the cash, with no guarantees it will be delivered. Read the full list of areas that got the cash - and that missed out. South Yorkshire’s Labour mayor Dan Jarvis said “we’ve been shafted” after his area asked for £m but got no BSIP cash - and his anger was matched by Tories.Conservative Don Mackenzie of North Yorkshire Council blasted: “We knew the Bus Back Better budget had been severely curtailed. “But I expected to get some money, not nothing at all, so Iaposm very disappointed.” The government claimed areas that failed to get the cash had not shown “sufficient ambition” with their improvement plans. But Shropshire Council said it had been praised for its “very strong bid” of nearly £m - only to get nothing. Its Conservative transport chief Cecilia Motley said she was “devastated”, adding: “We are at a complete loss as to why we have been completely overlooked.” Mr Mackenzie added: “I don’t think our plans lacked ambition, they were worth £ million over eight years.” BSIP improvements include making services more frequent and reliable, with cheaper fares and greener vehicles. In Cornwall, a trial starting on Sunday will see most fares cut.  Conservative Richard Smith of Suffolk County Council, which asked for £m, said: The funding we bid for would have given us a real opportunity to transform bus services in Suffolk. “It is disappointing but it should be remembered that this funding would have been over and above our existing budget of £.m.” Even areas that were successful got less than they asked for. Liverpool City Region asked for £million - and got £.million. Centre for Cities Chief Executive Andrew Carter welcomed the investment but warned: It is disappointing to see cuts to the National Bus Strategy funding, compared to what was promised last year. Several cities and city regions are getting a fraction of the money they applied for or, in some cases, nothing at all.Shadow Transport Secretary Louise Haigh added: “The Conservatives have slashed the funding promised, and dramatically downgraded the ambitions of many local communities.“Far from bus transformation, many will continue to see managed decline.“Communities nationwide will be paying the price for these broken promises.” Other areas that missed out include Hull, Slough, Telford and Wrekin, Lincolnshire and Cheshire. Officials insisted seven areas with no BSIP cash were handed money from other pots, including for zero-emission buses. They include North Yorkshire, Blackpool, Leicester, Tees Valley and South Yorkshire. The £.bn was separate to £m for zero-emission buses, £m for mayoral city regions as part of other settlements, and £m on a better deal for bus users. The Department for Transport claimed nearly two-thirds of Englandaposs population outside London will benefit from new investment”, including earlier pledges. It added another £billion had been given to support bus and light rail services through the pandemic.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: “Buses are the most popular way of getting around in this country – but for too long people outside of London have had a raw deal.“The investment we’re making today to ramp up the bus revolution will drive down fares at a time when people’s finances are tight and help connect communities across England.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TreasuryConservative PartyDepartment for TransportGrant ShappsAndrew CarterRichard SmithBoris JohnsonDan JarvisPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

But many believe the Conservatives are taking revenge on the Channel for its coverage of Brexit and willingness to hold Boris Johnson ’s government to account.So far over , people have signed a petition calling for the sale to be halted, and many of the channel’s stars have also spoken out against the “cultural vandalism”.So why is the Government selling Channel , and what will be the consequences for viewers  Why is the Government privatising Channel   Channel  was launched in  by the Thatcher government to encourage more independent television production. The not-for-profit broadcaster receives no public money and is funded by advertising. On becoming Culture Secretary, Dorries had to be corrected when she wrongly claimed the channel received public money. Announcing the sell-off she said government ownership is “holding Channel  back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon”. She added the proceeds from the sale – which could be as much as £billion – would go into “levelling-up the creative sector, putting money into independent production and creative skills in priority parts of the country”.  What do the Government’s critics say  Broadcasting experts say the sale makes no sense. They fear the channel will be bought by another media giant, possibly based overseas, which will want to make its own programmes rather than commission from independent programmes. There will also be less money for programming as money will be syphoned off to pay executives and shareholders. Who  has spoken out  TV stars have lined up to criticise the sale. The Thick of It and Veep creator Armando Iannucci accused the government of ignoring the results of a consultation, tweeting: “They asked for ‘a debate’ % of submissions in that debate said it was a bad idea. But still they go ahead. Why do they want to make the UK’s great TV industry worse  It makes no business, economic or even patriotic sense.” Matt Lucas, co-presenter of Channel ’s biggest show The Great British Bake Off, was one of thousands to sign the petition demanding the privatisation process stops. He said: “C is owned by the public, is self-funding and costs you nothing. All profits are funnelled straight back into programming. “Wrong decision by the government.” Kirstie Allsop said: “No true Conservative would sell Channel , Lady T will be spinning in her grave. “C was set up to foster the British film and TV industry and it has done that job admirably. Any Tory MP who votes for this is a traitor to their party and country.”  Is there another reason for the sell off  Tory MP Julian Knight, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee, suggested the sell-off was revenge for the channel’s coverage of Brexit. He said: “Is this being done for revenge for Channel ’s biased coverage of the likes of Brexit and personal attacks on the Prime Minister  The timing of the announcement at pm, coinciding with Channel  news, was very telling.”Some see it as a wider attack on public service broadcasting. Dorries has already warned the BBC licence fee could be scrapped by . Others fear the Government wants to silence Channel ’s critical news coverage and reporting, which it views as part of the “woke agenda”.The channel has not been afraid to hold the Government to account. During the  election, for example, it replaced Boris Johnson with a lump of melting ice when he refused to take part in a debate on the climate crisis. It prompted the Tories to threaten a review of the Channel’s licence – a threat they have now carried out.  What dference will it make to viewers  Under a new owner many of Channel ’s favourite programmes, such as Gogglebox and Bake Off, may not be recommissioned. There will also be a question mark over its cutting-edge drama output. Channel  commissioned It’s A Sin, which has garnered  Bafta nominations, after it was rejected by multiple TV stations. Private ownership could mean less money for programming as any profits would go to the owner and its shareholders. A lot depends on the terms of the sale. If the Government fails to enshrine in law the channel’s editorial independence it could mean Channel  News is replaced with a news programme that promotes a pro-government agenda. Will it definitely happen  Not necessarily. Dozens of Tories have spoken out against the plans. The Government could be hit with a backbench revolt when it brings forward legislation to authorise the sale.Among those to criticise the move are former Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who said: “I am not in favour of it because I think as it stands Channel  provides competition to the BBC on what’s called public service broadcasting, the kinds of programmes that are not commercially viable, and I think it would be a shame to lose that.”Tom Tugendhat, Tory chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told Times Radio: “Given the success Channel  has been in promoting independent production around the UK, I remain to be convinced this is going to achieve the aim the government has set out. I’ll be listening but I’m pretty doubtful.”Damian Green MP, Theresa May ’s former deputy, tweeted: “The sale of Channel  is politicians and civil servants thinking they know more about how to run a business than the people who run it. Very un-Conservative. Mrs Thatcher, who created it, never made that mistake.”Former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson branded the idea “the opposite of levelling up”.

They already had two children and my mum was pregnant with my sister, but she’d had a string of miscarriages and wasn’t sureshe would carry to full term.  “So, they adopted me and, after my mum gave birth to my younger sister, they brought the five of us kids back to Australia. “I told my mum that I wanted to find my birth family and she warned me to be careful, as my birth mother may not want to be found.” Armed with just a birth certicate, which revealed her birth mother’s name as Gayle, she discovered that her birth mum was a French Canadian woman living in England when she gave birth. And so the long search for answers began. Louisa said: “By then, I had children of my own, which made the search seem far more important. But I still only managed to confirm the few details I already had. “A friend of mine who had a big interest in family history was able to use my mother’s name to search shipping records and confirmed that she had travelled to the UK before my birth. I discovered this back in the late s, but I’ve since had those same records come up on Ancestry. “I was born in West Londonaposs Hammersmith Hospital and my adoptive father trained there for several years. This new record had my birth mother listed as a medical photographer, which led some people to assume she worked there and could have possibly met my father there, but that didn’t lead anywhere. “I spent years trying to trace my birth family with no luck and it was only when social media came about that I had any real place to start.” During this time, Louisa met and married her husband Jonny and the pair set up home in Antigua in the Caribbean, raising a family of their own.  She said: “I would still wonder a lot about my heritage and family history. It felt like a piece of who I am was missing. “Part of me always wonderedmy adoptive dad was my real father, especially when I thought he had worked with my birth mother. “Then both my adoptive parents passed away in , just  weeks apart. At a dead end in her search, Louisa tried to move on with her le, only renewing her efforts in  with her all-important Ancestry DNA test which, to her surprise, revealed links with Lithuania, where she was matched with distant relatives.She said: “I started talking to distant cousins in Lithuania that I never knew I had and, within two weeks, they pointed me to a Facebook page of a man in Michigan, USA, whose father had dated my birth mother in  and had no idea I existed.“His father was obviously very shocked to learn about me, but it was amazing to be able to make a small connection. It gave me a window into my family that I’d never had before and he was able to tell me more about the time he spent with my mother. I also found another DNA match who turned out to be my mother’s cousin, who had been raised with her in Canada. “My mother had passed away five years prior, but neither her cousin nor the children she’d had later had any idea about me.” Spurred on by the sudden influx of new relatives, Louisa decided to meet them face-to-face.She said: “My husband and I were supposed to go to a wedding in the UK in June , but instead decided on a road trip to visit my family in Toronto, Canada. “There I discovered my mother had confided in a few friends that she had met my father while on holiday in Europe. She discovered she was pregnant in the UK and what was meant to be a two-to-three-month holiday ended up being a year in the country as she was pregnant with me. Before heading back home from her trip in , Louisa made a pitstop in Michigan to finally meet her birth father, half-brother and half-sister. She said: “It was very emotional. As soon as I clapped eyes on him, I could see the resemblance to my son. Little facial features and characteristics that I never would have known were my father’s before this. “All the family I have met have been so welcoming and loving. “In recent months, my family in Canada have been looking through boxes of old photos my mother had kept and they actually found a couple of photos of my birth parents together. “One of them, at a dance, I believe may have been taken the night I was conceived. “They were both working at a summer camp together and had a fling. My father left the country when the season ended with no idea that my mother was pregnant. “Still not much is known about the following year that my mother spent in England, but she put me up for adoption before ing to Canada.” Now, Louisa is focussing on building relationships with her newfound siblings.  She said: “I’ve already had a girls’ weekend in New York, USA, with my sisters on my mother’s side and we are constantly in touch on a WhatsApp group.“My brother on my dad’s side of the family even came to visit us in Antigua on his honeymoon, so we definitely have an ongoing family connection. “When my birth mother died, they had her ashes put into pendants for necklaces. An extra one was made and no one ever knew why, but when I found my sisters, they gave the spare one to me so, even though I never got to meet my mother, I now carry part of her with me wherever I go. “It made me cry when they gave it to me. I was very emotional. I had always wanted to find my mother and was so sad to hear that she had passed away before I could see her. With this necklace, in a way, we are reunited. “For the first time in my le I feel a sense of closure. I now know who I am.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Road tripsHospitalsPregnancyTeenagersJewelleryAdoptionMiscarriageDNA\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Five of the poor pups were stuffed inside two cat carriers, while the other pair were confined to small wire crate, without any access to food or water.The helpless dogs were taken into Blue Cross, and after nearly a month of tender loving care, all seven pooches have found happy ever afters in wonderful homes.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Animal Welfare Assistant, Caroline Oram, said: When Moana and Tinkerbell first arrived in our care, it was clear that they had been through so much. They were so scared that they were trembling. We’d go to their kennel, and they’d huddle at the back and bark. “We had no idea what kind of le they had before to understand their needs.  Moana, a Yorkshire terrier and dachshund cross, was suffering with some hair loss, likely related to stress. She was particularly frightened and relied heavily on Tinkerbell for support. We wanted to get them into foster care as soon as possible, as they had been through so much, Caroline said. The pint-sized pair went to foster carer Christine Tilt, near Blue Cross Bromsgrove, and after just two weeks, they had already made a remarkable turnaround.  Speaking at Christine’s home on a visit, Caroline said: “The dference in them is amazing. Their coats are better, Moana’s fur is growing back and she’s more confident now in meeting people. They’re thriving now.” Tarzan and Jasmine were also placed into foster care in Southampton, and Ariel was fostered in Oxfordshire. Arthur and Belle, the most nervous of the group, stayed at the centre so that Blue Cross specialist behaviourists could help them overcome some of their fears.  And finally, Arthur and Belle were then rehomed in Oxfordshire.

Locals have stopped swimming in the Wye after it turned greenThe River Wye has been described as an open sewer Image: Adam Gerrard   Daily MirrorByNada FarhoudEnvironment editor:,  Apr |comments One of Britain’s most loved rivers has been described as an “open sewer” as vast amounts of manure pollute the once-pristine waters.The River Wye, straddling the border of England and Wales, is a special area of conservation but is suffering from its location at the centre of intensive poultry production, involving over  million birds at any time. We hear a lot about water companies’ overflows of human sewage, but animal muck is causing a bigger problem, especially in rivers in the west of the country.The Prime Minister recently told the Commons of a “memorable dip” he once took in the then-sparkling clean Wye, which he said was “like tasting nectar”.But now the river is turning into a poultry potty as manure from the birds is spread on the land as fertiliser at such high levels that when it rains it is washed off into tributaries.  Locals have stopped swimming in the Wye after it turned green, with the appearance of pea soup, from dense algal blooms caused by phosphates. Chicken manure contains higher levels of phosphates than other types. This bloom sucks up all the oxygen from rivers, suffocating fish and depriving species such as otters and kingfishers of their food. Swimming and kayaking teacher Angela Jones, , has swum in the Wye for  years but says it has become an “open sewer”. She says % of water crowfoot, which swans rely on, has gone. Poultry numbers in the area have doubled since , making it the free-range egg capital of Europe. Rachel Sharp, chief of Wildle Trusts Wales, warns the Wye is dying. She says: “The problem is too many chickens in one catchment, with statutory agencies not monitoring sufficiently and lack of any action. We are seeking to restore % of land and sea by , and restoring rivers will be a critical element of this.” Experts say there are only two years left to save the Wye. A group of  citizen science campaigners have gathered more than , samples from the river, which they have sent for testing in laboratories at Cardf University.  Manure is the Wye’s main source of pollution, according to a recent study by Lancaster University. A report by the House of Commons environmental audit committee last month noted evidence that  new intensive poultry developments had been granted permission in Powys in the past five years, and many more in Herefordshire. The Ithon, a tributary of the Wye in mid-Wales, contains phosphate levels up to  times higher than in a healthy upland river, according to an analysis commissioned by Fish Legal. The legal outfit, which represents angling groups, has begun a legal challenge after Powys County Council granted planning permission last month for a doubling in size of an industrial chicken unit near Builth Wells in the River Wye catchment, to , birds. Salmon numbers on the river have collapsed from peaks of over , in the s and s. In , only  were caught. Every river in England fails quality tests for pollution, the Environment Agency said last year, with just % reaching a “good ecological standard”.  The cause has the support of singer Feargal Sharkey, a keen fly fisher. The former Undertones lead singer said: “The biggest polluter in this country is agriculture and the industrialisation of food production, meat production, chickens, because all of that fertiliser.” The Environment Agency said: “We’re working closely with stakeholders to tackle the damaging sources of pollution in the River Wye from farming, water industry and home discharges, and run-off from roads and urban areas.” Aa Foods, which owns some local chicken units, said: “We’ve committed to play our part in tackling the issues but we are not a direct contributor: run-off from poultry farms in our supply chain is close to zero, and Aa Foods does not spread manure on land.”  Noble Foods, which makes Happy Eggs, said: “Although we represent a small, single-digit percentage of the poultry flock in the Wye  Usk area, we take our responsibility very seriously and have been working on thorough risk assessments, education, and action plans for the small number of producer owned farms we have in the region.” The National Farmers’ Union Cymru said evidence “does not support the hypothesis that poultry units are the main, or even a particularly important, reason for nutrient failures”. It added: “There are a range of factors that influence water quality in Wales. The Welsh agricultural industry is committed to making improvements in water quality where shown to be needed.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Feargal SharkeyAngela JonesEnvironment AgencyHouse of CommonsLancaster UniversityCardf UniversityPublic servicesPoliticsDaily MirrorEnvironment\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates from our environment editor on green issues and actions you can takeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Alex Mahon, Channel  ’s chief executive, wrote: “We have been informed in the last hour that the government will shortly announce that the secretary of state has decided to proceed with the proposal to privatise Channel .The move has been met with widespread concern, with well-known stars flocking to give their verdict on the events.The decision to sell the organisation, first formed in , is the largest example of privatisation since the Post Office was flogged  years ago. The Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, Nadine Dorries, said that government ownership was holding Channel  back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon.“A change of ownership will give Channel  the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future,” she insisted. The move was described by shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell as “cultural vandalism”. What does the sell-off mean for Channel    Labour has stressed that the privatisation of Channel  could cause a “great deal of damage”. Ms Powell expressed concern over where the ownership of the broadcaster could end up. She said: “I fear that … rather than competing with some of the big US streaming giants, it is more likely to be bought by one of them. That will take money out of the UK economy, out of the creative industries and the independent sector that has so thrived under Channel . Conservative MP Julian Knight tweeted that he believed the move would give Channel  more independence and space to compete. He said: “It is certainly true that Channel  will have greater freedom to compete once privatised andmanaged well it should be able to continue to innovate and crucially appeal to young audiences - a real usp in today’s broadcast landscape.” The public broadcaster is already funded by adverts, and so it is unlikely that this will change as it does not currently receive money from the government or the licence fee. There are widespread concerns the move will harm independent production companies with close links to the provider. It is thought as many as  could be at risk of closing. In the past, the organisation has never been tasked with making money, with profit being put back into the creation of its content. According to the , analysts have claimed that the sale could see a % to % cut to its £m programming budget in an effort to get the brand into a more commercially focused position. This means that shows and content that donapost make much money are likely to face the chop. What does Channel  and its stars say about the sell-off   Channel  itself doesn’t appear to be best pleased with the news. A spokesperson said: With over , submissions to the government’s public consultation, it is disappointing that today’s announcement has been made without formally recognising the signicant public interest concerns which have been raised. In his email, Mahon set out that the organisation had been pleased with its work over the past  years and had hoped to have seen this continue in the same way over the next . The broadcaster has laid out plans to the government about how it could continue to thrive under government ownership and was maintaining optimism that the sale wasnapost yet a done deal. In a tweet, Location, Location, Location star Kirstie Allsopp said: “This is a load of utter twaddle! No true Conservative would sell Channel , Lady T will be spinning in her grave. C was set up to foster the British film  TV industry and it has done that job admirably. Any Tory MP who votes for this is a traitor to their party  country.”Sir David Attenborough suggested the move formed part of “shortsighted political and financial attacks” while Invictus Games medalist and Strictly Come Dancing star JJ Chalmers said: Genuinely, a piece of my heart just broke. @Channel is remarkable… and important… and… the list is [too] long.The fact that those who hold [its] fate in their hands don’t see [its] true value… is the saddest part. When will the Channel  sale happen   The actual move to privatise may take a little while, provided it can get through parliament. The proposal is due to be added to a draft Media Bill, which will then be included in the Queen’s Speech in May. The bill will need to get through both the House of Commons and the House of Lords before Channel  can be sold. Overall, the process could take as long as  months. In his email, Mahon said: There will now be a long process ahead – it could take  months or more for the required legislation to go through the House of Commons and then Lords. During that time, we’ll continue to work with DCMS and government, and with our supporters across the industry to make the arguments to ensure that Channel  can continue to deliver its remit. What other implications could there be from Channel aposs privatisation   Ms Powell stressed that the sale would be likely to harm people outside of London the most. She said: “I think it will cause a great deal of damage to jobs and opportunities in the creative industries, especially in Leeds and Bristol, and Manchester, and outside of London.”It has been noted that the money the government makes out of the sale would likely be spent on creative and independent production companies, which would in effect be putting money directly into its funding pot for the levelling up agenda.Dorries described the move as a “creative idend for all” as she claims the money would be put back into the creative sector. Who could buy Channel   At the time of writing, it seems the organisation most likely to purchase Channel  would be US-based Discovery, which is joining forces with WarnerMedia, the parent company of CNN and HBO. Channel  faced privatisation in , receiving interest from Discovery at the time. The broadcaster has been valued at £ billion.

Sophia, then just three years old, underwent a successful operation to have the tumour removed and the family were feeling positive again when her scans ed clear in September . But just four weeks after the good news, doctors called Sophia back claiming that they had spotted something suspicious on her spine. The cancer had ed and the family were given the heartbreaking news that it was incurable and only a matter of time.Refusing to accept this the couple launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for a iety of treatments to attack the cancer head on. Matt added: We want to try and keep le as normal as possible for Sophia so we donapost let on too much about what is happening and we have to be brave ourselves. The doctors say that there is nothing they can do for Sophia this time but we refuse to accept that the cancer will win this battle. The pair claim they have already had success with holistic bio-resonance therapy which uses electromagnetic waves to manipulate cells and high doses of Vitamin C which Sophia receives intravenously every week. But the family need £, to sustain this and fly to Spain or Holland to undergo dendritic cell therapy which mimics the bodyaposs own immune system by releasing cells into the body trained to attack the cancer cells.

And as so often with the Tories, they talk tough on crime, only to go weak on the causes of it. Just look at the mess they have made of the Met. Sources close to the Justice Secretary say he was not aware of what his official had done until just before he was due to speak in the Commons. That does not wash. As Secretary of State, the buck stops with him. Honour brave Tom  Amani The Wanted singer Tom Parker was upbeat and courageous to the last. He bonded with law graduate Amani Liaquat as they both battled terminal brain tumours. Amani was frightened she was dying. Tom kept assuring her she was not. Tragically, they both died – Armani in February and Tom last week.  But during that last year of Amani’s le, it was Tom who brought her the joy of true friendship. And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure. The best legacy Amani and Tom could wish for is for the Government to agree to provide much more financial support.Darwin a loser We tracked down canoe fraudster John Darwin to the Philippines, where his we told us he will make nothing from a new TV drama about his extraordinary fraud.

Later in the period it will be unsettled across central and southern areas with spells of rain and showers throughout, some locally wintry particularly on higher ground.

Paramedics visited his home in Kingston-Upon-Thames, London, to treat burns to his hand he claimed had been caused by fireworks. Earlier that day neighbours said they heard three loud bangs, followed by shouting, a fire alarm and a cloud of smoke. Paramedics were particularly concerned by screws and nails lying near the site of the explosion and alerted police. Counter-terrorism officers arrested him three days later and began a search of his house that would take a week due to its unkempt nature. Officers found he had set up a laboratory in his kitchen and possessed all the ingredients as well as recipes for two explosive materials - Armstrongaposs mixture and black powder, reports MyLondon.  During the search of his home, they found a foil pouch containing a red substance which was combusted while officers inspected it. Prosecutor Tom Payne told Southwark Crown Court that officers found a page in his notebook that contained a recipe for explosives and a sketch of an improvised explosive device. Pym-Nixson initially told police he had been sorting through a box when an old firework went off in his hand. He said all the ingredients the police found had legitimate purposes such as gardening. However, he eventually pleaded guilty to possessing an explosive substance. On the day of the explosion, the defendant had been preparing three envelopes of Armstrongaposs mixture. He had detonated two deliberately before the third exploded in his hand, causing his injuries. The court was told that the -year-old was planning for the day when civilisation came under threat so that he could defend himself.  A police investigation and doctors report both concluded that he was not motivated by any extremist ideology but instead was obsessed with the breakdown of society. He had been legally acquiring the materials for explosives since , his Amazon and PayPal accounts showed. The court was also told that the defendant was a drug addict who was dependent on heroin and suffered from serious mental health problems. Around the time of the explosions, he admitted he was sort of out of his head on drugs. Pym-Nixson appeared before Judge Gregory Perrins today facing up to le in jail. However, Judge Perrins was convinced Pym-Nixson was not a danger to the public and sentenced him to  months in prison with a Serious Crime Prevention Order preventing him from purchasing any of the materials discovered for five years, starting when he is released from prison.

His only real problem is that he is consistent at making bad choices, and perhaps in time the worst of all will be when he decidednotto relinquish his motheraposs hand at the Westminster Abbey memorial for his father, to let her be led to her seat by someone  as he quietly slipped into his own.Instead Andrew kept her hand, eyeballed the Dean of Westminster into backing down, and flaunted the Head of the Church of England in front of a bank of TV cameras in the full knowledge that his fatheraposs memorial would be reduced to a news item re-upping allegations of sexual abuse.Worse than the public criticism, though, was the well-briefed fury of Charles and William, the next two monarchs who will not be as forgiving as the current one. And then the entirely-coincidental revelation that Andrew had not mended his ways, and had become embroiled with another scandal.This time itaposs a court case in which he, his ex-we and both his daughters are alleged to have been the beneficiaries of a grand swindle. A Turkish banker allegedly persuaded a Turkish millionairess to trust her cash to him, and she has told the court that he used the money to buy influence for himself with the Royals.The Turkish banker was applauded at the princeaposs now-defunct Pitch@Palace initiative, and around the same time Andrew received £.m, his ex-we £,, and his daughter Eugenie a further £,.The millionairess says she was told the money was for a passport. Coutts says they were told it was to pay for Beatriceaposs wedding. This is despite the fact a passport costs £., and Beatrice married a millionaire.  Andrew has now repaid the £,, but a further £, is unaccounted for. The Duchess of York has refused toher chunk, on the grounds it was paid for her work as a brand ambassador for a green energy company, even though it does not seem to be benefitting much from the connection. Beatriceaposs friends have described her as completely unaware of how her wedding was paid for, while Eugenie has let it be known she spent the £, on a surprise birthday party for her mother.And the question must now be asked of the entire family: what is it about dodgy money that attracts you Becausea £, bill for a wedding was settled by a Turkish political exile, any other bride would know about it. If any other woman got six-figure sums from her ex-husbandaposs chums she might wonder why. Andany one of us wanted to throw a surprise party and found it cost the same as a new car, weaposd throw a smaller onewe didnapost have the means to pay for it. Now the Royal Family finds itself in the unenviable situation of having paid £.million between them to make a scandal go away, just as the Duke of York manages to drive them smack into a new one - one which makes them look entitled, opportunistic, and desperate for cash to supplement a lestyle they cannot afford.At a time when the rest of the nation knows to the nearest penny what they can afford, and are turning off the heating or adjusting their shopping habits to scrape by, the fact that the future Royal Family canapost imagine a wedding that costs less than three quarters of a million pounds is not going to improve its long-term chances of survival.The timing of this court case, which has rumbled on for a couple of years, suddenly being made public in the week after Andrew embarrassed his relatives is interesting. And it may be linked to the fact that the Duke, who just a few months ago confirmed his public appearance at the memorial would be the last, is now reportedly considering smearing his pudgy chops across the Derby, a Falklands anniversary event, and the Platinum Jubilee. Why would a man who vowed to step away from the spotlight now be so intent on hogging it  Read more Prince Andrew is a true pauper prince - a man of poor wit, poor talent, and poor judgement. All that makes him rich is his title, and after giving up every other honoric his HRH is the one thing he has held onto. He is not allowed to use it, but he does still have it.He also held on to his daughtersapos titles, when other siblings relinquished them in favour of a more normal le. He fought for his daughtersapos Royal security, when it was costing £m a year and creating bad news as Met police officers were forced to trail after two girls on their gap yahs. For all the criticism levelled at Harry and Meghan for trying to trade off their Royal titles, Andrew and Sarah of York have done exactly that for decades, and with far more disastrous consequences. It perhaps explains why sheaposs still Sarah of York. Whoaposd want to change their name,it would cost you the chance to earn £, without having to go down the pit  Having lost his reputation, his ski chalet, millions of pounds and the trust of most of his wider family, Andrew seems to be intent on reinventing himself - not as a changed or chastened man, but as a prince, who needs to show no humility or shame. With the Queen by his side, Andrew can try it. But he has underestimated two things. The first is the fury of the British public, which does not forgive sexual misconduct in public le that easily, still less so when it involves someone legally a child. And the second is the ruthlessness of monarchy - the one quality which has been passed through that family since William the Conqueror. Charles may go easy on his younger brother, but William seems to feel nothing but scorn for playboy princes with dubious means of financial support. There will not be space on William Vaposs balcony for Uncle Andrew, nor much patience with the York familyaposs inability to adjust their lestyle to suit their income. Andrew is therefore working against the clock -being a prince is what turns a buck, then how much of a prince can he be, in the time his mother has left  The answer must be: for as long as her family lets the Queen be so exploited.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Sarah FergusonPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On Saturday, a -word post about how he ed from the conflict as a changed man was posted to his ex-we Sarah Fergusonaposs Instagram account. Andrew, who reached a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement in a civil sexual assault case a few weeks ago, flew missions as a Sea King helicopter pilot during the war, which was  years ago. His reflection appeared in three posts - which were removed after about two hours. Beneath the last post, it said it was written by HRH The Duke of York before the HRH was deleted.  The Queen stripped Andrew of his honorary military roles in January and he gave up his HRH style in a dramatic fallout from his civil sex case. And now, The Times reports that both Buckingham Palace and Andrewaposs team were both unaware his account had been published online and were blindsided by it.In the first Instagram post, Sarah wrote: I asked Andrew this morning for his reflections on the anniversary of his sailing from Portsmouth to the Falkland Islands  years ago. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Andrewaposs account begins: As I sit here at my desk on this cold crisp spring morning thinking back to April  Iaposve tried to think what was going through my mind as we sailed out of Portsmouth lining the flight deck of HMS INVINCIBLE. The -year-old concluded: So whilst I think back to a day when a young man went to war, full of bravado, I ed a changed man. I put away childish things and  bravado and ed a man full in the knowledge of human frailty and suffering.  My reflection makes me think even harder and pray even more fervently for those in conflict today, for those familyaposstorn apart by the horrors they have witnessed.Like many royal watchers, author Robert Jobson was left baffled by Andrewaposs Falklands statement and is unsure what he hoped to achieve. He told The Mirror: I am not one of those who slam Prince Andrew because it is the latest - and perhaps easiest - media target. But the Duke of York’s bizarre decision to try to bolster his own image by waffling on about his Falklands war experiences on his ex-we’s Instagram account and also use the HRH title that has been stripped from him to sign off was an odd move. He continued: His ramblings about the Falklands - where we accept he fought with courage - shows how out of touch he is. He seems clueless about what people really think of him these days - a far cry from those days as the handsome and feted naval officer and pilot. It is unclearthis was a shameless comeback pitch or a last hurrah - by reminding people that he was once a war hero. But ato public le for the -year-old is not on the palace agenda and it won’t happen. Eventhe Queen has forgiven her favourite son, and believes in him, powerful figures in the palace corridors haven’t. Nor have the public.

The Blue Cross says ‘cherry eye’ commonly protrudes from the corner of the eye nearest the nose.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. They said: “Cherry eye is a common condition inherited in certain breeds of dog, and in rare cases, it can arise in cats. “Although unsightly, cherry eye doesn’t normally cause any discomfort to dogs or cats unless it is left untreated and complications occur.” But Mighty Midge wonapost have to suffer with cherry eye for much longer as vets will be correcting his condition when he is old enough to be neutered.  Despite being a tiny puppy, Mighty Midge is said to have a big character and is courageous, adventurous and super friendly with people and other dogs. An RSPCA statement reads: He just wants to please. He is into everything wanting to be involved. He sleeps in his little bed on the floor by the side of my bed all night. He is used to travelling in the car and it sends him to sleep in his carrier. He doesnapost wee or poo now until early morning. He is used to going in the garden but uses puppy pad too. He is a delightful little man with lots of love and kisses to give. We know he is a little dferent but this amazing baby also deserves his forever sofa, just like his siblings have found. The food-loving dog can live with children and other dogs - but still needs to learn that itaposs OK to be alone sometimes. He will need to be taken to training classes to help him grow into a well-rounded adult dog.

Earlier this year, Andrew reached an out of court settlement with his accuser Virginia Giuffre in a civil sex claim filed in the US. It means that he avoided a potentially explosive trial with the settlement said to be £million. Andrew has continually denied the allegations against him. In January, he was stripped of his honorary military titles and patronages given to him by the Queen and it looked as though there was no way back for the Duke of York. But despite all this, the Mirroraposs royal editor Russell Myers has previously said that friends of Andrew say he still feels he has a lot to offer public le again. So do these signs below show he is trying to reinvent himself to play a more prominent role in the Royal Family Charity workJust months after Andrew put out a statement, approved by the Queen, that he would be quitting public le, he appeared on his ex-we Sarah Fergusonaposs Instagram account.A series of photos posted on her account in April  showed him putting together care packages for a local Windsor hospice.It led to criticism from royal biographer Tom Bower, who told MailOnline it was rather pathetic that heexploits the coronavirus crisis to creep back into the spotlight.However, fellow royal expert Richard Fitzwilliam did say at the time it was the sort of thing heought to be doing.Interview after Prince Philipaposs death Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. A year after this, the Queenaposs beloved husband and Andrewaposs father Prince Philip died at the age of  at Windsor Castle.In the aftermath of his death, Andrew was one of the first royals to publicly speak on camera about his fatheraposs passing.At a church service several days after Philipaposs death, Andrew said the monarch was feeling it more than everybody  but was remaining incredibly stoic, as he described his fatheraposs death as a terrible loss. It was his first public comment since his Newsnight interview - and just last week it was reported that members of the Royal household were left furious after Prince Andrew’s ‘completely inappropriate’ move right after Philip’s death. A source told the Mirror: “There is definitely a hand being played. “Hewas straight out the blocks in front of the cameras when the Duke of Edinburgh died, which was seen within the family as being completely inappropriate.Supporting victims In February, it was revealed that Andrew had reached a settlement in his civil sex claim.In a statement included in court documents, he expressed his regret at his association with Epstein and also vowed to support sex trafficking victims.It said: Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others. “He pledges to demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims.” And speaking on True Royalty TVaposs The Royal Beat, Mirror royal editor Russell Myers said this could have been Andrewaposs way of positioning himself for ato public le. He explained: “The language used in this [settlement] statement is that Prince Andrew will be helping sex trafficking victims. Is this him positioning himself to try and reinvent himself in the eyes of the public He added: “He is only , but it is impossible to see how he could have any future. His daughter Princess Eugenie founded and helped run a charity for victims of trafficking. Maybe he sees that as an avenue, because possibly his family are the only ones who think they can help him at this stage.” Philipaposs memorial One of the most high-profile events Andrew has attended in recent years is Prince Philipaposs memorial service, which took place last week at Westminster Abbey.It had been revealed in advance he would be attending the service in honour of his late father - and the order of service seemed to suggest he would arrive alongside his daughters Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.However, he ended up taking on a prominent role at the event by walking into the Abbey with his mother the Queen and escorting her to her seat.It was later reported that the Queen defiantly overruled heirs Prince Charles and Prince William to allow her disgraced son Andrew to have a special role at the ceremony.The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge “on more than one occasion” raised their concerns over the optics of allowing the shamed Duke of York to accompany his mother to the Westminster Abbey service last Tuesday. The future kings were “absolutely united” that it was “simply unnecessary” for Andrew to position himself as the only family member to escort the Queen to the church. But well placed sources have confirmed the -year-old monarch told them it was “her wish and final decision” that Andrew should chaperone her into the Abbey. Falklands War post  Meanwhile, this weekend, an account of Andrewaposs experience during the Falklands War was posted to his ex-we Fergieaposs Instagram account.Andrew flew missions as a Sea King helicopter pilot during the conflict and his reflection appeared in three posts - which were removed after about two hours. Beneath the last post, it said it was written by HRH The Duke of York before the HRH was deleted. The Queen stripped Andrew of his honorary military roles in January and he gave up his HRH style in a dramatic fallout from his civil sex case. At the time, a royal source said Andrew, who was born a HRH, will not use it in any official capacity. Like many royal watchers, author Robert Jobson was left baffled by Andrewaposs Falklands statement and is unsure what he hoped to achieve.  He tells The Mirror: I am not one of those who slam Prince Andrew because it is the latest - and perhaps easiest - media target. But the Duke of York’s bizarre decision to try to bolster his own image by waffling on about his Falklands war experiences on his ex-we’s Instagram account and also use the HRH title that has been stripped from him to sign off was an odd move. His ramblings about the Falklands - where we accept he fought with courage - shows how out of touch he is. He seems clueless about what people really think of him these days - a far cry from those days as the handsome and feted naval officer and pilot. It is unclearthis was a shameless comeback pitch or a last hurrah - by reminding people that he was once a war hero. But ato public le for the -year-old is not on the palace agenda and it won’t happen. Eventhe Queen has forgiven her favourite son, and believes in him, powerful figures in the palace corridors haven’t. Nor have the public. Derby Day appearance  Later this year a bumper four-day bank holiday weekend is planned for June with several events planned to celebrate the Queenaposs Platinum Jubilee.One of those events is the Derby, where it is hoped the Queen will attend.And according to royal sources, Andrew will accompany his mother to the event and act as her chaperone.A source told the Sun: “He was meant to stay invisible during the Platinum Jubilee so there is no way he will be at events like Trooping the Colour. “But the Queen needs a chaperone on all occasions at the moment due to her mobility issues and Andrew has earmarked the Derby as the one he will accompany her at. “He just doesn’t seem to understand the public outcry.”Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Prince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyQueen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Images of Coldstone, Aberdeenshire, showed a very wintry scene of fields with several inches of snow.The bad news is that the Met Office is stating that the cold air “will win out eventually” during the end of the week. On Wednesday morning it is set to be another cold start in the north of Scotland with sub zero temperatures and ice that could cause traffic disruption - while it could be as high as C on the south coast. The Met Office is predicting showers for most of the country during the day with temperatures in the south getting into the mid-teens but by Wednesday night the weather will start to get more wintry. Maps from WXCharts show temperatures getting as low as -C on Thursday and could dip to -C over the weekend with widespread frost across the UK. Snow is also set to continue in Scotland with around  centimetres likely to fall and it will stretch further south with a covering of snow possible in the north of England.  Met office forecaster Susan Powell said: Through Wednesday evening but particularly overnight into Thursday the colder air mixes in with our weather fronts and it looks like we could see some signicant snow for northern Scotland once again. A risk of ice here for first thing Thursday certainly and potentially that wintry weather affecting the central belt of Scotland through the morning rush hour. We will see the showers thinning out as they sink south through the course of the day but still the chance of wintry element across the Pennines into Thursday afternoon.  Sunshine for many come Thursday afternoon but it will feel chilly especially in contrast to the start of the week. Then cold air right across the UK for Friday I think there will be quite a bit of sunshine, wintry showers in the north and east. There is some uncertainty over a low pressure to the south of the UK which could bring very wet weather and wind to the south coast on Friday whileit pushes further north it could lead to more snow. UK forecast for the next  days Rain or showers for most Today: Outbreaks of rain across northern Scotland. Elsewhere, a mixture of sunny spells and blustery showers, some heavy with a risk of hail and thunder. Gales around some coasts. Tonight: Rain or showers across Scotland moving southwards, turning to snow on hills. Clear spells central parts, with rain for a time in southern England. Windy with coastal gales. Thursday: Sunny spells and wintry showers across many parts of the UK showers heavy at times and most frequent in north. Cloudier in far south at first with outbreaks of rain. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Wintry showers across central and northern areas on Friday, perhaps some rain into southernmost counties for a time.

Border collie Ellie has been learning how to socialise with people after being trapped inside a ramshackle barn.The three-year-old dog was rescued by RSPCA workers from the hellhole along with  other dogs, in January last year.The pack of pups were riddled with parasites and struggling for food in Ceredigion, mid Wales.to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories. Their owner agreed to work with the RSPCA when “the situation got out of control” meaning they couldn’t meet the dogs’ basic needs. It’s Ellie may have never even been outside, let alone interacted with humans before. But the poor pup has faced further heartbreak since, with her search for a forever home being unsuccessful. Ellie has spent more than  days searching for a new owner.  She is now one of RSPCA Cymru’s longest-staying dogs at their Bryn-y-Maen centre, along with five-year-old crossbreed Charlie, from the same rescue. Charlie was so terried when he was taken into the charity’s Newport centre that he spent the first six weeks of his stay cowering in the corner of his kennel. Bryn-y-Maen’s manager, Victoria Williams, said: “When Ellie arrived at the centre she was unsocialised and understandably nervous. “She’d been living rough in inappropriate conditions in a dilapidated outhouse with  other dogs and had never experienced a normal le, so we’ve worked really hard to build up her trust and confidence.  “For the first couple of months we’d sit outside her kennel and throw in high value treats for. “Once she was comfortable with that we fed her through the kennel bars before letting her out in the main block, leaving food bowls in dferent areas and gradually introducing more staff around her. “The next step was to get her used to a collar and a lead, and about three months after she arrived, she was finally ready to go for a walk. “It was really important not to rush Ellie and to let her do everything at her own pace. “We took in five other dogs from the same farm and whilst they have all been rehomed since, Ellie is still waiting. “She’s been with us a long time and has seen her friends from the barn all go off to new families, so we’d really love to see her settled and happy in her own home after everything she’s been through.” Ellie will need a quiet rural or semi rural environment with understanding owners who are going to be able to continue to build her confidence in an adult-only home as the only pet.

However, it seems you might want to do your research before opting for the latter as one woman has shared her horrendous experience.A TikTok user named Dakota Treacy has gone viral after sharing the botched eyelash extensions she recently paid for - claiming she went through hell and was left in pain. Posting under the name @deeeeeee, Dakota shared a look at what she had hoped her eyelashes would look like and how they actually turned out. Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here.Dakota was given huge fake eyelashes, which had been stuck to her lid with a ridiculous amount of glue. She described it as feeling like superglue had been applied to her eye. Itaposs so much worse than it even looked in the video, she explained. Now they look bad, but they donapost look too bad, butyou actually look in closer, under my eye, all of the remnants of glue - she obviously used so much glue. It feels literally on my eyes like she used superglue. Iaposve had eyelash extensions before, done very very very well and Iaposve never been in this amount of pain or have experienced this before ever. In a follow-up video, she continued: My le has been hell the last couple of days - Iaposve been in so much pain. Thousands of people took to the comments to share their horror over the extensions, with one lash technician warning that Dakota could lose her eyelashesshe tried to pull the glue off herself. Thankfully Dakota was able to find a professional who could fix the mess and give her the dream extensions sheaposd wanted all along. She added: My new lash tech who was so gentle and kind and patient - it took her  minutes with the solution and whatever to get those things off my eyes. She saved my eyelashes -Iaposd have kept them on any longer I probably wouldnapost have any eyelashes left. For some miraculous reason my eyelashes werenapost damaged, she put. anew set on and they are so nice and honestly, thataposs what I was going for - I didnapost want to look like f***ing Eugene Levy. Dakota finished the video by sharing that she had tried to complain to the original woman, but had been blocked. She went on to advise others to do their research before getting extensions.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Little did she know that she was actually about to give birthRachael says little James surprise arrival was the best thing thats ever happened to us Image: Rachael FogartyByJulia BanimAudience Writer:,  Apr |comments A woman from Liverpool was in for the surprise of her le after her dad took her to the hospital with what they presumed was a kidney infection, only to leave with her newborn baby son in her arms.Rachael Fogarty first began experiencing pain on November  while at work and had to go home early. She was unable to sleep that night and rang  the following day. The -year-old admin assistant was told there would be a five-hour wait for an ambulance and so, given that she only lives five minutes down the road from her local hospital, she decided to leave it and take herself inthings didnapost improve. After enduring another sleepless night, Rachaelaposs dad took her to AE at :am the following morning. The doctor went through all the usual questions but wasnapost able to figure out what was going on.That afternoon, Rachael was examined by a gynaecologist, who soon solved the mystery - she was about to give birth, having had no clue whatsoever that she was even pregnant.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Rachael recalled: I was sent to see a gynaecologist who, after examining me, asked, aposare you sure youaposre not pregnant apos, to which I replied, aposno I canapost beapos. She responded, aposwell, I can feel your baby and itaposs coming so are you sure apos, and so I replied, aposno Iaposm sure Iaposm notapos. An ultrasound was arranged, and all stunned Rachael could say was oh, as the gynaecologist pointed out her baby on the screen, telling her that he was on the way. She was then admitted to the delivery suite, her whole le having changed in the course of just one afternoon. Doctors believed Rachael was around  and a half weeks along, but she couldnapost work it out herself until her partner recalled a night out theyaposd had where theyaposd enjoyed a few drinks together.Rachael said: I just sighed. I have polycystic oian syndromeand so have gone  months without a period before, so to go nine months without one wasnapost abnormal.Iaposve been with my partner for  years and itaposs never happened before so I thought it would never happen. The saying is true, it only takes that one time.Naturally, the news came as somewhat of a shock, and Rachael remembers how her first thought was whether there was any way to stop him coming for a day or two, so I could have time to process the information and mentally prepare myself. She continued: I rang my mum first who thought I was ringing her for food, or for my dad to pick me up as Iaposd been there all day. She and my dad were over the moon and this was their first grandchild. My partner looked like heaposd been smacked with a wet fish, but by the time the baby came he was so happy and heaposs been amazing. When I rang my boss she didnapost believe me until I sent her photos and she sent an email to the company and friends got in touch to say it silenced the whole place for a good few minutes. Friends and family have been amazing. By the end of Saturday, we had everything he needed and it was so surreal.  Rachael gave birth to little James by C-section, at : am on Saturday, November , with the baby boy weighing in at lb oz. As Rachael had no clue she was even expecting, there were no records concerning the new mum and her baby boy until the following Thursday. Reflecting on Jamesapos dramatic arrival, Rachael describes her son as amazing and the best thing thataposs ever happened to us. The new mum arrived home the following Thursday but unfortunately had toto hospital the Monday after as her scar was not healing properly and had caused an infection.Rachael was kept in for another two weeks, during which time she had two surgeries and contracted both COVID- and MRSA. She says these negative experiences have sadly left her with a genuine fear of hospitals .However, despite having to contend with all of this as well as PTSD and post-natal depression, Rachael now feels things are only going in the right direction, and says her wound is healing well. Thankfully the parent is now able to get out and about once again, taking James to baby classes.She says spending quality time with her young son has been amazing, however, she has had to field some awkward questions about her surprise pregnancy.She added: For a little while, they were calling it a concealed pregnancy and kept askingsocial services needed to be involved. I ended up flipping my lid and shouting at one of the nurses, although I did apologise afterwards, that it wasnapost concealed, I was just that stupid.Do you have a pregnancy-related story to share  We pay for stories.

Butyouaposre not throwing some pre-made Aunt Bessieaposs in the oven and attempting to make them yourself, we have some top tips to share with you.Getting a good rise and golden colour can be a bit tricky, we know, but donapost fret, MasterChef finalist Bart Van Der Lee is here to help, reports Daily Star.His method is slightly unconventional, but we promise it works. To make the perfect batter, Bart explains that you need ml of sunflower oil, four eggs, ml of whole milk and g of flour.He told the: My favourite way of making Yorkshire puddings is those non-stick  cup muffin trays.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. “Start by whisking your eggs to get some nice air in your batter which will make them rise beautully in the oven later. “Add your whole milk, and then sieve in the flour.” Sieving the flour means that there are no lumps in the batter mix. When well whisked, pour the batter into a jug so it’s easier to add to the Yorkshire pudding tray. Bart added: Preheat the oven to °C and pour the oil into the cups. We want about a cm of oil in each cup so don’t be shy! Heat up the muffin tray with the oil for about  minutes in the oven. When the muffin tray is nice and hot gently pour in the batter. Use a spoon to catch the drip in between switching cups as we don’t want any batter on the sides.This will burn, get bitter and prevent the puddings from rising freely. Cook the mix for around - minutes and donapost open the door once during this time he warns. If you do, youaposll release the heat your puds might deflate. Bart recommends serving the Yorkshires with a roast dinner, or for a more spring-inspired dinner - try stuffing them with crab meat, sour cream, lemon zest and herbs. You can also freeze any pre-cooked puddings you have leftover too so thereaposs no waste.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

She hoped it would apostake some years offapos and she had the treatment done before parentaposs evening at her -year-old sonaposs school. But after the treatment Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, took a turn for the worse and her face swelled up - and when she went to the school her son couldnapost recognise her. What do you think of the treatment  Let us know in the comments...Mariana, from Northampton, East Midlands, said: I wanted to take a couple of years off, hoping Iaposd look like I was turning  instead of . Iaposve got really droopy eyelids on the top and they literally hang on my eyelashes and I can see it - so itaposs not just looking at it, it literally annoys me for my vision. Iaposve also got excess skin and dark circles under my eyes so I was hoping that would help tighten the skin a little bit because itaposs dficult to put make-up on because thereaposs so much skin.Right after I just had red skin and little dots but when I woke up the next morning it was really, really swollen. On the second day I woke up it was super swollen everywhere - top and bottom - and then as the day progressed and the next day the swelling stayed but then my eyes became quite droopy as well. I knew what I was expecting but it was still a shock waking up and realising aposIaposve got to go to parentsapos evening and face my childaposs teachers looking like thatapos.  The teachers asked meI had an allergic reaction and I said aposno Iaposm just trying to look youngerapos. The mum-of-four says she couldnapost help but laugh about her extremely swollen eyes and having to face the teachers on parentsapos evening just one day after the appointment. Most of her family also found it funny, but she says her -year-old son seemed to uncover an unknown phobia, with the sight of the burnt dots around her eyes made him feel aposuncomfortableapos.

This left the teen unable to be in the same room as his mum for a few days and still unable to look at her face on Motheraposs Day. Mariana said: My family thought it was really funny but my son must have a fear of holes or something because he literally couldnapost even look at me or be in the same room as me. It made him feel really uncomfortable and it was funny because it was Motheraposs Day on Sunday and he was worried about how he was going to spend it with me, looking like that. Luckily some of the spots had gone by then and he could at least be in the same room as me evenhe couldnapost look at me. The anti-ageing treatment works by targeting the collagen and protein-producing cells in the skin, stimulating them and causing the area to tighten up. The hot current creates small holes in the skin’s layer which have to be allowed to heal properly to avoid complications like scarring and pigmentation.

Honest media outlets have been shut down, and protests against the war cracked down upon with speed and severity. So the Russian people from Moscow in the west to Yakutsk in the east, from Archangel in the far north Arctic Circle to Irkutsk down south near the Mongolian border have no idea of what is really happening in Ukraine. Since the Russian invaded Ukraine on February , many Mirror readers have been asking what they can do to help. And while many have kindly donated to the Disasters Emergency Committee: Ukraine Appeal and offered to take desperate Ukrainian refugees into your own homes, it still does not feel like enough. Дорогой русский друг,Мы пишем тебе, потому что хотим, чтобы ты знал правду о войне на Украине.Великобритания — друг российского народа. Мы играем с вашими футбольными командами и пьем русскую водку. Мы знаем, что вы хорошие люди, которые хотят жить в мире и видеть, как ваши дети растут счастливыми, здоровыми и заботятся о других.Но мы также знаем, что в России нет свободной прессы, и вас ежедневно кормят ложью о войне в Украине.Поэтому вы можете не знать, что тысячи невинных людей, включая женщин и детей, подвергаются резне. Или что российские войска ушли из Киева, оставив свидетельства казней многих гражданских лиц. Некоторым стреляли в спину, когда они были связаны по рукам и ногам. Нам также очень жаль говорить вам, что женщины подвергались насилию, иногда на глазах у своих же детей.Мы знаем, что ваших сыновей, братьев и парней против их воли призывают воевать на Украине. К сожалению, жизни многих ваших молодых людей уже потеряны, и мы глубоко опечалены скорбью из-за этой ужасной войны.Пожалуйста, поверьте, что эта война, начатая Владимиром Путиным, незаконна, и её осудила уже  страна мира. Ваш президент врёт, когда говорит, что Украина представляет угрозу для России и полна нацистов.Если вы не можете или не хотите верить тому, что мы пишем, тогда, пожалуйста, хотя бы задайте себе вопросы, которые должны таиться в вашей душе. Почему ваш президент заставил замолчать свободную прессу  Почему ваших молодых людей посылают на смерть  Кому выгодна эта война Мы уверены, что вы, как и мы, не хотите, чтобы гибли люди, чтобы дети росли сиротами, чтобы семьи разрывались на части.Мы призываем вас быть на стороне дружбы между народами.Во имя мира,Читатели Daily Mirror So today we are printing a letter written in Russian which you can send to ordinary Russians to enlighten them of the truth and hopefully begin to combat President Vladimir Putin ’s lies.Our letter says: “We know you are good people who want to live in peace and watch your children grow up to be happy, healthy and care about others.But we also know there is no free press in Russia and your leaders are cheating you with a daily diet of lies about the war in Ukraine. Your President is not telling the truth.” The Russian people are not even aware of the heavy losses their own forces - their own sons, brothers, fathers and uncles - have suffered in this evil conflict. Cut out our letter in Russian, pop it in an envelope and address it. Russian addresses can be found on a random address generator at: www.bestrandoms random-address-in-ru  If you do not have the internet, maybe try your local library or ask a friend to help. Posting a letter to Russia costs from £. - and it may begin to change hearts and minds among ordinary Russians who have done no wrong but are simply led by a psychopathic dictator.Dear our Russian friendsWe are writing to you because we want you to know the truth about the war in Ukraine. Britain is a friend of the Russian people. We play against your football teams and drink Russian vodka. We know you are good people who want to live in peace and watch your children grow up to be happy, healthy and care about others. But we also know there is no free press in Russia and your leaders are cheating you with a daily diet of lies about the war in Ukraine. So you may not be aware thousands of innocent people, including women and children, are being slaughtered. Or that Russian forces have withdrawn from Kyiv, leaving evidence they executed many civilians, some shot in the back while tied hand and foot. We are also very sorry to tell you women were raped, sometimes in front of their children.  We know your sons, brothers and boyfriends are being conscripted against their will to fight in Ukraine. Sadly the lives of many of your young men have been lost already and we feel sorrow for all those mourning because of this terrible war. Please believe us when we tell you this is an illegal war by Vladimir Putin that has been condemned by  countries around the world. Your President is not telling the truth when he says Ukraine is a threat to Russia and full of Nazis. If you cannot or will not believe what we write please, at least, ask yourself the questions that must lurk in your soul. Why has your President silenced the free press  Why are your young men being sent to their deaths  Who benefits from this war  Like us, we are sure you do not want to see more people die, more children grow up orphaned, more families torn apart. We urge you to be on the side of friendship between nations.

Border guards were told to look out for any boy that may look like him in case he was with other refugees leaving the country. Many people from around the world did get in touch with Anna but sadly none of them turned out to be Sasha. Now she has shared the tragic news on Facebook that Sasha’s body had been found and she thanked everyone for their help in trying to find him.She wrote: Today we found Sashaaposs body. I thank everyone who believed, who helped in the search, I thank everyone for your prayers and faith, I thank you for your support. Thanks to you, my son met me. Sasha, our little angel is already in heaven! Today his soul found peace.. Sasha had been with his grandma when they tried to escape advancing Russian troops and fearing all exits via road were blocked, they tried to leave by crossing the River Dnieper. Their group had two boats and little Sasha was the only one known to be wearing a le jacket. One of the boats capsized and the bodies of Sashaaposs gran and another woman were later found dead.  Anna had hoped that Sasha could have been with others who had been on the boat and was hiding in a village maybe cut off from the rest of Ukraine due to the war. She said in an earlier appeal: “We believe in a miracle and wait for any useful information. “None of this would have happenedit wasn’t for the war. It was the Russian troops who caused it. There were eight people in the boat. “My mother-in-law was found, another woman who was with them was discovered the next day. They were both dead. Six people, including Sasha, are being searched for. “But in those places hostilities are underway. There is hope that my boy managed to get to a nearby village, but it is not yet possible to check that.“There are the villages of Tolokun and Sukholuchye nearby, but people there have no electricity and communications for about a week.” Sasha had been staying with his paternal grandmother when the region came under acute threat from advancing Russians. “My little son - our only child - was staying with his beloved grandmother Zoya, , when the war began,” she said. “They were in a small village with only two shops and two days after the start of the invasion all the food was gone. “The longer they stayed there, the worse it got with supplies and electricity. The three last days before they decided to escape by boats there was no electricity for three days.  “We were trying to get to them several times, or to get them out by road, but each time we had to turn cars back because of shelling.” She said: “Trying to escape from occupation, they ventured across Kyiv reservoir [on the Dnieper, also known as the Kyiv Sea] taking two dogs. “Connection with them was lost. Sasha’s granny was found dead on [March] , we could not collect her body, and asked locals to bury her.

The longer you stand the more dangerous it becomes,” she says.The last time we spoke three weeks ago Valentina had been evacuating Irpin. Living in the Red Cross office in Kyiv with her colleagues since the outbreak of war she sounded ferociously resilient. Her ability to steel herself to war, at least on the surface, was awe inspiring for a medical student barely beyond her teens. On Sunday night she speaks through heavy layers of fatigue, audibly eroded by what she has witnessed and the relentless days of caregiving and risk. She is more withdrawn, more distracted. She struggles to remember dates, timescales, details. She has ed home just once, for half an hour, three days ago, to “collect necessities.” She recalls in Bucha going to evacuate an elderly couple who had not left their apartment for around three weeks as fighting raged around them. To get to them they had to pass through a checkpoint. “We said we had come to take an old lady and an old man,” she describes. “They checked our car and then allowed us to go to the house.” They did not answer her knocks at the door for a very long time, to the point where she and the team became nervous.  She recalls: “The door opened in the end. The building was partly destroyed and there were a lot of unexploded missiles in the yard. “They wanted to catch their cat, get their things, but at last we could take them with us in the car. We told them to hurry, we are risking our lives. “When they realised they were in a safe car with safe people they calmed down. “They told us they were freezing, there was no heating or electricity. They had little food, they were scared they would starve.” In the centre of Bucha, Valentina collected wounded men from a hospital. “Their legs were shot through,” she says. The -year-old is careful as she chooses her words. She cannot feel emotion, she says, because it would not allow her to do her work. Fresh from two nights and days helping in a Kyiv hospital, she admits: “For now I don’t think it affected me, because I was ready for it. “There is a lot of emotion but I can’t express it, I have to stay neutral. I am trying to stay as calm as possible. I will try and deal with this afterwards when everything will end and I’m in a safer place.” For now, she says Kyiv is a little quieter. There are fewer air raid sirens. She admits she barely knows how le is looking on the streets as she has no time to absorb it. But she is wary “everything can change in one or two days or hours” and airstrikes are still a threat. For the next couple of days Valentina will rest as a curfew stops her and her teams ing to Bucha and surrounding areas. The military must make the heavily-mined areas safe. Then, the young woman willto support those civilians who are left in the debris, as best she can.

Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov leads the th Separate Motorised Rle BrigadeThe aftermath of the massacre in Bucha Image: via REUTERSByChris Hughes in the Carpathian Mountains, Ukraine:,  Apr |comments The Kremlin is sending troops suspected of the Bucha massacre straight back to the frontline to sacrice them, it was claimed today. But there are mounting fears they are also prepared to commit even more barbaric war crimes in other areas of Ukraine to the east of the country.Ukrainian spies believe the notorious th Motorised Rle Brigade will be sent into battle “hotspots” with little chance of survival, as the Kremlin scrambles to try and avoid them being alive for war crimes trials. Today Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence Agency said: ”Russian command will not rotate personnel in this unit and will throw them back to the frontline. “The Russian servicemen who committed atrocities in Bucha are being ed to Ukraine. “The th Motorised Rle Brigade of the th All Russian Army whose servicemen committed mass murder and tortured civilians will be ed to Ukraine.”Sources said they believe Russia wants the men to be killed so there will be no living witnesses to the Bucha killings. They are thought to include “Butcher of Bucha” Lt Colonel Azatbek Omurbekov - who leads the th Separate Motorised Rle Brigade. After his troops pulled out of Bucha more than  corpses were discovered of civilians, many of them with their hands tied and executed with a bullet to the head. Torture chambers have been found, where men were brutally beaten before being killed and the bodies of women and children have also been discovered. The remains have been removed from the town and are being examined by forensic experts preparing to present evidence in future war crimes trials. Today’s statement from intelligence chiefs added: “Another goal of the rapidof the th Brigade to the territory of Ukraine is the rapid disposal of unnecessary witnesses. “That is redeployment to a section of the front where they will have no chance of surviving to make it impossible to testy in future courts.” It goes on to claim the disgraced troops have opposed the move but they have been ignored and will get just two days’ leave before going back into battle.  Russia is under increasing pressure as its military has now suffered a death toll of almost , in almost six weeks of fighting. Moscow’s forces are continuing to suffer huge losses, retreating from major cities in central Ukraine, heading north from Kyiv and east towards Donbas. They have left dead bodies booby-trapped and trip-wires attached to grenades and mines in their wake, adding to the horror facing ing civilians. Luhansk governor Sergiy Gaiday said Russia is planning a major attack in the region as he ordered a mass evacuation. It is feared , Russian reservists are being called up to bolster a fresh offensive in the east in contested Donbas and possibly Kharkiv.  Today Ukraine also revealed the Kremlin is planning more horric “ flag” provocations - resorting to using the remains of Mariupol’s citizens. Kyiv’s SBU intelligence agency believes Kremlin spooks plan to pile more horror on the stricken port by claiming the dead were massacred by Ukraine. The agency - Ukraine’s equivalent of MI- said: “According to available date the occupiers are preparing a large-scale falsication. “They plan to gather in one place the bodies of Mariupol residents killed by the Russians themselves and present them as mass victims of Ukrainian troops. “False theories have been circulating that ‘Ukrainians are using civilians as human shields. This is an outright delusion.”  Sources have told the Daily Mirror that Ukraine’s intelligence agencies have had huge support from western intelligence, especially the UK and US. It has led to Moscow’s covert operations and  flag plans being leaked repeatedly as Ukraine has been able to second-guess the Kremlin. The Mirror understands that much of this intelligence has been hoovered up by British spy planes patrolling the region in the build-up to the invasion. Ukraine has also had constant updates from western allies on telephone conversations and other communications between Russian commanders. Today NATO warned of a fresh offensive by Russia in the east of Ukraine.  The alliance’s Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: “We are seeing a new face of the war.” He added that Putin’s troops are being “remanned” and “rearmed” ahead of a “new, very concentrated Russian offensive in Donbas.” The Donbas region has been heavily contested between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists backed by regular Moscow troops for over eight years. The war in east Ukraine was triggered by the pro-European Maidan protests in  which led to Putin ordering the annexing of Crimea and the arming of separatists. Moscow’s GRU spooks also spread lies via puppet media throughout the region and Russia about Kyiv’s government being supported by “fascists.” Putin’s argument for the invasion of “denazication” has been justied by the  narrative already spread about nazis being re in Ukraine.

During the UK-convened meeting of the UNaposs most powerful body, whose membership includes Russia, Mr Zelensky called for those responsible to be brought to justice in a tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials.Zelensky warned the world is yet to see the acts committed by the Kremlinaposs troops in other regions after evidence of atrocities was unearthed after their withdrawal from Bucha, near Kyiv.Today, as a result of Russiaaposs actions in our country, in Ukraine, the most terrible war crimes weaposve seen since the end of World War Two are being committed, he said in the virtual address. Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and air strikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from the hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from air strikes. The massacre in our city of Bucha is unfortunately only one of many examples of what the occupiers have been doing on our land for the past  days.  Mr Zelensky, in his first address to the council, accused Russia of wanting to turn Ukraine into silent slaves and its military of wide-scale looting, stealing everything from food to bloodied jewellery. The Russian military and those who gave them orders must be brought to justice immediately for war crimes in Ukraine, he said. Anyone who has given criminal orders and carried out them by killing our people will be brought before the tribunal, which should be similar to the Nuremberg tribunals.  Mr Zelensky played allies a video appearing to show bound, killed and burned civilians and mass graves in images from across his nation that the UKaposs ambassador to the UN Dame Barbara Woodward described as harrowing. Meanwhile, on the second day of her trip to Warsaw, Ms Truss reiterated her vow to use Thursdayaposs meeting of G and Nato allies to press for further sanctions. Having met Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and her Polish counterpart, she said economic actions so far are having a crippling impact and pushing the Russian economy back into the Soviet era.  She said the West has frozen more than  billion US dollarsof Putinaposs war chest, rendering unavailable over % of the regimeaposs  billion US dollarsof foreign currency reserves. But she said they must go further, to include further cracking down on Russian banks and going after industries that are filling Putinaposs war chest, like gold, and agreeing a clear timetable to eliminate our imports of Russian oil, coal and gas. Mr Morawiecki has criticised German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for focusing on the voices of German businesses rather than the innocents killed in Ukraine.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is likely to urge Germany to set a date for phasing out Russian gas when he meets Mr Scholz in Downing Street on Friday.The UK, which currently holds the Security Councilaposs presidency, convened the meeting to discuss seeking justice over the mounting evidence of war crimes.  Mr Zelensky made his address a day after visiting Bucha to witness the fallout and warning of further atrocities as the Russian president repositions his troops from around the capital to the south east. Russiaaposs envoy to the UN Vasily Alekseevich Nebenzya also addressed the meeting, disputing the evidence of atrocities in Bucha, criticising Mr Zelensky and repeating baseless allegations of Nazism among Kyivaposs leadership. However, the Kremlinaposs claims that the footage of bodies in the town has been staged has been contradicted by satellite images showing corpses in the street nearly two weeks before Russians fled the town. The Nuremberg trials were held to bring Nazi war criminals to justice following the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany in . The court cases, held in  and , tried the criminal actions of German professionals, industrialists, the SS, and the military officers tied to Adolf Hitler.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

It’s a hormone which helps build trust and attachment, as opposed to cortisol, which increases stress levels.We do sometimes need cortisol when faced with a challenge or fearful situation, so it does have its . It’s part of our fight and flight response. But the problem arises when levels remain too high for an extended period of time, as this keeps our bodies under a constant state of stress.When this happens, it can cause anxiety and depression, but also lots of physical issues such as headaches and tummy pain. It’s very dficult to concentrate and remember things when we are in this state.The study showed that for children in hospital, a time full of stress and worry for many reasons, storytelling resulted in an increase in oxytocin levels and reduction of cortisol, and so made the children feel less anxious and stressed, and even helped ease their physical pain.While the context of this research was children in the very stressful situation of being in hospital, I think the results and conclusions are also relevant for children in other stressful settings, including at school and home. I’m not making a direct comparison, but we’ve not had ‘normal times’ recently, and even in usual times, high levels of stress can be a big issue for many. So levels of stress and anxiety are heightened, even beyond the ‘normal’ for many of us.Some of the language in the article is related to the science of the findings, but the conclusions and observations are things teachers, parents and storytellers of all kinds will recognise. It describes how children being told the story “are transported to another possible world during storytelling sessions” and can “elicit positive physiological and psychological changes”. In other words, it can have a positive effect on physical and mental health.This transportation to “another possible world” is what storytellers often refer to as the story trance. It’s when children are absorbed in a story, and taken by their imagination to the world the story creates. The report explains that this absorption stimulates ious parts of the brain and aids the listener’s development of empathy, as well as a better understanding of their own emotions.None of this is really surprising, of course. But it’s really useful to have this kind of scientic back-up. An important finding was that the stories told were ones widely available and not specically adapted for therapeutic use just the kind of tales you find in a book from the library.And while they used professional storytellers for the research, a key point was that everyone can have this impact, including parents and caregivers: “It is important to note that even though we have used experienced storytellers for our research purposes, we believe that parents should be encouraged to tell their children stories. As we have shown, it is not necessary to use special stories or books or even specic techniques to achieve a successful outcome. Storytelling can be an effective means of creating important emotional bonds.”As I have said, this study looked at the impact of storytelling for children in hospital, which can be a deeply distressing time for both child and parents.Reading the report made me remember the time I was seven years old in the Western General Hospital, in an isolation ward by myself, very ill. I was told a story about a dragon who lived in a castle, and was given a model castle, made from used toilet rolls, and painted silver. I’d look at it when I was alone, which I always was except for visits. It was a stage for my imagination. I’d speak to the dragon and imagine the adventures I’d have with him when I finally got out of hospital. These stories were always my secret, but they helped me get out of hospital and have fun, when in the real world I could do neither.The thing is, our kids, as well ourselves, need this. The story is part of it, the characters, the challenges, the suspense, the connection to the emotions in the tale. It all works on our brain and our being.

Overdrafts are rising at an alarming rate and several Scottish farmers have already sold off sows to cut losses.The pig sector encountered signicant disruption during the Covid- pandemic which affected processing capacity and saw the partial closure of Scotland’s largest pig abattoir facility at Brechin.Much to the disappointment of NFU Scotland, several major retailers have continued to stock signicant volumes of imported pork, undermining, the union says, home production.And the dramatic spike in animal feed prices in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has also signicantly increased the scale of current losses on pig farms.It is in the interests of Scottish consumers, processors, and retailers, adds the union, that farmgate prices for pigs rise immediately to stave off a rapid rate of herd liquidations.Speaking on behalf of NFU Scotland, Mr Wyllie thanked the Cabinet Secretary for the pig hardship scheme in Scotland, established following the Covid-driven closure of the Brechin abattoir, but called on her to consider further immediate, direct support for the sector to ensure a critical mass of production was preserved.He also asked for the Scottish Government to consider an ‘Ongoers’ loan scheme to help financially support those who saw their future in the industry.NFU Scotland called on the Scottish Government to seek greater retailer support for Scottish pork, highlighting that a small percentage increase in the volume of home-produced pork on supermarket shelves would make a considerable dference.Help in re-establishing the Chinese export licence at Brechin, lost because of the Covid outbreak at the plant, would also expand the market opportunities for Scottish pig producers.At a UK level, NFU Scotland called for the Scottish Government to push Westminster on the need for “proper border controls” to monitor pork imports and for the English language requirements for overseas butchers looking to come to the UK to work in the staff-strapped processing sector to be relaxed."},{"url":null,"title":"six-county-schools-come-together-climate-change-event","story":"Teams of  pupils had to produce a plan for a product or initiative and an accompanying poster and presentation, which was made to a judging .Belhaven Hill School hosted the event, which was attended by pupils from Gordonstoun Junior School, Strathallan Prep School, Ardvreck, Fettes Prep and Cargilfield, earlier this month.The categories for the climate change event were defined by the annual Earthshot Prize, with each team choosing from: the restoration and protection of nature air cleanliness ocean revival waste-free living and climate action.Olly Langton, Belhaven Hill headmaster, said: “We want to ensure our pupils know that they can have a signicant impact on their environment now and in the future.“So my we Rosie and I came up with the idea of developing a Community of Prep and Primary Schoolsin Scotland to energise the children and bring them together to form an alliance to protect the things they love.“We were also keen to involve members of the local Dunbar community, where there is a strong environmental ethos which encourages collaboration.”The teams presented to a  of judges from the sustainability sector: Jonathan Hodges, senior innovation engineer at Wave Energy Scotland Duncan Lang, senior environment specialist at the Asian Development Bank and Izzy Heard, technical officer for the Climate Disclosure Project.The lists introduced themselves before watching each -minute presentation and giving immediate feedback.The teams completed a number of environmentally themed talks and activities, while Surfers Against Sewage encouraged youngsters to ‘Think Global Act Local’.“It was a pleasure to hear the great ideas and passionate presentations from this next generation of climate-aware thinkers,” said Mr Hodges.“The projects started by these students have already created positive change in their schools and communities, and I have no doubt they will follow-up with more.”In the afternoon, pupils took part in the Scottish Prep Schools Debating Championship – the motion challenged the children to consider whether short-haul flights should be banned.Edinburgh’s Cargilfield triumphed in both competitive elements of the day.The prize for outstanding inidual award on the day went to a pupil from Ardvreck, who went away with a voucher for a surfing lesson at Belhaven Bay, thanks to the generosity of CoastCoast.The next day, the bay was also the location for the first ForthSHORE beach clean by pupils from Belhaven with GreenTweed Eco.All the children took away a bird box, thanks to the East Lothian Primary Schools Bird Box Project, sponsored by ArdMoor, and a certicate.The next stage of the venture is for all of the schools to take part in a joint fundraising venture in the summer term.

Poverty is very much still with us, even within our most well-off communities. East Lothian Council has an updated poverty strategy and the local area partnerships have had specic funding to tackle poverty and inequalities.The pandemic, Brexit and the war in Ukrainehave all added to the pressures on prices of le’s basics, from food to transport and utilities. A rural area like ours has many who rely on heating oil, which is now about £ a litre. Many in the villages have no public transport and need to run a car.I attend the East Lothian Friendly Food Network – a council-supported network of those involved in food from across the county. Many of those who attend are from the county’s foodbanks and community pantries.The Scottish Government recently ran a consultation on how the need for foodbanks may be ended. However, all facilities in East Lothian report growing calls for support.Those needing help include, as well as those on benefits, increasing numbers of those on low pay who find that the cost of basics is a growing proportion of their weekly income.There have been mounting calls for food that does not need cooking. There are increasing requests for help to pay for gas and electricity. The charges to those on prepaid meters are higher and the top-ups on a card last for much less time than before.One organisation has been giving hot water bottles as it’s cheaper to boil a kettle to fill a bottle than turn the heating on. Organisations across the county are arranging free community meals. Breakfast club provision for children is expanding to ensure children do not go to school hungry.I recently attended a national conference where the cost of living crisis was debated. The experience identied in East Lothian is replicated across the UK.The Chancellor’s Spring Statement could have given much more help than it did. Benefits and state pension remain lagging behind the rate of inflation and could have been increased VAT could have been reduced on fuel for heating, lighting and cooking the uplt in Universal Credit could have been restored the increase in National Insurance waived. Sadly, those with the least income are those who lost out and will continue to see the cost of living eating into their weekly money pot.In the meantime, residents can continue to support the many excellent local organisations offering support, whether as donations of food, money or volunteering time. They remain a vital leline for some of the most vulnerable in all our communities.Jacquie Bell Belhaven"},{"url":null,"title":"reveals-north-berwick-one-uks-best-seaside-towns","story":"The town received an overall rating of %.The list was compiled by reviews from more than , visitors who gave feedback on their recent trips to seaside towns, villages and resorts.Destinations were rated on their beaches, attractions, value for money, peace and quiet, and scenery.North Berwick scored the following for these categories:Beach:  Attractions:  Value for money:  Peace and quiet:  Scenery:  On Tripadvisor, visitors to North Berwick praise the town for its day trips, excursions and sights to see.

There is something about this trio that makes you feel they should be driving a camper van and have a dog called Scooby Doo. Whatever: after years of slight awkwardness they have gelled nicely.The first of nine regional visits was to the Highlands. The one-bedroom Lorne Cottage in Fort William is possibly the smallest home there has been in the competition. Homeowners Ciara and Arran were fans of the show and had plans to enter one day when they had their “big house”. Opportunity had knocked now, however, much to their delight.: A sneak peek inside cutest propertyThere had already been one casualty in their battle to have a magazine standard home complete with mustard-coloured velour sofa. “We no longer let our wee dog Ghost on the bed or couch since moving here,” confessed Ciara. Across Scotland, smirking dog lovers placed bets on how long that would last.With Lorne Cottage cheered to the rafters for its “cute as a button” look it was on to The Tower, a church conversion in the Black Isle dating from the s and modernised in the s. This was home to Rachel, Rob and dog Tia, who was allowed on the couch.Rachel had wanted to downsize to a small fishing village, but ended up with a gaff that could host a medium-sized royal wedding. Stunning, but you had to wonder, with a shiver, what it cost to heat.It was the perfect location for Anna to start throwing round terms such as mis en place and Escher-like staircase . You don’t get many of those on Changing Rooms.The final stop was Loch Lann House, an th century dovecote folly in Culloden that had Michael reminiscing about the good old days when you could buy a piece of land and build what you wanted on it.Fortunately, this was a charming pile, hoaching with character as we say in the west. Home to Rory, Eilidh and the youngest of their six children, Loch Lann had Anna’s favourite thing, a hanging chair, which she rushed to try. Then again, the house had pretty much everything crammed into it, including a golden bath from Paris, so the chances of a hanging chair were good.Michael said the place called to mind a George Bernard Show quote: “Some people see the world and ask why, and there are others that dream of things that never were and say why not ” Personally, I was thinking “nightmare to clean” but each to their own.: SHOTY judge on Skyes charmsThe winner, Lorne Cottage, should answer some of the criticism levelled at previous series: that SHOTY is all about fancy homes and expensive, designer-led style, what you might call a faux fur throw and nae knickers approach to home decoration. But Lorne Cottage won largely because the judges took to its vibe straight away. Who hasn’t done that when falling for a home On to the final, then, for Ciara, Arran, and Ghost. We wish all well especially the bright yellow sofa.

His company, which is sponsoring the Estate Agency of the Year Award, has been providing research and support services to Scotland’s legal profession for  years and it continues to supply land and property searches, compile legal reports, prepare deed plans and carry out company searches for solicitors and estate agents.This year Richard predicts that those companies and iniduals who stand out against their competitors will be those who have demonstrated a sense of progress and innovation.It is that spirit of embracing new technologies and opportunities which he says have kept Millar  Bryce at the forefront of their sector and this continues to be the company’s philosophy, with its recent introduction of Landmark Scotland, part of the Landmark Information Group, which is the UK’s biggest provider of property and land searches.The commissioning of a state-of-the-art IT system has also helped Millar  Bryce to keep working seamlessly during the pandemic and to keep apace with the demands of the sector and this digital focus is also helping Landmark Scotland to provide support to the estate agency sector, which is coming under increased regulation, by building in compliance tools.Richard says he expects to see a similar innovative attitude amongst those entrants who emerge as winners at this year’s awards.“At the start of the pandemic many estate agencies and legal firms found themselves facing a digital clf, but those who have embraced the technology are now in a very strong position as we move to the next stage,” he says.This year there are  awards in total  including ‘Best Family Home ’ sponsored by DAW Interiors and Deane Harrison, Sales  Marketing Director, Daw Interiors, says: “We’re thrilled to be sponsoring the Best Family Home category – here at DAW we know the importance of family and creating a space that’s designed with them in mind. We can’t wait to see this year’s entries – we’ll be looking for a home that has adaptability, ingenuity and could suit a wide range of families.”The Residential Letting Team of the Year category is sponsored by buildings insurance claims and property reinstatement specialists, Aspray Glasgow West, and John Strange, Managing Director, says: \"Here at Aspray Glasgow West much of our business comes from letting agents and we feel that we share the same core values, that is that a tenant and a landlord are people and they need to looked after as people, taking into account their inidual needs and the needs of the property they share. We are looking for entrants that go that extra mile to make sure both tenants and landlords are put first at all times no matter the situation.”The Best Luxury Home categoryis sponsored by property management company, Ross  Liddell, and Alec Cassidy, director, says: “We are absolutely delighted to be associated with the Herald Property Awards once again. Over the year Best Luxury Home category has seen some very interesting and erse winners. It has been the perfect complement for Ross  Liddell and we are very much looking forward to meeting this year’s category entrants in person.”Meanwhile the Best Show Home category is sponsored by DAW Signs.Managing Director, Gary Daw, says: “We’re absolutely delighted to be sponsoring the Best Show Home category this year – as a business that specialises in signage and fit-outs, we’ve worked with many property developers on their show home designs. We understand both the strategy and creativity that goes into the perfect show home and can’t wait to see this year’s entries.”Other categories in the awards, of which STAR Recruitment is one of the sponsors, include Best Apartment, Best Renovation Conversion and Affordable Housing Development of the Year and, new for , the Green Housing Award.The awards ceremony will take place at Doubletree by Hilton in Glasgow and full details of all of this year’s categories and how to enter can be found at https:newsquestscotlandevents events heraldpropertyawards "},{"url":null,"title":"national-insurance-increase-mean","story":"Employees, businesses and the self-employed will pay an extra .p in the pound - with the extra tax set to be spent by the UK Government on social care.Mitigation for some lower earners is not set to come into force until July when the threshold at which people start paying NI contributions will be raised by £ . The . percentage point increase means that annual earnings above £, will be liable for .% of contributions, while the rate for those earing above the £, threshold will be .%. The increase comes despite pressure on the government to postpone it amid cost of living increases as energy, food and fuel prices all grow.National Insurance is paid by employees on their wages with employers paying extra contributions for staff and the self-employed pay it based on their profits. The rise in NI contributions takes effect on April , however as part of plans announced in the Chancellors Spring Statement workers will be allowed to earn more before they start paying the tax. This move, taking effect in July, will mean that anyone earning less than £, will pay less on National Insurance in the  to  tax year.Without the measures given in the latest mini-budget, National Insurance would have risen for those in the lowest incomes. Here is what the yearly contributions breakdown will look like:The Health Secretary has defended the decision to hike up national insurance for millions of workers as he argued it is “right that we pay for what we are going to use as a country”.Sajid Javid told Sky News: “It kicks in today, the new health and social care levy. All of the funding raised from it is going to go towards the extra £ billion we are going to put in over the next three years to health and social care.“It’s going to pay in the NHS for activity levels that are some % of pre-pandemic, it’s going to be nine million more scans, tests and procedures, meaning people will get seen a lot earlier.“Why is any of this necessary, whether it is for health or social care  It’s because of the impact of the pandemic. We know it is unprecedented. It has been the biggest challenge in our letime. The impact of that is going to continue for many years.”He added: “You asked me about the fairness of it. When we spend money on public services, whether it’s NHS or anything , for that matter, the money can only come from two sources. You raise it directly for people today, that’s through taxes, or you borrow it, which essentially you are asking the next generation to pay for it.“I think it is right that we pay for what we are going to use as a country but we do it in a fair way.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

Good teams tend to use that.“The game was slightly more open then we wished but in the end we scored and I think everyone in the room would agree we could have scored more goals and should have.“We would have wished we didn’t give them the opportunity to come back in the game.“It was an away game in the Champions League quarter-final andthat was easy something would be wrong with the competition.” vw,vw,px, px\"Benfica fans created an intense atmosphere in Lisbon Victory equalled a club record of five successive away wins in the competition first set in , but also matched in  when the club played three Champions League qualiers.However, Klopp will not take theleg for granted as his side’s quest for an unprecedented quadruple took another step forward.“We were two goals up at half-time today and we knew it was not easy,” he added.“Benfica really wanted to go for it. Now they come to Anfield and we have to use that.”Klopp made six changes for the game, resting the likes of Joel Matip ahead of Sunday’s top-of-the-table trip to face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.But the manager said that match had not been in his thoughts in Portugal.“I didn’t think a second until now about the City game, so I couldn’t make changes for the game,” he said.A good result to take back to Anfield.

Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs.

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.

Convicted of “harming by magical means” they narrowly avoided a death sentence.“Research suggests that Mary Dunbar’s symptoms of bewitchment were demonic possession: fits, swearing, throwing Bibles, vomiting household objects and trances.”The accused women were also alleged to have attacked her in spirit form, but there are strong suspicions Dunbar was faking her possession.“Being possessed allowed her to misbehave without consequence, move from invisibility to notoriety within her community and attack her elders at will,” Dr Sneddon continued.“Dunbar chose to blame her possession on the witchcraft of the Presbyterian Islandmagee women because they had reputations locally as witches and failed to meet contemporary standards of female behaviour and beauty.“Some were physically disabled, others swore and drank alcohol. All were poor. The local male authorities believed Dunbar’s version of events because she was beautul, educated and from a respected family. The accusations were also used to further local political goals at a time of intense party political conflict between the two main political parties of the day, the Whigs and the Tories.“From a modern perspective we might see the conviction as unjust, but from a historical point of view, there was nothing unjust about it. The women were tried under a law, according to due legal process and convicted by a jury,” he said.“We have a timeless fascination with witches and witchcraft,” he added. “It’s easy to forget that it was a crime in most places in Europe until the th century, when an accusation of witchcraft could have terrible consequences.”Dr McCollum, a leading authority on the use of creative arts and modern media to bring history to le, said the project showcases the importance of visual arts and how it complements the understanding, commemorating and recording of historical events.“We decided that a visual verbal format could enrich the public’s understanding of iniduals weighed down and destroyed by the past: the graphic novel is well placed to open our eyes to erased chapters from our past,” she said.Supported by a website, video game, original score, and virtual reality experience, the project brings an important part of Ireland’s cultural heritage to le.The website acts as a gateway to an online game, where the user takes the role of a witch-finder and explores the moral choices involved in accusing someone of witchcraft in .Related topicsUniversity of UlsterMore On University of Ulster PremiumTaoiseach gives terror threats short shrt during low-key trip across borderDerry Girls creator Lisa McGee honoured at Ulster University ceremony PremiumBlackout: What would a full-scale cyber attack on Northern Ireland look like  PremiumJon TongeOpinionBurnham and Rotheram united Manchester and Liverpool, so anything’s possible for Belfast PremiumViewpointOpinionNot much help with cost of living crisisMost ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayVideo: Police attend west Belfast security alertPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesLatest EducationTaoiseach: We must do better to create a fairer education system in Northern Ireland’s schoolsJon TongeOpinionUniversities fail to make the grade on tackling outdated traditionsViewpointOpinionIntegrated schools failure shames NINI schools facing drop in psychological support servicesNorthern Ireland schools are ‘too afraid’ to promote Covid jabsLatestRonald Koeman to succeed Louis van Gaal as Holland boss after  World CupRory McIlroy: Patience goes against my instincts, but I must rein it in to win Masters and clinch Career Grand SlamJoe Gormley’s double helps Cltonville see off Portadown and crank up Irish Premiership title heat on LinfieldNorthern Ireland confident we can rattle big guns Austria once again, insists Rebecca McKennaRobert Baloucoune now fit and raring to go for Ulster’s European battles with Toulouse, reveals Dan Soper,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We do what we do because we care about people and not for any reward but nevertheless it’s still very much appreciated to receive such recognition and also to keep the Samaritans’ service in the public’s mind.“However settled our lives appear to be now, none of us know when we might need to pick up the phone and dial  ,” Mrs Cunningham said.“Samaritans isn’t about just a few people, it’s about being part of a large team with a common bond to be there when perhaps no-one  is, and to provide that very basic human need — having someone to listen.”The Samaritans can also be contacted via online chat at www.samaritans.orgMost ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayVideo: Police attend west Belfast security alertPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesLatest Northern IrelandJoe Gormley’s double helps Cltonville see off Portadown and crank up Irish Premiership title heat on LinfieldNorthern Ireland confident we can rattle big guns Austria once again, insists Rebecca McKennaRobert Baloucoune now fit and raring to go for Ulster’s European battles with Toulouse, reveals Dan SoperIrish Cup plunged into further doubt as Glentoran set to seek arbitration case over expulsion from competitionNI teenager Zara Preston promotes farming to a new generation on TikTokLatestRory McIlroy: Patience goes against my instincts, but I must rein it in to win Masters and clinch Career Grand SlamJoe Gormley’s double helps Cltonville see off Portadown and crank up Irish Premiership title heat on LinfieldNorthern Ireland confident we can rattle big guns Austria once again, insists Rebecca McKennaRobert Baloucoune now fit and raring to go for Ulster’s European battles with Toulouse, reveals Dan SoperIrish Cup plunged into further doubt as Glentoran set to seek arbitration case over expulsion from competition,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One candidate is standing and he has as much hope of getting elected as Michelle O’Neill has of securing the leadership of the DUP.“It’s the last throw of the dice for Northern Ireland Conservatives. They’re about to become an extinct species. The party’s failure to deal with the isive and obnoxious Northern Ireland Protocol is to blame forelectoral demise.“My former party has driven a coach and four through UK sovereignty. They’ve uncoupled Northern Ireland from the rest of the kingdom and have failed to grasp the enormity of their actions.”Mr Dunlop said it was time for political change: “What Northern Ireland needs is a middle ground party that is unashamedly pro-Union — and no, that’s not the Alliance Party — that’s prepared to work without tribal affiliation for all our people.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “Tens of thousands of people don’t bother to vote any longer and we have to ask why. They want something that is relevant and meaningful that meets their needs.“They couldn’t care less about a border poll or the colour of flags. They want to get on with their lives and do the best they can for their families. They want change, meaningful change that gives them the space to be whatever they want to be within the Union.”Mr Dunlop quit the party last October claiming that locally it was “run more like a supper club than a properly organised political machine”.He accused the Tories nationally of failing to enthusiastically back the operation here because the leadership didn’t want to upset the political status quo.A fortnight ago, selected Conservative candidate Gary Hynds resigned over his party’s stance on the Irish Sea border. He is now contesting Lagan Valley as an independent.The Lisburn-based businessman claimed the protocol had “done more to edge Northern Ireland out of the Union than  years of republican terrorism”.Mr Hynds said: “Northern Ireland Conservatives are schizophrenic on what is a fundamental point. Some seem to think you can half oppose and half support it, depending on which constituency you find yourself in.“They are asking the electorate to buy into a dangerous mixed message. The damage the protocol is doing has to be recognised.“It has undermined Northern Ireland’s place within the Union and needs to be jettisoned.“The party locally doesn’t see it that way and thinks it can play politics with something that strikes at the very heart of our Britishness.“The Conservatives are a beaten docket here. They have no credibility and, in my view, are beyond the point of recovery. A barely discernible pulse is all that’s left.“The brand is close to being a dead duck.”Most ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayVideo: Police attend west Belfast security alertPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesLatest Northern IrelandJoe Gormley’s double helps Cltonville see off Portadown and crank up Irish Premiership title heat on LinfieldNorthern Ireland confident we can rattle big guns Austria once again, insists Rebecca McKennaRobert Baloucoune now fit and raring to go for Ulster’s European battles with Toulouse, reveals Dan SoperIrish Cup plunged into further doubt as Glentoran set to seek arbitration case over expulsion from competitionNI teenager Zara Preston promotes farming to a new generation on TikTokLatestAndy Kirk: My son Makenzie must work hard to achieve his dream after Hearts debut and time with Northern Ireland Under-sAshes winner Ian Bell joins Derbyshire for stint as batting consultantGeneral strike shuts down services across GreeceOver-s in Ireland to be offered another Covid- booster jabTwitter launching edit button would be a ‘mistake’, former executive warns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Now I’m hitting nearly k and it is mental.”Around five years ago, Zara started rearing her own flock of Beltex sheep, which according to the Beltex Sheep Society, “is a terminal sire breed which is sought after for its double-muscle and the hindquarters which are its outstanding feature”.She does this with the help of her nine-year-old sister Leah, and in , she won the overall prize for butchers’ lambs at the Ulster Beef and Lamb Championships, which led to UTV asking her and her family to star in their hit farming series, Rare Breed.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “It [sheep farming] was just sort of a way of le. I didn’t know any dferent, it’s built into me,” Zara continued.“I was working out of my dad’s flock and I thought ‘I might as well go do this here’. Now my target is to try and beat his top price for a ram, so that’s what me and my sister are trying to do!”The agricultural influencer is part of the Young Farmers’ Club Of Ulster and this summer, will be attending her first Bank of Ireland Open Farm Weekend to help engage and teach those from urban areas of Northern Ireland more about the importance of farming.She said she’s excited at the prospect of “seeing the smiles” of children who maybe haven’t seen farm animals before.“I wouldn’t think twice about going to see a pet lamb but [imagine it] for somebody who hasn’t done that before!” she laughed.This is the first time since  that farms are able to host in-person for Open Farm Weekend and  farms from across the province are looking forward to throwing open their gates and welcoming visitors inside, from Friday, June  to Sunday, June .Many young farmers who have taken to showcasing their industry on social media will be taking part in this year’s three-day event, demonstrating the power of the internet in highlighting NI’s local talent, as last year the virtual Open Farm Weekend had a total online reach of almost , since the event launched in April .Zara added that one of her most viewed TikTok clips shows her selling ‘Glenpark Gilly’ — one of the sheep from her flock — in the ring at a mart.“I thought I might as well put it up to show that it doesn’t always have to be the old boys in the ring, I can do it as well.“When you get out and get to know everybody in the sector, there’s a lot more young people in farming than you think.“I think we just need more girls to show that we can do it as well. It’s not easy with lambing and everything, but we get there!”The -year-old added that TikTok has been a great way to highlight the benefits of farming to a new audience, and brands such as luxury British country clothing store Fairfax  Favor have even asked Zara to collaborate to promote their products on her TikTok page. “When I go out, people look to get photos with me and I’ve actually had a farm in New Zealand contacting me about bloodlines within the sheep.“They would like to go down our bloodlines because they’ve seen me on TikTok!”Most ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayVideo: Police attend west Belfast security alertPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesLatest Northern IrelandJoe Gormley’s double helps Cltonville see off Portadown and crank up Irish Premiership title heat on LinfieldNorthern Ireland confident we can rattle big guns Austria once again, insists Rebecca McKennaRobert Baloucoune now fit and raring to go for Ulster’s European battles with Toulouse, reveals Dan SoperIrish Cup plunged into further doubt as Glentoran set to seek arbitration case over expulsion from competitionPolice recover viable device during overnight security alert in west BelfastLatestAndy Kirk: My son Makenzie must work hard to achieve his dream after Hearts debut and time with Northern Ireland Under-sOver-s in Ireland to be offered another Covid- booster jabTwitter launching edit button would be a ‘mistake’, former executive warnsFire in Covid ward leaves one dead in GreeceRonald Koeman to succeed Louis van Gaal as Holland boss after  World Cup,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These figures will allow residents to judge town hall bosses for themselves and hold their local councils to account,” he said.All  NI councils were asked to comment on the report. A BCC spokesperson said the salaries for the chief executives of the councils were set independently during local government reforms in  and the salary takes into account the fact that the council is the largest.“It is also benchmarked against other comparable posts in the public sector. The salaries of directors in Belfast City Council were also set after an independent evaluation of the job roles and the scale of the s the directors are responsible for in a city authority,” the spokesperson added.Antrim and Newtownabbey also said salaries are in line with the salary banding agreed for local government here.Derry City and Strabane District Council said its chief executive’s pay is in line with the appropriate local government salary scale for the post.Ards and North Down Borough Council added: “[Salaries] are benchmarked against other comparable public sector posts and are proportionately lower than in England, Scotland and Wales.’Causeway Coast and Glen Borough Council said: “Council senior officer salaries are set at a national level in England, therefore the council has little influence on these rates of pay.”Related topicsBelfast City CouncilDerry City and Strabane District CouncilMid and East Antrim Borough CouncilCauseway Coast and Glens Borough CouncilLisburn and Castlereagh City CouncilNewry, Mourne and Down District CouncilAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough CouncilArds and North Down Borough CouncilFermanagh and Omagh District CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBelfast City Council looking to establish Poverty Commission amid cost of living crisisOverflowing bins leading to ‘health crisis’ for residents in HolylandBelfast to hold annual Troubles reflection day on June Ulster Unionist Dr John Kyle in call for Belfast to become a ‘City of Sanctuary’ for refugees and asylum seekersBelfast City Council to host ‘Day of Reflection’ to acknowledge pain and hurt caused by the TroublesMost ReadIreland’s top  pubs: Three NI bars make the list of best establishments across islandTesco petrol station in Craigavon runs out of fuelJeffrey Donaldson: Problems with Brexit the fault of other partiesTeenager dies after M motorway road traffic collisionDerry shooting: Mum says son targeted in ‘horric case of mistaken identity’Top VideosPlayVideo: Police attend west Belfast security alertPlayWork continues on Primark Bank Buildings in BelfastPlayComedian makes fun of Channel  privatisation news with Derry Girls and other sketchesLatest Northern IrelandJoe Gormley’s double helps Cltonville see off Portadown and crank up Irish Premiership title heat on LinfieldNorthern Ireland confident we can rattle big guns Austria once again, insists Rebecca McKennaRobert Baloucoune now fit and raring to go for Ulster’s European battles with Toulouse, reveals Dan SoperIrish Cup plunged into further doubt as Glentoran set to seek arbitration case over expulsion from competitionNI teenager Zara Preston promotes farming to a new generation on TikTokLatestAndy Kirk: My son Makenzie must work hard to achieve his dream after Hearts debut and time with Northern Ireland Under-sAshes winner Ian Bell joins Derbyshire for stint as batting consultantGeneral strike shuts down services across GreeceOver-s in Ireland to be offered another Covid- booster jabTwitter launching edit button would be a ‘mistake’, former executive warns,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

transport and in enclosed areas “for any period of time” should wear a mask.The Sinn Féin leader and other senior party figures, including deputy leader Michelle O’Neill and senior MLA Conor Murphy, were filmed maskless walking through a large crowd of party supporters who gathered at Belfast’s Europa Hotel on Tuesday last week.A video of the event, which was to launch Sinn Féin’s Northern Ireland Assembly election campaign, was posted to Ms O’Neill’s Twitter account and shows the vast majority of attendees also not wearing masks.Five days later, Ms McDonald told RTÉ’s This Week programme: “I see a mixed bag across society now, some people are still wearing their masks and I think it’s only responsible, personally, when you’re on public transport or in enclosed areas, certainly for any period of time, that people would have their masks on.”The rally has already attracted criticism for taking place at the Europa Hotel which was bombed more than  times during the Troubles, leading to it being infamously described as the most bombed hotel in Europe.Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United, last week said: “Sinn Féin clearly don’t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe, is brazen to say the least.”Last

Department of Health, the HSE and the minister”.Sinn Féin did not respond to questions on Ms McDonald’s attendance at the rally, subsequent remarks to RTÉ or the party’s position on a mask

Photo: Mark CondrenPól Ó ConghaileApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailDublin Airport says the queuing issues that have plagued travellers in recent days improved last weekend, but it has now advised passengers to arrive three and-a-half hours before flights.If parking a car, allow a further  minutes,” the airport says. That means travellers flying even short-haul journeys at peak times, such as the early morning rush hour period, weekends or over the Easter holidays, may have to plan on arriving up to four hours before departure.“The weekend just gone saw a much-improved situation in terms of security times in both terminals at Dublin Airport,” Graeme McQueen, Media Relations Manager with the DAA, told Independent.ie. “While passenger numbers over the weekend were up on the previous weekend, the time it took passengers to get through security was manageable, with a maximum time of around  minutes in T on both Saturday and Sunday, and around  minutes in T on both days.”This was aided by the rollout of a staff taskforce, the airport says, “which is seeing all DAA staff picking up shts in customer-facing roles within the terminals”.This all-hands-to-pump approach is seeing staff fulfil tasks such as queue management, the giving out of general customer service advice, tray replacement at security and much more.”Read MoreDublin Airport:  tips for tackling the security queues – from ‘evening before’ check-in to a ‘VIP terminal’Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Live security times have also been ed to its dublinairport website, and will follow on the app in an update later this week, it says. It follows a period of y security delays for passengers in both terminals, caused by a shortage of security staff, Covid-related absences and a rebound in travel that has exceeded DAA expectations y pc, or , passengers a day, according to CEO Dalton Philips.The results have seen queues lasting hours in some cases, with some passengers reporting missed flights. The airport has also temporarily suspended its Fast Track system, and says demand for car parks is “very high and “likely to sell out” on certain days. A perfect storm,” Mr Philips has called it.Staff have been working in stressful conditions. One passenger spat in the face of a security staff member and was arrested, The Sunday Independent reported. Lots of businesses are experiencing hiring issues and Covid-related shortages, and UK airports like Heathrow and Manchester experienced similar delays this weekend, while easyJet was forced to cancel over  flights on foot of staffing issues.However, Dublin Airport’s contracts – which only guarantees a -hour week and € wage for new security hires – have also been cited as a factor, as has its failure to predict passenger numbers when it had clear sight of recently introduced summer schedules.Previously, Dublin Airport’s rule of thumb was to advise passengers to arrive two hours before short-haul flights, and three hours before long-haul departures. As air travel picks up and the Easter holidays approach, however, the airport is only going to get busier. April  is expected to be “peak day” of the Easter period. Ryanair has begun to roll out what it says is its largest ever summer schedule for Dublin this year, while Aer Lingus is ramping up its transatlantic routes.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St

ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who

marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August  when the petition was formally presented, and shortly afterwards the council voted overwhelmingly to adopt the pathway, subject to legal opinions.However, for the next  months no progress was made on the matter until the council appointed a countryside officer in August . He prepared a report on the footpath, which came before the council earlier this month when it was decided not to adopt itAfterwards a statement from some of the local people seeking the right-of-way said the footpath passes over land belonging to  dferent families and only one has an objection to the council adopting it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Good Morning Down co","story":"THE head of one of the districtrsquos leading charities is officially stepping down from her role next month.Linda Baker has been Good Morning Downrsquos co-ordinator for the past  years and has watched the organisation mdash which provides a telephone befriending service to elderly and vulnerable people across the district mdash increases its operation considerably.The charity provides a valuable leline service to many people across the district, with its hardworking volunteers in regular contact with those who feel vulnerable or at risk, making telephone calls to members at an agreed time each morning.Linda said the service was especially important during the height of the coronavirus pandemic with the deadly virus unfortunately curtailing get-togethers that were organised for clients.Working in partnership with the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, the South Eastern Trust and the Housing Executive, the charity has also received invaluable support from the Allen Lane Foundation and and Halax Community Foundation.ldquoWhen I joined Good Morning Down there were four volunteers making calls to around  people.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

A hereditary head of state is a peculiar form of hierarchy that few new states would choose to adopt. Butyou have a successful existing such system, as Britain does, then it can work very well.The throne then passes from one monarch to his or her heir on death, and so on, indefinitely.The Prince of Wales can be a controversial and political figure but few people would dispute that he has demonstrated keen awareness of the duty that comes with being a king-in-waiting. Prince Charles is now in his early s, but shows the sort of energy levels that his own parents did past retirement age, as evident in his recent visit to Northern Ireland. He has been next in line to the throne for  years and has more than proven his suitability for that role.The Prince of Wales has good reason to be proud of his own heir, William, but the conscientious younger prince’s time will come, and there is no need to hasten it.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe owner of Coaltown Coffee was still just a teenager when he started up his business – then called Roasted Joe’s – in  after leaving secondary school with no qualications.Nearly a decade after dad Gordon helped him build his first roaster, Coaltown’s products are being savoured around the world and the company is continuing to go from strength to strength.With the support of Gordon and mum Jennine, Scott has made a big mark on his hometown of Ammanford, with their Foundry Road roastery popular among locals and those from further afield.Given that his parents used to run their own café and older generations of the family were grocers and restaurateurs, it is perhaps no surprise that the coffee industry has been Scott’s calling.Great-grandfather Ben, a miner in the former coal town, inspired the rebranding of the company, and Scott hasn’t looked back since ditching the Roasted Joe’s name.“The mining industry was a big part of everyday le in this area and that’s gone, it’s been completely wiped out,” he told the Welsh Business Heroes webinar.“It was really impactful, and the idea of that industry that’s no longer here was very much the inspiration behind what we wanted to do with the brand, which is where the name came from.“We were doing some research into the mining industry and one of the terms for what they called coal was ‘black gold’.“Coal gave a massive amount of employment and industry to the area, and, when you look at coffee, black gold is the same term used for coffee growing regions.“They are two very dferent worlds but are tied together through black gold.”In , Coaltown became one of the first coffee companies in the UK to be B Corp certied, meaning they are committed to prioritising the environment and society in how they do business..removeAnd that ethical approach to doing things has, according to Scott, always been at the forefront of his mind as an entrepreneur.“We went on a trip to New York to see my favourite roasteries,” he said.“I can’t stress enough how massively influential that trip was. You really do need to go somewhere and soak it all in because it just inspires you and makes you have a completely dferent approach to what you do.“That’s where I first encountered Square as a brand before they opened in the UK, and it was also where I first encountered B Corp.“It’s a universally adopted accreditation which allows you to implement a lot of sustainability ethics into one brand.“B Corp is a really good thing for giving you a general overview of everything you do as a business.“What B Corp means is that you are putting your planet before profit and your business as a force for good and change before anything .“I don’t think any business opening as a fresh start-up today can open without that in mind. It’s not a tradable landscape for you to be able to grow within.“You have to have that ethical approach to everything you do.“B Corp, as a brand, really summed up everything we were as a business “We were awarded that in December  and announced it in late January , and we were the first specialty roastery in UK to get it so we were very proud of that.“It was a big feat because we were up against some really big players in the UK.“We all have the ambition to be ethical and do the best we can, but to get that certication first was a really big thing for us.“It’s looking at how you run your business from the ground up.“As a brand, we’ve been purpose driven, so it’s about how we can bring a new industry to our hometown, and now post-industrial towns across the UK.“It has always been our intention to have an ethical brand.“Essentially, the coal industry is the opposite of what we are, we’re trying to be the opposite of what the coal industry was with fossil fuels and bad carbon.”Watch the Welsh Business Heroes episode featuring Scott James of Coaltown Coffee in its entirety here - www.youtube watch vKZFsjhVei article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"proposal to use dunluce centre sale proceeds for parker avenue pitch upgrade ","story":"Boystabbed in bottle attack in Lurgan   Murder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriagewayNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPoliticsCouncilProposal to use Dunluce Centre sale proceeds for Parker Avenue pitch upgradeA Portrush youth football team are hoping that the sale of the Dunluce Centre will help their calls for upgraded facilities at their pitch.By Una CulkinThursday, st March , : am  \"       \"  Cllr John McAuleyPortrush Youths FC said they were forced to halt training in February of this year due to the condition of playing facilities at the Council-run Parker Avenue site.Speaking at the time, club Chairman Jason Quigley compared the pitch to a ‘swamp’ and added: “We face the same issue every winter and nothing is ever done about it and we are paying for the privilege of playing on this.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The message came at an event hosted by Ulster Bank ahead of its sponsorship of this year’s Balmoral Show where senior figures from within the bank outlined a number of key issues facing the local agri-food sector and reaffirmed Ulster Bank’s commitment to supporting the industry. Ulster Bank Senior Agriculture Manager, Cormac McKervey, and the bank’s Chief Economist, Northern Ireland, Richard Ramsey, updated media, including members of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists, as well as other stakeholders, on the overall health of the local farming and food sectors and related economic issues. They were joined by Ulster Bank Head of Northern Ireland, Mark Crimmins, who encouraged those in the audience to grasp the opportunities presented by a new, greener economy. Speaking at the bank’s annual briefing held in Stock Kitchen, above St. George’s Market, Mr Crimmins said: “The agri-food sector is a key pillar of the Northern Ireland economy, and we remain strongly committed to supporting it through the many challenges it currently faces. In particular, we want to work in partnership with the sector to tackle climate change and provide the tools and expertise agri-businesses need to fulfil their green ambitions. “As a leading financier of renewable energy projects, we have recently launched two new green propositions including green loans and green asset finance options for qualying SMEs. All of our business managers now undergo specialist climate training and are now fully equipped to assist customers, including those in the agri-sector, on their sustainability journey.” Cormac McKervey, Senior Agriculture Manager, Ulster Bank, said: “Undoubtedly, farmers in Northern Ireland are operating through very challenging times and the pace and scale at which input costs continue to rise is alarming. Farm gate prices for beef, lamb, grain, and milk are at an all-time high but margins remain static and, in some cases, are actually lower than this time last year. “Many farmers are having to manage their cash flow extremely carefully, and while profitability has yet to dip, certain sub-sectors of the industry are being exposed to greater risks. Pig farmers are facing the most signicant impact with input costs rocketing and the price for pork falling throughout the year. “Land prices remain strong, and the demand is still high, yet we expect the majority of farmers to adopt a holding position rather than look to expand, given the other budgetary pressures currently facing the sector. Perhaps when Tier  approvals are received, then we will see an increase in overall capital investment.” At the event, Richard Ramsey presented his annual Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index, which shows that the price of all items making up the cooked breakfast gauge rose in the year to the end of February, using the UK Retail Price Index . Milk saw the biggest price increase in the index with a rise of .% in the -months. There were also strong rises in the prices of a range of other items including eggs , butter , mushrooms , breadand sausages . Overall, the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index – the average inflation rate of the items included - rose by a robust .% in the past year, meaning that the index is at its highest level since March . This was the peak of the Ulster Fry Index and coincided with another cost-of-living crisis. Looking back even further - since the last recession , the Ulster Bank Ulster Fry Index has risen a whopping %. Richard Ramsey says that the Ulster Fry Index contains a more important message this year than ever. “Food makes up a signicant proportion of household spending. ‘Food and drink’ is also a key sector of the Northern Ireland economy. So, understanding how the price of food items is changing gives us some insight into both the current state of consumer finances, and also some of the challenges facing the agri-food industry,” Mr. Ramsey says. “The fact that we are now in a new cost of living crisis means that creating understanding of price rises and cost pressures and where they are coming from is essential. What the Ulster Fry Index is telling us is that the prices of everyday items like milk and bread are rising really strongly at a time whenever households are also having to contend with big rises in their household energy bills. “The reality though is that the Ulster Fry Index is only going to go one way in the foreseeable future, and that is up. Given the surge in energy prices already, alongside the disruption to the global food supply-chain stemming from the war between Russia and Ukraine, the Ulster Fry Index is expected to experience double-digit inflation over the next  months. This would see the Ulster Fry Index hit a new record high,” he continues. He adds: “Exactly this time two years ago, we thought we were entering a food crisis. People were stockpiling food items in the expectation of supply shortages and empty shelves, despite repeated reassurances from the industry and politicians. The reality was that the food and retail sectors pulled out all the stops to keep the supply lines open and to keep us fed. Today, two years on, though, a new and worrying food crisis is on the cards for dferent reasons. Russia and Ukraine are two of the most important producers and exporters of agricultural commodities in the world. Overall, the two countries export one in eight of all calories traded worldwide. What Saudi Arabia is to oil, Ukraine and Russia are to cereal crops. And don’t forget that cereal crops aren’t just a direct source of food, they are also a major indirect source of food in that they are fed to the livestock that we then consume. Food supply problems will further fuel economic nationalism due to the scramble for food security, meaning the further unwinding of globalisation, or de-globalisation. Indeed, such is the concern about the supply of food that countries are now hoarding and stockpiling by banning exports.
