For it to be a successful night, remember it’s all in the planning ... Since coronavirus has shrunk our social spheres, intimate garden parties have become something of a trend. Thanks to street-wide WhatsApp chats and local volunteer groups, eclectic new friendships have been forged – and as the weather’s improved, online quizzes with distant relatives have segued into alfresco drinks with new and nearby friends.While we’re all being urged to stay alert, the easing of lockdown rules means we can meet up with more of our friends. Outside the permitted bubbles in each area, the 2-metre rule remains in place in Scotland and Wales, while iniduals in England and Northern Ireland must stay at least 1 metre apart.But groups of friends can now gather together outside – any sized group from up to two households can meet in Wales up to six people from different households in England, with no limit on people from two different households in Northern Ireland, groups of up to 30 people can meet and in Scotland, up to 15 people from up to five different households can meet outside per day – all while keeping a distance.All of which means summer isn’t cancelled, it just looks somewhat different to how we imagined – but we can still get ready to brush up on our barbecuing and hosting skills.Now it’s trickier to go to the corner shop for extras, planning is of the essence. Here are our tips for hosting the perfect post-lockdown barbecue, and enjoying a safely sociable summer.Be considerateThe first rule of new-normal socialising is to be respectful of everyone’s boundaries. You might not mind sharing food with your guests, but others might be more anxious. Find out what everyone’s comfortable with before you plan your party – and if one of your friends would prefer to bring their own food, be prepared to be OK with that.Shop smartThanks to socially distanced shopping, the etiquette of putting on a barbecue has changed, too – it’s now perfectly reasonable to ask people to bring their own food or drink if they want something specific. Meanwhile, make sure you provide enough basics, to avoid a dash to the shops, mask in hand. You can find barbecue calculators online that will tell you how much meat, veg, side dishes and drink to buy depending on the number of people attending.Buy localWhile your online shop is ideal for stocking up on basics, a barbecue is the perfect excuse to explore your local area and uncover some hidden foodie gems. From artisan ciabatta rolls and locally produced meats, to small-batch chutneys, cheeses and ale, it’s a great time to support the independent stores reopening after lockdown. As well as boosting the economy, buying locally sourced produce keeps your carbon footprint clean, too.Stock up on masksJust as you’d make sure a guest didn’t drive home after a few drinks, protecting them if they have to get a cab or public transport home is equally thoughtful. Buy some masks to hand out to anyone who might suddenly need one at the end of the evening.Play it safeYou can’t control the weather – but you can make sure staying safe feels like a natural part of the party, rather than a chore. Put out plenty of hand sanitisers and wipes for guests, hand out glasses marked with their names, and hang 2-metre-long strips of bunting as a visual reminder not to mingle too closely. Spacing out your garden furniture around a central hub, such as a fire pit, will also help remind people to keep a distance without dampening the atmosphere.Create a signature dishWith more of us cooking at home than ever, it’s worth taking the time to develop a dish that will really wow your guests. Whether it’s making a lip-smacking vegan pulled “pork” (try BOSH’s for inspiration) or perfecting an all-American regional burger (make George Motz your go-to for recipes), head to your local butcher or farmers’ market, and start planning a grill everyone will remember for the right reasons.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

We refuse to attend an event if those staffing it cannot have the same basic freedoms,” they write, in the letter addressed to the board of the World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) and the 2020 Worldcon chair, Norman Cates. “We express deep concern that many members of the SFF community would be excluded.”WorldCon, where the winners of the prestigious Hugo awards are announced, has been running every year since 1946, with members of the WSFS voting for each year’s location, and for the Hugo winners. This year’s event will take place, virtually, in New Zealand on Saturday, with next year’s lined up for Washington DC. As well as Jeddah, a bid for 2022 has been submitted by Chicago.While the writers acknowledge that holding the convention in Jeddah would “open up a new world to fans who may otherwise never have an opportunity to travel there, and show solidarity with creative communities within Saudi Arabia and other Arab states”,they state that “the Saudi regime is antithetical to everything SFF stands for”.“We stand in solidarity with those who seek change in the country. And we write in protest but also in hope – that by raising awareness of the political situation in Saudi Arabia a WorldCon SA will one day be possible,” say the writers.Yasser Bahjatt, one of the science fiction authors leading JeddiCon, the Saudi bid, told the  in a statement that he was “deeply concerned” by the letter.“We believe in their right to express concerns or even distaste for a WorldCon in Saudi Arabia, but demanding that we should not be allowed to even request hosting it is absurd and unhealthy for the WorldCon in the long run,” he said. “The WorldCon already is limited in its spread as it is mainly focused on western culture countries, and as long as it is the WorldCon, it must accept all of the world.”“This does not mean that the community should not try to make the world a better place, but merely that there is a difference between advocating for change that you believe would make the world a better place, and demanding that the world adheres to your own moral code. When such a tone is used, it is no different than the radicals on the other side,” he added.Smith Spark said the initial response from the WSFS had been dismissive of the authors’ concerns, but that the response from readers, writers and publishers had been “astonishingly positive”.Smith Spark said that she was shocked that it had taken an inidual to raise the issue. “Our community has expressed deep solidarity with the people of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and disgust that the UK and US governments have such long and deep links with the regime. It’s the Saudi regime that is the antithesis of everything SFF should stand for, absolutely not Islam or Arabic culture to which both science and literature are hugely indebted,” she said on Tuesday. “Many in the community have also expressed outrage that a convention could be considered that would by default exclude many of the most exciting voices in the genre.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c399138b6ea9f0fd0771d97497cfb14a9871b3/0_0_3211_1928/master/3211.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=e818804f373dc59e31b41310d8453e66","title":"the guardian view on the green recovery britain is being left behind","story":"The government talks a good game when it comes to radical policymaking. But its failure to invest in a zero-carbon future tells a different storySenior figures in this government like to view themselves as insurgents against a hidebound Whitehall establishment. This is partly because Boris Johnson won the last election after pledging to “get Brexit done”, breaking the post-referendum stalemate in parliament. But it is also settled wisdom in Downing Street, and in the Treasury, that a more general shake-up is required of Britain’s body politic if it is to become more lithe and nimble, and get ahead of the game.More evidence of this desire to disrupt came on Tuesday in the form of a speech by Stephen Barclay, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Addressing a centre-right thinktank, Mr Barclay heralded a new era of state spending in which the ethos of Silicon Valley would inform departmental decision-making. In the spirit of west coast venture capitalists, government ministers and their civil servants would back schemes that took risks and which would therefore sometimes fail. The interminable delays and inveterate caution that have blighted government projects and investment would become a thing of the past. Inculcating this new Whitehall worldview is seen as fundamental to speedily delivering the “infrastructure revolution” promised by Mr Johnson at the end of last month.The rhetoric is beguilingly avant garde and dynamic (Mr Barclay talked of the Treasury’s “new radicals”). It should also be said that the prospect of a proactive industrial strategy is welcome after lost years of lazy, laissez-faire rhetoric from the likes of George Osborne. But it is ironic that while the government talks a good game, it risks falling grievously behind Britain’s competitors in one of the growth areas that will define the future. The progress made towards a post-Covid-19 green recovery for Britain is proceeding at a snail’s pace. By contrast, Germany, France, South Korea and others have unveiled plans that will pump vast amounts of government money into developing a low-carbon economy. Last month, Berlin announced a £9bn national hydrogen strategy, which it sees as a route to decarbonising transport and core domestic industries, and achieving global leadership in a new sector. Britain has yet to show anything like the same level of environmental ambition.Renowned climate experts such as Nicholas Stern and Lady Brown of Cambridge, the chair of the Carbon Trust, would like to see the establishment of a new green investment bank to generate some momentum and confidence. Lord Stern estimates that about £20bn worth of public money would be needed to set one up. This would be a certain catalyst for major private investment one recent report estimated that £5bn in public funds could attract up to £100bn in private capital for green projects. The energy minister, Kwasi Kwarteng, has declared his support for the idea. But following parliamentary recess, no decision seems likely before Rishi Sunak’s autumn statement.There is no more time to lose. As Lady Brown has pointed out, in areas such as the production of green hydrogen, Britain has world-leading innovators in a market that is still embryonic and in need of support. Given a fair wind, these companies could expand to become global players in the developing market for green technologies, as well as driving a new generation of carbon-neutral infrastructure at home. But vibrant green growth will only become a reality if government plays its part in a committed public-private partnership.According to the Committee on Climate Change, Britain is manifestly not on course to meet its legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050. The committee chair, John Gummer, told a government inquiry that this was because the “radical things’ that needed to be done to shape a green recovery were not being done. A properly funded and ambitious green investment bank could be a gamechanger. Mr Barclay’s “new radicals” should get to it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84d9152653d779735c0712474fe25121cf9a2bf2/0_96_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=265f527f9039d95147746baa28cb9bbd","title":"twitter boycott racism social media wiley newspapers","story":"Amid the anger over Wiley’s bigoted tirade, let’s not forget the newspapers that have been peddling prejudice for yearsTwitter is simultaneously many things: a means of elevating otherwise ignored voices, a platform for facilitating debate, a portal to access a bewildering array of information – and a cesspit of hatred.This weekend, the grime artist Wiley – with his half a million followers – unleashed a tirade of undiluted antisemitism on to the site over the course of two days, leading some to observe a 48-hour boycott of the social media platform to protest Twitter’s slowness to act. But it has not proved uncontroversial some users have noted that the website has long hosted unapologetic neo-Nazis such as US white supremacist Richard Spencer, so why wait for a black celebrity to make antisemitic comments to take such action? It took Twitter years to remove inflammatory far-right personalities, such as Tommy Robinson and Katie Hopkins. With a range of Jewish organisations urging a boycott and antisemitic hate crimes at a record high, I’m among those who heeded the call, while respecting the views of others who believe this is not an effective means to challenge racism.That Twitter needs to take further action is beyond doubt. On a daily basis, the site pulses with Islamophobia, anti-blackness, antisemitism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, and every other form of bigotry, often directly targeted at iniduals. As Alex Hern, the ’s technology editor notes, Twitter’s policy in this area has gradually evolved from a commitment to free speech fundamentalism, which regarded racism as a bad opinion to be challenged, to a commitment to upholding minority rights in the face of illegitimate hate speech.But it is a tech company that is “fundamentally underfunded in Silicon Valley terms”, says Hern, and is slow to develop new ideas, let alone clamp down on hate speech. This doesn’t mean Twitter should not invest in more moderators and take swifter action, particularly in a case like this one, which was so egregious because of the size of Wiley’s platform combined with the intensity and duration of his racist tirade.There is something profoundly uncomfortable about this debate, however. Twitter reflects hatred that is embedded in the nation’s social fabric as much as it incubates it. Racism and other forms of bigotry remain organising principles of British society. As the scholar Alana Lentin puts it, racism is not a moral “problem of ‘bad’ iniduals”, as the current debate on Twitter’s toxicity encourages us to believe, but a “systemic one” rooted in European colonialism, when the subjugation of African and Aboriginal peoples was justified by treating them as biologically inferior.Similarly, antisemitism consists of deadly, centuries-old conspiracy theories ingrained in European culture that present Jews as devious puppetmasters behind injustices, “which in turn drew on Christian antisemitic themes”, as Professor David Feldman notes.The systems of racism and other bigotries – rather than inidual racists and bigots – should be our starting point. Black people are discriminated against by the justice system and more likely to be condemned to lower pay and unemployment while patriarchy leaves women objectified and subjected to routine misogyny, and LGBTQ people treated as gender traitors deserving verbal or physical punishment beatings. An online platform open to all will inevitably project these wider phenomena no Twitter moderation policy, no matter how robust, can adequately counter bigotries that are systemic in our societies.Unfortunately, our public discourse prefers theatrical debates about whether a person or statement is “racist” or “not racist” to a proper reckoning with how race functions as a system of power. And power, in turn, is part of what is missing from a conversation about racism in public life that focuses on tweets rather than the powerful institutions that set the tone in any national community. Hopkins, who was banned from Twitter this year, was not a monster created by social media. She was a columnist for the Sun, where she compared migrants to cockroaches, leading to condemnation from the United Nations. She continued to fall upwards, rewarded with a column at Mail Online and a chatshow at LBC. It was the old media who built her up, generously adding to her Twitter follower count in the process: a positive feedback loop of hate.This week, a leader in the Times delivered a pious judgment on “social media and hate speech: Publish and Be Damned”. This is the newspaper that was forced to issue a correction after a series of misleading articles that began with the front page splash “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care”.Just this week, as the Twitter boycott began, one Times columnist published a piece headlined “Let’s not be afraid to challenge Traveller culture”. When this paper of record publishes articles with headlines such as “Islamophobia is a fiction to shut down debate” – written by Melanie Phillips, whose work was approvingly cited by Norwegian far-right terrorist Anders Breivik – its bigotry is considerably more dangerous than that of @barry48593 from Slough on Twitter. Its reach is far greater, and it confers respectability and permissibility on racism and bigotry.Online hatred is an urgent and growing problem, but its seriousness is not diminished by observing that powerful rightwing newspapers are this country’s most prominent platform for bigotry. Do tech firms need to do more? Yes, absolutely. But the lack of consistency in this debate risks looking like hypocrisy.When we ask who has helped to fuel the doubling of hate crimes in a five-year period, our scrutiny should not be confined to slobbering bigots hunched over computers, but should also include those with far more power and clout. Anything else misses the point."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b05318c5e7de08440637a7584949422df34ea9d6/0_241_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b29e71b5114344d9135ce187c06002a0","title":"worlds largest nuclear fusion project under assembly in france","story":"Project aims to show clean fusion power can be generated at commercial scaleThe world’s largest nuclear fusion project began its five-year assembly phase on Tuesday in southern France, with the first ultra-hot plasma expected to be generated in late 2025.The €20bn (£18.2bn) Iter project will replicate the reactions that power the sun and is intended to demonstrate fusion power can be generated on a commercial scale.

Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, said: “I believe disruptive innovation will play a key role in addressing global issues including climate change and realising a sustainable carbon-free society.”“Enabling the exclusive use of clean energy will be a miracle for our planet,” said Bernard Bigot, Iter director-general. He said fusion, alongside renewable energy, would allow transport, buildings and industry to run on electricity.Nuclear fusion releases vast amounts of energy when heavy hydrogen atoms fuse together, but this requires a temperature of 150m C, 10 times hotter than the core of the sun. The hydrogen fuel is obtained from seawater and just a few grammes is needed but huge magnets are needed to contain the plasma in doughnut-shaped vacuum chamber known as a tokamak.Like conventional nuclear fission reactors, the process itself does not produce climate-warming carbon dioxide but fusion reactors cannot meltdown and produce much less radioactive waste.The Iter project will be the first to achieve a “burning” or self-heating plasma and is expected to generate 10 times more heat than is put in, far more than any previous attempt. It will also use a significant amount of electrical energy when it is running, to power the magnets and scientific instruments, But it is intended to be a proof-of-concept of large-scale fusion, not a design for a future commercial reactor.Among the components being assembled is the 30-metre-diameter cryostat, manufactured by India, which surrounds the reactor and keeps it at the extremely low temperature required. One of the electromagnets, called the central solenoid and built by the US, will have the magnetic power to lift an aircraft carrier.There are numerous private-sector companies pursuing nuclear fusion via much smaller devices, including Tokamak Energy, based in the UK and which has raised £117m in investment. Its executive vice-chairman, David Kingham, said: “We welcome the progress at Iter which we see as a great scientific project and a major endorsement of tokamak devices.”“But we are convinced that faster progress is possible, driven by the need for more carbon-free energy and enabled by private investment, modular designs, new materials and advanced technologies,” he said. Iter engineers said their giant project is the size that proven technologies can deliver.Other nuclear fusion companies include Tri Alpha Energy, which harnesses particle accelerator technology and is working with Google, General Fusion, which uses a vortex of molten lead and lithium to contain the plasma and is backed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and First Light Fusion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41cca44ef6b983d7e6b343e70e81816da72f7c75/0_0_3650_2190/master/3650.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=ff3dda6c740c13d62e299ee49dd081e5","title":"what do the highway code proposals mean for pedestrians and cyclists","story":"Changes under consultation follow raft of cycling and walking announcements Amid the storm of Covid-19, a raft of cycling and walking announcements has landed as part of the government’s attempt to promote a healthier population, save the NHS from collapse and fend off the worst outcomes from coronavirus.The plans, which were in the pipeline before the pandemic, are good news for anyone who wants cleaner, safer roads, and residential streets that do not moonlight as rat runs for short-cutting drivers.Alongside long-awaited design guidance for cycling infrastructure, training schemes and £50 vouchers for bike repairs, there is a much-needed Highway Code review for walking and cycling. Although it may not be grabbing the headlines, it is potentially one of the most impactful parts of the announcement.The Highway Code matters because it shapes the culture on our roads, from how road users treat each other, to how we police road users.Three of the most important proposals, which follow a review announced in 2018, are: As Cycling UK explains, a hierarchy of road users would work as follows: “Pedestrians, in particular children, older adults and disabled people, followed by cyclists, horse riders and motorcyclists. It wouldn’t remove the need for all users to behave responsibly or give priority to pedestrians and cyclists in every situation, but it would ensure that their needs were considered first.”Campaigners would prefer it to be called a “hierarchy of responsibility”, rather than risking the suggestion that some road users are more important than others, but it is good news nonetheless.Until now, there was nothing explicit in the Highway Code saying motorists or motorcyclists should not left hook, or turn across a cyclist’s path at a junction. The changes suggest just that, putting cyclists’ rights at junctions on a par with those driving.Proposed overtaking rules include that drivers should give cyclists 1.5-metre space if driving under 30mph and at least 2 metres if driving over 30mph, with larger vehicles required to give 2 metres at all times. Cyclists are explicitly permitted to filter through traffic, either on the right or left of slow-moving or stationary vehicles.There could be new “Dutch reach” rules to encourage motorists to look before opening car doors into the path of cyclists, which can be fatal.Cyclists would also explicitly be able to ride two abreast or more, and would no longer be advised to ride single file in some circumstances unless they felt safe doing so. As anyone who has ridden in a group knows, it is often far safer for everyone – including drivers – for riders to position themselves two abreast as it reduces the time a passing driver needs to move into the opposite traffic lane. Cyclists are explicitly advised to ride in the centre of a traffic lane to make themselves as visible as possible, unless it is safe to move over.“This is quite important,” says Cycling UK’s Duncan Dollimore, “because there are some roads police who believe you should ride 50cm from the gutter, and that you shouldn’t be riding two abreast on a country road.”Dollimore says the proposals would go a long way to making roads safer. “We all want separated cycle lanes and those announced are hugely important but at the moment we haven’t got the money that will enable that to be a complete network. They won’t be built overnight so there’s still a requirement to address driver behaviour, even if we do get a complete network in the future.”He adds: “People’s behaviour isn’t going to change the next day, but this is relevant to my son who is learning to drive, because that is the Highway Code they will be asked to look at.”Ultimately, we will see what comes out of the consultation, and from the spending review, to back up these grand proposals. According to the Cycling and Walking Alliance, and to the government’s own analysis, £6bn-£8bn is needed over the next five years to double cycling levels – well above the £2bn committed by the government so far. However, this is being hailed as a real step change in its ambition for active travel and it appears Boris Johnson and his team believe in the proposals.We know cycling and walking can help solve almost every major problem we face, from obesity to air pollution, congestion, injuries and deaths on the road. Thanks to a global pandemic, their true value has been highlighted, and our government must seize this opportunity to improve our roads."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c54a2118256d158e747e881be311e7135c8447a/0_319_1483_890/master/1483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=646cb959d36a39b515ea39db5ea1c31e","title":"caught in the act camera traps snare rarest species in pictures","story":"Snow leopards, tapirs, oriental storks and many others feature in WWF’s new collection.

And so is summer’s biggest style challenge – how to stay safe without looking like Cousin IttI have spent the past 10 minutes trying to work out how to phrase this sensitively, but I’m just going to come right out with it: sunglasses with a face mask is a challenging combination to pull off. It just looks a bit odd.Even though no one disagrees, this is a controversial topic nonetheless. Any discussion of the aesthetics of mask wearing is problematic, because the minute you start talking about style in this context it sounds as if you are weighing up whether it’s more important to (a) keep yourself and others safe or (b) look cool.That’s not a thing. As long as we need to wear the masks, we wear the masks. But that doesn’t mean that we’re not allowed to talk about how to navigate this look. Face masks are, after all, the most radical shift in the optics of the world around us in decades. You would have to go back to the trend for long hair on men half a century ago to find anything as profoundly unignorable. We can’t just pretend masks aren’t there, when they are, literally, in your face. The same principle applies as when talking to someone who has spinach in their teeth. Awkward, but best to tackle the issue.I feel like we are getting to grips with basic mask-wearing, just about – but now we face a fresh challenge. With a heatwave incoming, it is time to grapple with this summer’s most challenging high-summer look. One that makes last year’s headline-grabbing cycling shorts trend seem like a walk in the park by comparison. How to wear sunglasses with a face mask?When Billie Eilish wore shades and a Gucci face mask to the Grammys back in January, it seemed like a pop star red-carpet stunt of the Rihanna-wears-an-omelette-to-the-Met-Gala variety. But – well, here we are, in the stranger-than-fiction summer of 2020. The combination of sunglasses and a face mask obliterates most of your face. Face coverings have long been common in many cultures, but for those of us not used to them, they impact dramatically on recognition and communication.I was about to step into the post office on Saturday when a woman in front of me stopped in her tracks on the pavement, blocking the entrance, distracted by something on her phone. I couldn’t hustle past her, as would have been perfectly normal urban behaviour pre-social distancing. It was fine, I wasn’t in a hurry I just waited. When she noticed me she looked stricken and apologised profusely – and I realised too late that my non-verbal signals of harmony and fellowship weren’t working because I had on a mask and shades. I had given her a we’ve-all-been-there-no-drama smile, but she wasn’t to know. As far as she was concerned, I might have been glaring at her. It made me feel sad.It may not be possible to look friendly in a mask and sunglasses, but there are ways to look less mean. The most important part is to show some skin. We think of showing flesh as being a sex thing, but it’s not always about that. It has a basic humanising effect (this is why politicians love to roll their sleeves up in photo opportunities). The actor Kerry Washington’s Instagram selfies usually feature a soft, curly fringe, but when she teams black Fenty shades with a leopard-print mask, she scrapes her hair back from her face. An updo that bares your neck and temples is good for avoiding Cousin Itt vibes, here.Smaller sunglasses that cover less surface area work better than the old-school Hollywood bug-eyed ones. (Also the cute whimsy of a cat’s-eye shape is better, mood-music wise, than the angular Neo-from-Matrix style. Enough dystopia, already.) If you want to go 70s rather than 50s, take a cue from Rose Byrne as Gloria Steinem in Mrs America, and find some pale aviators, tinted rather than opaque, so that you can see your eyes. Joe Biden, who has been wearing Ray-Ban silver-frame aviators for decades, has a head start in this particular race.New York – where masks have been mandatory in public since April, and it has been sunglasses weather for much of that time – is the place to look for mask-and-shades street style. In June, Katie Holmes had already caught on to the advantages of a cat’s-eye shape, wearing dainty shades that curved upwards to show some cheekbone above the mask and pulling her hair into a high bun, to expose the skin at her neck and temples. Sarah Jessica Parker teams her dark glasses with a sunny, sky-blue bandana tied as a mask, and manages to exude rakish glamour.My impulse-bought gingham and animal print masks languish unworn, because I have worked out that I feel least self-conscious in the plain-black kind. So I have put away my trusty black Wayfarers and dug out gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses and a tortoiseshell cat’s-eye style. Matching the colour of your mask to your sunglasses blanks out your face in a slightly spooky way, so I’ll leave the black shades to those of you in paler or brighter masks, this summer. Also, I’d probably advise against going for both a wacky, brightly coloured mask and zany sunglasses. I know that fashion is supposed to reflect the world we live in, but when the world we live in is this strange, I feel like it’s not quite necessary.There is another reason, besides the simple mummification of our faces, that a mask and sunglasses reads as a strange combination. A mask tells us something is wrong (you don’t say). Sunglasses, on the other hand, signal warm carefree days – and so, they make an oddly mismatched pair. But look on the bright side. Yes, we need to wear masks. But hey – it’s summer. And, as sunglasses remind us, sunny days will come again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c4e698932c10c36e3ef438383bb1046701f1589/0_322_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d049c68d64982d3ff7a1ecfd81767a4b","title":"how to use up leftover treacle molasses and syrup","story":"Inspired ways to use up leftover treacle, molasses and syrupI find myself buying molasses, syrup and treacle for specific things, only to be left with half-empty bottles of sticky things. What can I do with them?Lily, Greenford, MiddlesexItamar Srulovich, one half of the couple behind Honey \u0026amp Co, is the master of squeaky-clean molasses receptacles. “We have a fatwa on half-used bottles,” he says. “Everything that can be done, we’ve done.” This shouldn’t be at all surprising, considering how versatile fruit molasses – date, grape, pomegranate – is.Even the dregs are good news. Srulovich pours boiling water into near-empty bottles, shakes then pours the contents over a roast chicken 10 minutes before it’s done. “It caramelises and becomes a sticky, sweet-and-sour glaze,” he says. “I can’t even tell you how good that is.” Alternatively, Ghayour mixes the molasses into cocktails – gin, vodka or “your favourite mixer” – treating it as you would lemon.Where there are drinks, there should be snacks, and Ghayour bathes nuts in molasses and spices, toasting until dried out. Or, add a splash of maple syrup instead (plus a handful of seeds). This liquid gold is not just for drizzling, mind: it can add depth to barbecue sauce, roasted veg and vinaigrette, too.I would wager many are in a sticky situation with treacle. Its most high-profile relationship is, of course, with ginger (ginger snaps, gingerbread, cake), and for good reason. Benjamina Ebuehi, author of The New Way to Cake, melts molasses and golden syrup with butter, stem ginger and vanilla before adding the rest of her ingredients. Her choice of icing? Caramelised white chocolate, which, she writes, “transforms it into something with much more depth. Think of a really creamy dulce de leche, and you’re not far off.”Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Percy Pig is a hugely successful brand of sweets, sold by Marks \u0026amp Spencer.He turned vegetarian last year and underwent a cut in sugar. But like so many other brands of sweets, say obesity campaigners, the hype hides the truth that too many Percys will make you fat (and rot your teeth).“Made with real fruit juice,” say the Percy Pig packets. “No artificial colours or flavourings.” They may look like the answer to a parent or grandparent’s prayers – sweets with little harm.But the first three and therefore largest items on the list of ingredients are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose syrup. Next comes fruit juice from concentrates, which contains sugar, however natural it may be. And to round it all off, the last item is inverse sugar syrup, which is another mixture of glucose and fructose, made by heating table sugar with water.“I just think that is not right. I think that is genuinely misleading,” said the restaurateur Henry Dimbleby at the launch of his National Food Strategy. He admits he has had “a bugbear about Percy Pigs” for a while (though the report also singles out Innocent’s lemon and lime-flavoured Juicy Water for saying “no added sugar” but omitting to mention the eight teaspoons-worth of natural sugars from grapes and pears).The strategy report says: “One of the most egregious sins of the modern food industry is its habit of clothing itself, and its products, in false virtue … ‘No artificial colours or artificial flavourings’ trills the packaging for Percy Pig, the ‘soft gums made with fruit juice’… How many parents take the time to check the ingredients list? If they did, they might (assuming they know how ingredient lists work) be agog to find that the three largest ingredients by weight are glucose syrup, sugar and glucose-fructose-syrup.“I single out Marks \u0026amp Spencer here, not because it is the biggest sinner, but because it is such a well-trusted company. A British institution, M\u0026ampS has the pledge ‘we always strive to do the right thing’ as one of its guiding principles. If M\u0026ampS – which is a great deal more scrupulous than many food companies – is guilty of such trickery, you can be sure the practice is ubiquitous.“Food packaging is increasingly littered with boasts that, if not quite lies, are at least wilfully misleading. ‘Low fat’ often means high starch, but it never says so. The words ‘free from’ and ‘less’ are sprinkled around without context. ‘Free from’ refined sugar, but rigid with fruit sugars? Nutritional values – calories, salt, sugar etc – are given ‘per portion’, even when a portion bears no resemblance to the quantity on offer.”An M\u0026ampS spokesperson said: “All our products have clear labelling so that customers can make informed choices about what they buy. All our Percy Pigs are made with natural fruit juices and no artificial colours or flavourings and last year we also introduced a range of Percy Pigs with one third less sugar.”No sweets can ever be healthy. The clue is in the name – they are sweet because of sugar. Fruit is very healthy, but only if you eat the whole orange and don’t squeeze six of them for the juice and throw away the fibre. Natural sugars are not magically good for you because they come from nature. So does sugar cane. Sugars make a lot of our food taste better, but the key is to have a little as an occasional, not habitual, treat – not to consume a bag of Percy Pigs because they sound healthy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4245b923780b62139a96e233a4e2c010d959f690/64_164_3140_1884/master/3140.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=68b6e1f35faa3fff7d008096d608b2bd","title":"uefa claim against manchester city over sponsor money time barred cas rules","story":"The findings that led to Uefa’s club financial control body (CFCB) deciding that Manchester City were guilty of a “serious breach” of financial fair play regulations and imposing a two year Champions League ban have finally been revealed in the judgment of the court of arbitration for sport, which overturned the CFCB’s decisions.The CFCB found after its investigations and hearings that the Abu Dhabi United Group (ADUG), the company through which Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family owns City, had funded payments in 2012 and 2013, understood to be £15m each year, that were reported to the Football Association and to Uefa as independent sponsorships from the telecoms company Etisalat.The Cas panel of three European lawyers decided by a majority 2-1, however, that it would not consider the legitimacy of those Etisalat payments, because they were made more than five years before the CFCB charges were brought in May 2019, so were “time-barred”.Uefa’s rules for the CFCB, whose members are appointed to oversee compliance with FFP, state that “prosecution is barred after five years” for all breaches of FFP regulations.The senior European lawyers in the CFCB’s adjudicatory chamber (AC), and experienced academics, former politicians and executives in the investigative chamber (IC), considered May 2014 as the date of City’s breach. That was when City agreed an FFP settlement with Uefa, based on the club’s reporting of its finances, which included that Etisalat, a Middle East telecoms giant headquartered in Abu Dhabi, had paid the sponsorship itself.In public statements throughout the process, City had accused the members of the IC, AC and Uefa itself of bias against the club, claiming they ignored “irrefutable evidence”. The Cas judgment makes no suggestion of bias, and states that “Uefa by no means filed frivolous charges against MCFC. As also acknowledged by MCFC, there was a legitimate basis to prosecute MCFC.”The Cas judgment also contains the extraordinary revelation that the panel’s chairman, Rui Botica Santos, a Portuguese lawyer, was recommended by City. Cas rules for appeals state that each party chooses one arbitrator, then the chairman is selected by the chairman of Cas’s own appeals arbitration ision. No explanation has yet been given for why City suggested the chairman for this case, although the judgment notes that Uefa did not object.Some European sports lawyers, speaking to the , have questioned the independence of the panel member nominated by City, Andrew McDougall QC, a partner in the international law firm White and Case. McDougall was chair of his firm’s operations council for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from 2016-2018, which includes an office in Abu Dhabi. That office lists Etisalat as a client, and the Abu Dhabi airline Etihad, whose sponsorships were also central to the case, as well as several Abu Dhabi state enterprises.City’s position is understood to be that McDougall himself has not acted for those Abu Dhabi companies although his firm has, and that the club’s hierarchy recommended him because of his strong reputation as a lawyer. Uefa did not respond to a question about whether it raised any objection to McDougall’s appointment. McDougall declined to respond to questions from the  about whether he had an apparent conflict of interest in sitting on the case.Uefa’s nominee was Ulrich Haas, a German law professor based in Zurich, a long-term arbitrator on Cas panels.The Etisalat evidence, as well as the more widely reported allegations relating to City’s Etihad sponsorship, was a principal reason underpinning the AC’s findings that City were guilty of a breach serious enough to warrant a two-year ban and €30m fine. The FFP rules, introduced by Uefa in 2010-11 to encourage responsible financial management by clubs, limits the cash owners can pour in, which makes independent sponsorships more important for boosting revenues. Like all relationships between clubs and sports governing bodies, the system relies on trust and honest reporting.The allegations relating to Etihad’s sponsorship were based on City’s own internal emails, published as “leaks” by the German magazine Der Spiegel in November 2018, prompting the IC to ask City for an explanation. The emails included three from City’s then chief financial officer, Jorge Chumillas, to Simon Pearce, a senior City executive, setting out that in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2015-16, direct funding from Etihad was only £8m, with ADUG funding the rest, which was £59.5m in 2015-16. One email to Pearce enclosed invoices for the sponsorships, with only £8m charged to Etihad.Citywere found to have obstructed and failed to cooperate with the CFCB’s investigations, but they gave the Cas panel more cooperation, with executives including Pearce providing evidence and appearing as witnesses, insisting that Etihad funded the whole sponsorship. Sheikh Mansour himself also provided a letter, stating: “I have not authorised ADUG to make any payments to Etihad, Etisalat or any of their affiliates in relation to their sponsorship of MCFC.” On the basis of the further evidence it considered, the Cas panel found the Etihad charge to be “not established”.The judgment reveals that on 9 March this year, nine other Premier League clubs wrote to Cas opposing any attempt by City to seek a “stay of execution” allowing them to play in Europe next season if the appeal hearing was delayed. The clubs were Arsenal, Burnley, Chelsea, Leicester, Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle, Tottenham and Wolves. But three weeks later City told Cas it had not requested a stay of execution. Cas agreed with City that the clubs’ claim was therefore “moot”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8092c4a8c11e569b56c47a35a9be7c4f69003e7e/0_171_2016_1208/master/2016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7117c90ea62f5c0a9104a1a25da39731","title":"forgotten stories the 1985 english super cup podcast","story":"The best stories from the beautiful game that you may never have heard before, written by some of the world’s leading sports journalists, and ning more than 100 years of sporting history from across the footballing planet.

With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

Stars including Pharrell Williams, Elton John and Bruce Springsteen have all made their displeasure known while most recently Neil Young has said he is reconsidering legal action after Rockin’ in the Free World continues to be played at rallies.Other signatories of the letter include Sia, Alanis Morissette, Lionel Richie, Elvis Costello, Regina Spektor, Sheryl Crow and Steven Tyler.

This is simply not true, the evidence does not exist.“If these US-style voter suppression plans go ahead, we could see BAME communities locked out of democracy. The government must correct the record and recognise the damaging impact that mandatory voter ID will have upon minority ethnic groups.”In a series of Freedom of Information requests by the Labour party, the government has also said it does not hold data on the possession of ID by ethnicity.Voting rights groups expressed serious concern at the findings. Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said ministers had “apparently failed to gather any evidence” and said it was “baffling and looks deeply misleading”. He said the ERS research suggested the policy will disproportionately hit people of colour, older voters and those on low-incomes.Sam Grant, policy and campaigns manager at Liberty, said: “The fact the government doesn’t have the evidence to understand what impact this will have shows it is disregarding these risks and trying to plough ahead with plans that threaten the basic foundations of our democratic system.”In a statement, Smith said voter ID was “a reasonable way to combat the inexcusable potential for voter fraud in our current system and strengthen its integrity”. Smith added that there was a “wealth of evidence to show that voter ID does not impact voter turnout” including its operation in Northern Ireland for several decades and said the studies had shown the overwhelming majority of people cast their vote successfully in the pilot schemes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05808bc124ab21f85528dfece236d611daef437f/121_0_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8cc95ca797efe95398238f11d10c8ef","title":"virgin galactic offers peek inside new space plane for tourists","story":"Inside of VSS Unity unveiled, showing the cabin in which six passengers will be able to float in zero gravity on the edge of spaceVirgin Galactic has revealed the interior of its centrepiece space plane, showing off a cabin with new custom seats and a “space mirror” in a virtual tour of what its passengers can expect to experience on flights to the edge of space.For $250,000 a ticket, passengers who have signed up for the suborbital flight aboard the air-launched plane VSS Unity will strap into six tailored seats and be able to peer out of the cabin’s 12 circular windows as they ascend 97km (60 miles) above Earth. The plane has five other windows.Virgin Galactic chief space officer George Whitesides said passengers could unbuckle themselves at peak altitude to float around the cabin in zero-gravity conditions.The company has 600 customers signed up to fly and at least 400 more who have expressed interest, Whitesides said. No date has been set for its first commercial space flight. British founder Sir Richard Branson is expected to be aboard.Virgin Galactic has never made a profit and has been plagued by successive delays. Branson said last year he hoped to make the first trip “in months, not years” after securing £60m of deposits.The cabin also features a large, circular mirror in the back “to allow our customers to see themselves in space in a way that has really never been done before,” Whitesides said.The plane, attached to a bigger carrier plane, is intended to take off from the company’s New Mexico spaceport and detach mid-air to launch further toward the edge of space in a trip lasting 90 minutes.Virgin Galactic is vying for space tourism supremacy with the SpaceX project launched by the Tesla founder, Elon Musk, and the Blue Origin venture headed by Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest person.Branson floated the business on the stock market in October, securing $450m of funding through a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia, an investment vehicle run by the former Facebook executive Chamath Palihapitiya.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/316d87624f1e4f058a8a71952d021fef1bc92098/0_1044_3602_2161/master/3602.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc38f7b2bfcee3a8d3f446499e79cc54","title":"the coolidge effect review wonder fools","story":"Available onlineJack Nurse and Robbie Gordon debate the problems and prudishness surrounding pornography in a lively audio play adapted from the stageStories to Connect Us is the name given by the Glasgow company Wonder Fools to its online season – and with good reason. In our months of lockdown, connection is exactly what we’ve missed. It is ironic, then, that The Coolidge Effect, the second show in the season, should be about disconnection. Its theme is internet pornography, something that could have been purpose built for a time of social isolation.Playwrights Jack Nurse and Robbie Gordon point out that porn sites attract more visitors than Netflix, Amazon and Twitter combined. Yet if porn is talked about at all, it is in furtive tones. You could call it a secret pandemic.Given a polished audio makeover in its transfer from the stage, The Coolidge Effect takes its name from a 1955 experiment by Frank A Beach. He theorised that sexual arousal is governed not by the act of sex itself, but by variety of sexual experience. The sexual appetite of a male rat given a new female partner every day never diminished.In its lively mixture of lecture, storytelling and interviews, the play suggests the similar variety of sexual experience available online has produced an insatiable demand. Next comes addiction and sexual dysfunction. That’s especially problematic for a generation of young men who graduate directly from their Game Boys to Pornhub.It’s not all prudish alarm, however. Performed by Gordon and Jamie Marie Leary against a backdrop of eerie electronic soundscapes by VanIves, the play finds room for porn justifications ranging from the feminist to the sociological. It is less concerned with moralising than with the need for debate. “A history of silence,” it warns, “never did us any good.”"},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Last year it drafted D’Arcy Carden in to present the nominations, after her incredible multi-part turn as Janet in The Good Place, only to snub her senseless in full view of the world. This year, a portion of the nominations were announced by Laverne Cox. Turns out she actually was nominated for an Emmy, but host Leslie Jones couldn’t remember her category or the name of her show (guest actress, Orange is the New Black), instead choosing to shout “YOU WERE NOMINATED!” over and over again while Cox visibly struggled to see her way clear of the chaos.It was a mess, but at least it kept things interesting. And thank heavens that something did, because as far as the nominations are concerned, the Emmys are absolutely business as usual. There were nods for The Kominsky Method and The Marvelous Mrs Maisel – two shows that I could swear are watched by nobody but Emmy voters – and more for a markedly off-the-boil season of Killing Eve. Once again, you sense that everyone hedged their bets with safe choices.That said, if I were Reese Witherspoon, I would be hopping mad today. Few actors have made the transition from film to TV like Witherspoon, who consistently demonstrates incredible taste when it comes to picking projects. This year alone, she has been front and centre in three of them HBO’s Big Little Lies, Hulu’s Little Fires Everywhere and Apple’s The Morning Show. In each of them she played big, meaty, complex roles that any other actor would kill for. And yet she came up completely short on Tuesday. Laura Dern and Meryl Streep got nominated for Big Little Lies. Kerry Washington got nominated for Little Fires Everywhere. Jennifer Aniston, Billy Crudup, Steve Carell, Mark Duplass and Martin Short – of all people – all got nominated for The Morning Show. But nothing for Witherspoon. It almost feels deliberate.Similarly overt was the disappearance of Bob Odenkirk from the best drama actor category, since perennial nominee Better Call Saul just completed the greatest season of its entire run, and Odenkirk’s increasingly deranged performance propelled much of that. Rhea Seehorn wasn’t nominated either, although her absence felt thuddingly familiar. I maintain that the comprehensive snubbing of Rhea Seehorn will be seen as an extraordinary oversight in years to come. Seehorn has, to my mind, consistently delivered the single most compelling performance on television since Better Call Saul began. If there was any fairness in the world, she would be a multiple Emmy winner by now. The fact that she has never so much as been nominated is as extraordinary as it is shameful.Compared with this comprehensive freezing out, the other snubs feel relatively minor. Thomas Middleditch probably deserved something for his performance in Silicon Valley. Pamela Adlon and Better Things were conspicuous by their absence. Betty Gilpin was the sole – if deserved – representative of Glow, and it turns out the Emmys weren’t nearly as enthralled with Normal People as any of you sex-starved lockdown millennials were in the spring (only Paul Mescal squeaked in). Elisabeth Moss didn’t get nominated for The Handmaid’s Tale, and nor did anyone from Homeland, arguably because both shows lost their momentum a long time ago. Russell Crowe didn’t get nominated for the Loudest Voice, arguably because Bombshell stole its thunder. Pose, The Plot Against America and Unbelievable also failed to score the hauls expected of them.There were also a few surprise inclusions. Happily, Zendaya’s bold role in Euphoria was rewarded with a nomination, and What We Do in the Shadows received a brilliantly unexpected nod in the best comedy category. There is a chance, albeit an outside one, that The Mandalorian will win best drama come September. It’s an incredibly long shot, because it’ll have to barge past the colossus that is Succession, but the fact that something as slight could be nominated at all should raise a few eyebrows. And Westworld barely got a look in too. Usually I’d call that a snub, but Westworld has been terrible lately, so mainly I’m surprised that the Emmys got something right.Still, at least D’Arcy Carden finally got her nomination this year. There is a god, after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c4fa3f850f3588de95ade793c91f3b02044c70/71_161_3429_2057/master/3429.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c067ce70201748f29448aa0486dbc417","title":"john lewis capitol casket outside in state","story":"Kept outdoors by coronavirus threat, hundreds view casket of congressman and civil rights iconBorn in Citronelle, Alabama, in the early 1950s, Frankie Blevins grew up with the cruelties imposed by the Jim Crow south: racially segregated drinking fountains, restrooms and restaurants.On her family’s first road trip, her mother packed food to sustain them for the entire trip, knowing they would not be allowed to stop for provisions along the way.And on 7 March 1965, Blevins vividly recalls watching news coverage of a young John Lewis walking alongside those leading civil rights marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, into a phalanx of white state troopers wielding clubs and bullwhips, on a day that would become known as Bloody Sunday.Standing outside the US Capitol building Tuesday, where Lewis now lies in state following his death this month, Blevins told the : “My life today is so much more livable in this nation because of what he and others did.” She had watched on TV all those decades ago, when, ordered to disperse from the bridge, the protesters refused and the troopers advanced, weapons raised in a hail of teargas. Lewis, in the vanguard, had his skull fractured by a trooper’s blow.Eight days later, President Lyndon Johnson introduced the Voting Rights Act, the landmark civil rights legislation. He signed it into law on 6 August.After learning of Lewis’s death, Blevins decided to fly to Washington from Charleston, South Carolina, where she lives, to see him welcomed into what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi described as the “pantheon of patriots.” She wiped her eyes as she looked toward the congressman’s casket, raised on the same catafalque where Abraham Lincoln once rested, she said: “I could not let this moment go by without being there.”She was among thousands of members of the public who came to the Capitol on Tuesday to pay tribute to the son of sharecroppers who would be remembered as a civil rights icon and the “conscience of Congress”.Traditionally, visitors would be welcomed into the Capitol to bid farewell. But the public has been prevented from entering buildings in the complex since March, because of the coronavirus.Instead, Lewis’s coffin was placed outside the Capitol, atop the center steps that lead to the domed rotunda, on Monday evening and all day Tuesday. Above his casket, an American flag flew at half-staff.Lewis, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in December, died on 17 July, at the age of 80. He is only the second black lawmaker to lie in state in the Capitol, and the first to lie in state in the rotunda.All those who came to pay their respects on Tuesday wore masks, as required. Some face coverings carried messages: “Black Lives Matter” or “Good Trouble” – one of Lewis’s favorite expressions, which encouraged people to stand up to discrimination and injustice. Social distancing was enforced between visitors as they wended their way to the base of the Capitol steps.The Lewis family requested the public offer tributes online using the dedicated hashtags #BelovedCommunity or #HumanDignity, rather than risk their health traveling from out of town. But those who came said they felt compelled.“As African Americans, I believe he was one of our forefathers,” said Tasha Burks, who came with her son from Virginia. “He led that march for us to have the freedoms that we have now. He walked the walk and talked the talk. Someone like that you have to come out and pay your respects in person.”More than half a century after Lewis was beaten by a mob as a Freedom Rider, defying segregation of interstate bus services, and marched in Selma, young people are again marching in the streets.Lewis encouraged the Black Lives Matter movement, whose supporters demand racial equality in nationwide protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer in May. Those who came pondered the progress that had been made since then – and how best to honor his legacy.“I’m encouraging people to keep marching and to continue to be hopeful,” said Alysia Dempsey, an author based in Washington. She then pointed to her shirt, which read: “The best way to protest is to vote.”The viewing was part of a processional of public remembrances that started in Alabama and will end this week in Georgia, the state Lewis represented in Congress.On Sunday, a horse-drawn carriage carried his flag-draped casket over the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Red rose petals blanketed the four-lane stretch of road suspended above the Alabama River, where Lewis once bled.The casket was placed in the Capitol rotunda on Monday as political leaders of both parties paid their respects, though without Donald Trump, who declined to attend.On Tuesday, despite high summer heat, a steady stream of visitors placed their hands on their hearts or bowed their heads as they paused at the foot of the Capitol.Some had personal recollections of the congressman,his unwavering courage and his relentless optimism, his quiet presence and his thundering oratory.Rocky Twyman, who is leading a campaign to nominate Lewis for a Nobel peace prize, said he had marched alongside him in Atlanta in the 1960s. Twyman recalled Lewis as a mentor to the next generation of civil rights organizers. He said he hoped Lewis’s legacy of non-violent opposition would continue to shape the movement for racial equality.“He never fought back. He never yielded to it,” said Twyman, who wore a tie-dyed T-shirt with the words “Black Lives Matter”. “He was a towering figure, a civil rights icon, but he was always willing to talk to the young people. That’s what I loved about him.”Two onlookers held signs urging Congress to honor Lewis’s legacy by passing legislation that would restore a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, which was renamed in the late congressman’s honor this week.The marquee sign outside of the United Methodist Building, across the street from the Capitol, said: “In memory of Rep John Lewis. Hope. Act. Vote.”Some knew Lewis only from history books and movies but were moved all the same. “My heart is heavy right now because what happened to him in the 50s and 60s is happening right now, today,” said Kelly Pete, a lifelong resident of DC. “It’s like history is repeating itself.”Pete, who is black, believed Donald Trump had exacerbated these problems, accusing him of fomenting hate and inflaming racial tensions.Though she worried about the world that her grandchildren will grow up in, Pete remained hopeful, as Lewis preached.“They won’t win,” she said of the forces opposed to racial equality. “God don’t like ugly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/692ae140fee4ff039da0c577f384f214f1d7bc6b/0_0_2939_1763/master/2939.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=bb1b5b29d908edfba74a2dde2f54e38d","title":"global report downsized hajj pilgrimage begins amid covid 19 restrictions","story":"US deaths near 150,000 half of people living in Mumbai slums have had the coronavirus China records 100 new casesMuslim pilgrims have begun the annual hajj in the holy city of Mecca in a dramatically downsized version as the hosts, Saudi Arabia, try to prevent any outbreaks of coronavirus during the five-day pilgrimage.The hajj, one of the five pillars or most important practices of Islam and an obligation for able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime, is usually one of the world’s largest religious gatherings as around 2.5 million people descend on the city from all over the world.But this year attendance is being limited to 10,000 people already residing in the kingdom as the authorities seek to control Covid-19. The disease has already infected more than 270,000 people in Saudi Arabia, placing it in the top 20 worst-affected countries.Pilgrims will be required to wear masks and observe social distancing during a series of religious rites that are completed over five days in Mecca and its surroundings in western Saudi Arabia.Those selected to take part in the hajj were subject to temperature checks and placed in quarantine as they began trickling into Mecca at the weekend.State media showed health workers sanitising their luggage, and some pilgrims reported being given electronic wristbands to allow authorities to monitor their whereabouts.There have now been 16.67 million cases of coronavirus around the world and more than 659,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The US has the world’s most serious outbreak, with almost 150,000 deaths and 4.3 million cases.The US president, Donald Trump, halted his daily White House briefing abruptly on Tuesday night after being questioned about why he described as “spectacular” a doctor who wrongly dismissed the use of face masks to combat the coronavirus. The doctor also reportedly claimed that alien DNA is used in medical treatments and some gynaecological problems are caused by people dreaming about having sex with demons.Florida, the third most populous state in the US, has reported another record one-day rise in coronavirus deaths. The state health department said 191 people died from the disease in the 24 hours to Tuesday evening.Cases in Texas passed the 400,000 mark, fuelling fears that the United States is still not taking control of the outbreak and adding pressure on Congress to pass another massive economic aid package.China reported 101 new coronavirus cases in the mainland for 28 July, the highest in over three and a half months, the health commission said on Wednesday. China has moved quickly to stem outbreaks by contact tracing and reimposing restrictions in affected areas. Recently many of the new infections are reported to have come from the far western region of Xinjiang, where 89 have been tallied for 28 July. One was recorded in Beijing, while three were imported cases, according to a statement by the National Health Commission.In Australia, the state of Victoria recorded 295 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, down 89 from Tuesday’s figure of 384, which in turn was 150 fewer than were recorded in the record high numbers on Monday. Nine more people have died, which is close to the national record 10 deaths reported in the state one day last week. There were 19 new cases in New South Wales state, prompting neighbouring Queensland to close its border to anyone from Sydney.New Zealand recorded two new cases of Covid-19, both diagnosed in returning travellers to the country who are quarantined in managed isolation facilities. That is the case for all of New Zealand’s 23 active cases of the coronavirus – there is no known community transmission.

What we all need to get our heads around is this is a new virus and this one is behaving differently,” Harris told a virtual briefing in Geneva, urging vigilance in applying measures to slow transmission that appears to be accelerated by mass gatherings.She also warned against thinking in terms of virus waves, saying: “It’s going to be one big wave. It’s going to go up and down a bit. The best thing is to flatten it and turn it into just something lapping at your feet.”The reality is that the issue of second waves has been a contentious one, much talked about by politicians – including Boris Johnson – and the media, but often very ill-defined.With no agreed-upon scientific definition, the term “second wave” has been used to mean anything from localised spikes in infection to full-blown national crises, leading some experts to avoid it.Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control, is among those arguing that the concept is unhelpful for “implying that Covid-19 will act as the flu acts”.Complicating the issue is perspective. Seen from a global viewpoint – such as that of the WHO – the pandemic appears as a single, large and still-accelerating outbreak, with worldwide numbers doubling in the past six weeks.In terms of regional spread and even within inidual countries, from a ground-level view, it becomes more complicated.What can appear like a second wave is sometimes different areas of the same country simply being out of phase with each other in experiencing the epidemic, as in the US where a strong but uneven first wave moved initially in fits and starts and then more quickly.Keith Neal, emeritus professor in the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said that it has become a “media term”, as well as a scientific one.As Melissa Hawkins, a professor of health at American University, wrote in the Conversation, looking at the US situation, talking about second waves in countries where the disease has simply progressed unevenly is inappropriate.“The US as a whole is not in a second wave because the first wave never really stopped. The virus is simply spreading into new populations or resurging in places that let down their guard too soon,” she wrote, a comment applicable to other countries that have seen resurgences.As the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, which examined 10 epidemics of respiratory disease from 1889, points out: “Most of our thinking on second-wave theory arises from the 1918-20 Spanish flu that infected 500 million people worldwide and reportedly killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million.”“‘Waves’ imply a lack of viral circulation which is probably an illusion,” wrote Tom Jefferson and Carl Heneghan early in the outbreak in the UK.“Waves are also visible and mostly rhythmical. There does not appear to be any pattern or rhythm to the epidemics summarised in the table and their comings and going are only visible because of the effects on the human body and their impact on society.”The disease has little respect for land borders, even when authorities have tried to seal them perhaps the only country that appears to have entirely stamped out the disease is New Zealand, an island nation that has curtailed almost all inbound travel.More important than the description of any rise in cases is public health management of the increase, Neal added, and he cautioned that identifying a true second wave may need the perspective of time.“The WHO is looking at world figures and these are still increasing so as a pandemic we are in the first wave.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9261d312f0a39fa07481f3b03d53ac314b97b0c0/0_175_5377_3227/master/5377.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=870c9e21776fbf83ac40b45ba2978d3d","title":"wednesday briefing plea for more free school meals in food policy overhaul","story":"Dimbleby report says Covid-19 aftermath will worsen food insecurity … police grapple with rise in angry protest … and why leaves on the line delay trainsHello, I’m Warren Murray, and should this day find you confined, here is as much of the wider world as we can bring you in a few minutes.Up to 1.5 million more children in England should get free school meals to help tackle food poverty and unhealthy eating, according to a government-commissioned report billed as the first national food strategy since wartime rationing. It warns the climate crisis will be the source of the next food emergency demands more than £2bn for farmers to improve the countryside and condemns faux-healthy food labelling by big brands – including the idea of “healthy” Marks \u0026amp Spencer Percy Pig sweets.The author of the strategy, the Leon restaurant co-founder Henry Dimbleby, said Covid-19 had highlighted stark economic, health and nutritional inequalities which are set to be made worse by the pandemic’s economic fallout. Dimbleby is scathing of brands and supermarkets that mislabel sugar-filled products as healthy sweets. He warned “the wave of unemployment now rushing towards us is likely to create a sharp rise in food insecurity and outright hunger”. The report comes 48 hours after the launch of a government anti-obesity strategy that was criticised for putting responsibility on the shoulders of iniduals instead of tackling structural inequalities. Dimbleby is to publish a second part of the food strategy in 2021, looking more closely at climate change issues and bioscience. The government has pledged to respond with a white paper six months after that.No ‘second wave’ – The Covid-19 pandemic is unfolding as “one big wave” that rises and falls, the WHO says, with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza, or the coronaviruses that cause a harmless cold. The issue of a second wave has been a contentious one, much talked about by politicians including Boris Johnson, and the media, but the WHO’s Margaret Harris and other experts say the concept is unhelpful.

Photograph: iStock A majority of Irish children feel their learning was negatively impacted by homeschooling during the pandemic, with learning out of the classroom also negatively impacting the mental health of some second-level students, data from an unpublished study shows.The data was gathered by academics from NUI Galway working with the National Parents Council, and takes in the views of more than 1,000 primary and secondary school-aged children around the country.It comes as teacher unions warned that some schools may have to reopen on a staggered basis due to expected difficulties in preparing for a return of students in late August.Some 52 per cent of primary schoolchildren said they learned less at home than in school, while 71.8 per cent of post-primary students said they learned a lot or a little less. The secondary school students also reported that their interest in schooling at home had dwindled over the period, with 65.3 per cent saying it had decreased a little or a lot.Mental healthSome 14.6 per cent of secondary students said it had a very negative effect on their mental health. Another 29.6 per cent said it had either quite a negative effect or a slightly negative effect. This compares with 17.2 per cent who said it had a positive effect, to some degree.The preliminary data from the survey were shared in a draft report with the Oireachtas Special Committee on the Covid-19 Response. Among second-level students, only 4.4 per cent said they were “really not looking forward to returning to school”, whereas 63.9 per cent said they were looking forward to it to some degree – 19 per cent of whom said they were “really looking forward” to resuming classes. Among primary school students, 79 per cent indicated they were eager to resume school, with 38.6 per cent indicating a strong preference, and only 3.2 per cent saying they were really not looking forward to it. A large minority of those in primary education also indicated that their enthusiasm for homeschooling had diminished during lockdown, with 42.9 per cent indicating they liked it less at the end than at the start, compared with 17.9 per cent who preferred it at the end of the period to the start. The study also gathered data from post-primary school students on their preference for a reshaped school week, with 41.5 per cent expressing a preference for attending two to three days a week, 18.4 saying they would prefer morning or afternoon classes, and 14.5 per cent opting for week-on, week-off attendance.

Photograph: Alan BetsonDavid Duffy, the managing director of Duffy’s Circus, lives, eats and breathes the big tent, the performers, the noise. This year, Duffy’s Circus, a staple of fairgrounds and festivals, celebrates its 150th anniversary. It could be its last.“There is a very high chance that we will not be coming back when we normally do in March. I would say there is a 20 per cent chance of us ever reopening,” said Duffy, the sixth generation of Duffys to run the circus.“It could very realistically be its last. I’ve never had to have that type of discussion before with my family, especially with my two sons Tom jnr, 27, and Jamie, 24, who have followed along into the business.”For the family, the lockdown has been a bitter blow, since Duffy’s continued in business during the Civil War, the War of Independence, even the foot-and-mouth crisis, only to be stopped in its tracks by Covid 19.Covid-19 has challenged the family in every other way, too. Duffy’s 91-year-old father, Tom, contracted the coronavirus: “The only way I can describe the past few months is by saying it has and is a hammer blow to us.“It was a scary time for him and all of us his children over the threat to his life. He managed to pull through, which is miraculous in itself itself. Now financially, the circus lifeline quite likely may not have any heartbeat left.”The circus will not return in August after the next phase of lockdown relaxations occur, if they occur, following a meeting in recent days between Mr Duffy, who shortly turns 60, and the family’s accountants.“We have to look at the realities of the circus industry and it’s not good. I don’t want to lose my sons from the business as I want the Duffy legacy to live on but facts have to be faced,” he said.With high insurance costs, Duffy’s, numerous other circuses and funfairs would be putting their companies at permanent risk if they were to reopen without the numbers needed to break even, he argues.Once circuses and funfairs restart, their insurance cover, which costs anything from €35,000 up to €60,000 annually, cannot be paused again, if they are forced to shut indefinitely if there is a second wave of Covid-19.“We understand many people will be saddened by this news, as are we. However, to protect both our company, staff and the communities we visit we feel we have no other option to see if we will even have a future next year,” he said.The circus tent holds 800 people. Currently, Covid restrictions limit numbers to just 50. Next month 100 may be allowed inside: “Unfortunately with the people involved in the performance we’d end up with an audience of 10.“Even if the cap on numbers didn’t exist it would be uneconomic for us to proceed with two-metre social distancing inside the big top. We feel cancelling the rest of the tour is the right thing to do.”Up to 120 families are directly affected: “Only one of the dozens of such entertainment companies is still operating and is trialling a novel approach of opening as a drive-through entertainment event.“No one knows how that will work out. There has been no cohesive approach by the Department of Culture and Heritage when it comes to urgent financial help and a decisive way on addressing increasing insurance costs.“We are always the poor cousin of the other traditional and even fine arts. It is forgotten that the industry employs tens of thousands of people annually,” said Mr O’Brien, who represents circus artistes of all types.“I’ve taken a calculated risk with my insurance payments by only bringing the Ferris wheel and some of the carousels back into operation.”The insurance premium has to be paid from July 23rd to February 28th next year: “If I’m forced to shut sooner, or Christmas doesn’t happen due to Covid restrictions, then financially the business is facing uncharted water.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4316073.1595964623!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"post brexit checks may deter firms like tesco from trading in northern ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords. Photograph: Tolga AkmenAFPGettyConcerns that big British businesses such as Tesco will be deterred from trading in Northern Ireland after Brexit have been raised in the House of Lords.Lord Kerr, the architect of article 50 which enabled the UK to exit the EU, has warned that the special arrangements put in place to avoid a border on the island of Ireland may be a fatal trade barrier for some companies.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, all businesses sending goods to the region from Great Britain will have to make formal declarations for the first time, with food sellers such as supermarkets subject to separate checks on chilled and fresh food from January.“How confident are you that GB businesses are just not going to write off the Northern Ireland market?” he asked the Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker who was appearing before the Lords EU committee.Just three weeks ago the first details of the new trading conditions across the Irish Sea emerged, with businesses obliged to complete three rounds of customs, security and transit forms on all goods being transported to Northern Ireland.Mr Walker said the government intended the new system to be “light touch” and streamlined.However, he faced further questions about the government’s preparedness with Lord Teverson questioning whether the new IT system, the Goods Vehicle Movement System, would be tested in time.And the former Conservative chancellor Lord Lamont challenged Boris Johnson’s repeated assertion that Northern Ireland businesses would continue to enjoy “unfettered access” to Great British markets.Lord Lamont argued there was a clear conflict in the Brexit protocol between article 5, which demands Northern Ireland businesses complete exit summary declarations for all goods being transported to the rest of the UK, and article 6, which promises “unfettered access”.“That is a rather awkward thing,” he told Mr Walker as he defended the government position, saying it was within the UK’s gift to ensure unfettered access.Mr Walker conceded that some of the detail of the protocol had yet to be agreed by the joint committee chaired by Michael Gove and the vice-president of the European Commission, Maroš Šefcovic.He also said details on the Northern Ireland border operating model, expected yesterday, would be published in the “coming weeks”. - "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Najib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet. Too many people died,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Holding an annual mass gathering of fasting and prayer from February 17 to 21 many branded the supercluster that turned Mulhouse into France’s Covid ground zero and the country into one of the world’s worst hit.For five days, around 2,200 people from around mainland and overseas France, neighbouring Switzerland and Germany and even Burkina Faso sang gospel and clasped hands.“We’re going to celebrate the Lord! Are you feeling the joy tonight?,” the charismatic pastor asked as they prayed for a miracle cure from ailments. Little did he know that the coronavirus had also entered the building and that almost his entire flock would be infected, 80 hospitalised and 31 die from the disease.When followers returned home, they unleashed what one top health official called a “viral nuclear bomb” whose fallout was felt around France.The health minister called it France’s “flipping point”. Its scientific council said without it, the country would be on a par with Germany - only 15 minutes away for 45,000 cross-border commuters but which suffered a third as many deaths.Twisting the knife, the state prefect of the Grand Est region, Josiane Chevalier, accused the church of failing to respect basic “social distancing measures: in short, everything you shouldn’t do”.The claims triggered torrents of hate mail. One of hundreds of messages read: “Thanks again for the French pandemic. We know who you are”.“The main culprit should have died so that this sect could answer for all the evil it has inflicted on Mulhouse!,” read another.Joining his hands, Mr Peterschmitt said: “We have received calls on social media to ‘gun him down with a Kalashnikov’ or ‘burn the church’. A colleague even received death threats at work.”Returning to the four corners of France, believers who fell ill said they were ostracised.Antoinette, a 70-year-old grandmother who lives on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, said she could not be fully identified as believers had been stigmatised by people outside the church for spreading the virus.“People have pointed their finger at me. They need a scapegoat, she said.Indeed, there is mounting evidence that the disease was already spreading relentlessly in the region before the gathering and that French health authorities had failed to pick up far earlier warning signs of impending disaster.President Emmanuel Macron gave a speech barely 200 yards from the church that very week. “He was shaking hands and taking selfies for an hour and a half,” said local shopkeeper Simsek Meleki, 40. \u0027Now people joke that Macron brought the virus with him.”Mr Peterschmitt asked: “How do expect us to know there was a risk if the President of France wasn’t aware of it?Two recent studies, one on chest X-rays in nearby Colmar, another quizzing 3,300 locals, suggest that that the first cases date back to November and that the epidemic had already taken off by mid-February in the area.Laurent Gerbaud, an epidemiologist at Clermont-Ferrand university hospital, said the findings suggested health authorities had failed to detect early warning signals.  “We have a woefully centralised bureaucracy incapable of receiving information from the ground up,” he said.All that said, there was little doubt, he added, that the church gathering turbo-charged contamination in France.Nobody felt ill during the event, but the following week, the pastor came down with flu-like symptoms and by Sunday, at least 800 people didn’t show up to church.On March 2, his son Jonathan tested positive and warned local health authorities about the gathering. That very same day, the first Covid patient was admitted to intensive care in Mulhouse’s Emile-Muller hospital.Joy Mootien, 54, chief consultant at the hospital’s medical intensive care unit remembered his patient zero well.“He was lying in his bed with breathing difficulties. When I saw the chest X-ray, I instinctively grabbed my mask,” he recalled. His family said he had not travelled recently but his wife did mention a large church gathering.“When I heard how big it was, I knew we were in trouble.”That night, Patrick Vogt, 64, a doctor fielding emergency calls in Mulhouse, witnessed the tidal wave.“More than 1,000 people rang in with such symptoms. It was frightening. We weren’t prepared here or in France,” he said. Despite the flood, state authorities calmly announced just six cases in the region the following day.“There was a chasm between what we were seeing on the ground and the official claims the virus was contained,” said Mr Vogt. “We lost two weeks pinpointing the church cluster,” he claimed.On March 5, gasping for air, Mr Peterschmitt was hospitalised. “I felt like a candle in the wind and thought my final hour had come. I was quite calm,” he said. Some 18 members of his family were struck down.That evening, Jean Rottner, 53, a casualty doctor and president of France’s Grand Est region sent a text message to President Emmanuel Macron.“I told him: ‘Watch out, what is happening here is not in line with the discourse we’re hearing in France. Please understand we’re in the midst of an epidemic.” In two days, the number of local cases multiplied by eight.French pride in its globally lauded public health took a huge knock when it realised that Germany was coping far better. Mr Rottner said this was partly down to mass testing, better communication between GPs and hospitals and far more intensive care beds - some 20,000 to France’s 5,000 at the start of the crisis.“But also we had this very particular cluster in Mulhouse which led to a brutal viral explosion. Germany didn’t have to deal with a problem of that magnitude.”At the hospital, very quickly all ICUs were full.“We were not on the front line, we were the front line,” said Marc Noizet, head of A\u0026ampE and emergency services.As critical patients kept arriving, soldiers were dispatched to construct a field hospital in the hospital car park with another 30 beds.Patients were ferried by helicopter to surrounding hospitals, then by plane and specially medicalised TGV fast trains to less affected regions of France. Others were sent to neighbouring Switzerland, Germany, as well as Luxemburg and Austria, whose hospitals were never underwater.In town, taxi driver Salah Aitabbes, 55, recalled: “It was like a science fiction movie with helicopters coming and going, the wail of ambulance sirens, empty streets and hearses.”A few hundred yards from the Open Door Church, Brigitte Ritz’s undertaker business was overwhelmed.“When you work with death, you tame your fear but this was different,” she said, arranging plastic flowers.“The funerary centre had coffins piled up with the air conditioning on full blast. When that was full, they were put in a special refrigerated hangar,” she said.Four months later, the death toll in the Grand Est region’s hospitals from Covid-19 is 3,383 with 1,809 more deaths in nursing homes. France, meanwhile, has just surpassed the 30,000 deaths mark.Many who did pull through intensive care are still struggling to recover.Malika Fisli, an auxiliary nurse from Mulhouse, was plunged into an artificial coma mid-March and woke up in Brest, western France, two weeks later.Today, she has lung scarring that will take up to nine months to heal and requires daily physio to regain 16kg of lost muscle. “I get breathless and have palpitations,” she said.“I still don’t dare go into shops and get angry when I see groups of people without masks.”Mrs Fisli worked in a nursing home, many of which turned into silent death traps. On her floor alone, ten among 49 elderly residents died of the disease and half her colleagues fell ill.She suffers from flashbacks in which she runs towards a blinding light and can hear a man saying: “Unplug her”. “But doctor, she’s only 58 and has four children,” another, female, voice chimes in.It was no nightmare. “During the coma, I heard these things. Afterwards, I asked the nurse if it was true. She went pale and confirmed that it was. I owe her my life,” she said. “But I don’t blame the doctor, he was only doing his job.”Like Malika, Mulhouse - a town with a proud industrial past sometimes referred to as the “French Manchester” - is slowly healing.“We were, without doubt, France’s ground zero,” said Mr Rottner, the Grand Est president.“We all know people who died, families that were affected. We won’t forget that. But we know our challenge is to shed this image of a region that was seriously hit by this disease and show that we can recover.”Others said it was high time to turn the page.“I’m fed up with Mulhouse being singled out as a pestilential city,” said Jean-Claude, a train conductor. “The truth is that for most of us it wasn’t as catastrophic as all that and certainly no worse than in Paris,” he said.As locals return to cafes, bars and restaurants, French health officials are fretting about an uptick in infections with the “R number”, which reflects infection rates, now above one in most regions. But ironically, the only one today below that dangerous watermark is the Grand Est.Back in his empty church, Mr Peterschmitt checked hand gel and spacing between chairs that have quartered capacity to 600.After weeks of online worship from his living room, he was finally about to meet the faithful in the flesh for the first time since that fateful gathering.Still weakened from his illness, he said he was worried about the future.“We’re in a very sensitive area here. What if a madman passed by and shot followers during the next worship?,” he asked.“Human beings are predators for their own kind. All this proves I was right to be a pastor and evangelist. Rousseau said, \u0027man is good but society corrupts him\u0027. The bible says, \u0027the heart of man is bad and society is simply its reflection.\u0027”“We are guilty of nothing. We were a fire in a forest already burning.”Despite his fears, he said he was looking forward to reconnecting with his flock.“I will tell them two things: how happy I am to see them again and to take heart: we can’t keep looking in the rear mirror.

Vienna, Amsterdam and Nice have the most availability.Ryanair and EasyJet have also cut prices – with some one-way flights available for under £10.BA sent its offer to executive club members on Monday after the prospects of a recovery in passenger traffic were hit by the Government reimposing quarantine on Spain on Saturday.“With over 100,000 reward seats available across our short-haul network, executive club members can pay in Avios and a flat fee in cash while we cover the taxes, fees and carrier charges,” said a BA spokesman.Ryanair has cut its prices on one-way flights from London Southend to Bilbao to £9.99 for Aug 27 to Pisa to £9.99 on Aug 19 and to Valencia at £9.99 on Aug 22.It is also offering London Stansted to Biarritz for £14.99 on Aug 25 London Luton to Nimes for £19.02 on Aug 27 Athens for £14.99 on Aug 18 Bologna £19.99 on Aug 17 and Alicante at £15 on Aug 19.EasyJet is offering London Gatwick to Alicante at £35.99 on Aug 10 to Barcelona at £28.99 on Aug 18 to Madrid at £26.99 on Aug 17 to Bordeaux at £40.99 on Aug 16 to Crete at £30.99 on Aug 23 and to Faro, Portugal, at £26.99, on Aug 11.David Skillicorn, commercial director of Prestige Holidays, said such price-cutting was necessary to rebuild confidence. “It is in the airline’s interest to fill these planes, get them moving, get people to come back and be interviewed at Gatwick or Manchester and asked, ‘How did you get on? What was the flight like? Did you mind wearing a mask?’” he said.“They’ll go, ‘No, I didn’t mind wearing a mask, it was great, I feel well, I had two weeks in the sun’ ... in the hope that this will encourage other people to go, ‘Perhaps this is the new normal.’”“It hurts the airlines desperately, but then, so does a pile of empty seats hurt them desperately.”“It is completely about building up confidence in their customers. They don’t want to be selling cheap seats. There is no way anyone on this planet, even Michael O’Leary can\u0027t argue that it is good business practice to charge eight quid for a passenger to go, it doesn’t go anywhere near the cost.With all but a handful of services grounded at the peak of the pandemic in Europe, BA was losing £20million a day. The airline proposed to make up to 1,255 pilots redundant as part of 12,000 cuts across the business.  Ryanair announced in May plans to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce staff pay by up to a fifth in response to the Covid-19 crisis, which has grounded flights.  EasyJet has said it will cut up to 30 per cent of its workforce - about 4,500 jobs - as it struggles with a collapse in air travel caused by the virus pandemic.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"must slim many nurses fat","story":"Shortly after reading Matt Hancock’s article about combatting obesity in yesterday’s paper, I emerged from a café to find my way virtually blocked by an enormously wide, youngish woman in a nurse’s uniform. It was a vivid reminder of a general fact about the National Health Service: many of its staff are fat.That matters, not only for the health of the NHS staff involved, but also for the effectiveness of any anti-obesity campaign. If the public are being urged to lose weight, they will not take the message seriously if they notice that a substantial proportion of those caring for them are not doing so. It reminds me of the days when lots of doctors still smoked.In his article, the Health Secretary also mentioned “stark inequalities in our nation’s health”. These are apparent within NHS staff. Sightings of fat NHS doctors are definitely unusual these days. Nurses and ancillary staff, on the other hand, are often disproportionately tubby.Why should this be? My guess is that the NHS, as a collectivity, is not a very health-conscious employer. What sort of food is served to hospital staff? Are they discouraged from eating too many American-style muffins? Certainly most hospital food for patients remains fattening and unappetising. Most hospital public coffee-shops groan under the weight of buns and fizzy drinks.The Government justifies an anti-obesity campaign partly in terms of the need to “help protect the health service”. As with its coronavirus slogan, this gets the problem back to front.Obviously, all citizens should behave well towards the public services. There is something even more disgusting, for example, about rioters who attack police and emergency services rather than just lamp-posts or one another. But the public do not exist to look after the NHS. The NHS exists to look after us.It will be an evil day if our defective lifestyle choices ever count against us when receiving medical treatment. When the AIDS epidemic began in the 1980s, one chief constable said that AIDS victims were “swirling around in a cesspool of their own making”. Even if this had been true, it would not have justified rationing or withholding their treatment. Motorcyclists and riders get more head injuries than the average. Drunks suffer from far more ailments than the sober.All of us, even the most virtuous, create work for the NHS simply by being alive, especially if we have the impertinence to get old. Don’t let’s go down the slippery slope of judging patients on their moral worth.The good reason for slimming is that you, and those dear to you, will usually have a happier and healthier life as a result. The message should be as simple as that.Last night’s BBC Panorama programme, China’s Coronavirus Cover-up, laid out the story efficiently. There can surely be no reasonable doubt that the Chinese Communist Party reacted slowly and mendaciously to the appearance of the virus. The results were literally fatal for thousands, arguably for hundreds of thousands all over the world. The programme brought this home.Two things, however, worried me. Both of them arose from the testimony of the programme’s star witness, Professor Kwok-Yung Yuen, who was part of the first delegation of external medical experts allowed to visit Wuhan.Professor Yuen spoke well and seemed wholly honourable, but it occurred to me that he might have fallen into a trap laid by the regime. He was told by the Wuhan authorities, he said, that the city’s wet market had been completely cleaned up before his arrival and that samples of only some of the animals there had been preserved. The implication, accepted by the programme, was that evidence of the disease’s origin had been erased.There is an alternative explanation. If it is true, as the scientists Angus Dalgleish and Birger Sorensen have posited in their learned paper on the subject (see this column, June 6) that the killer virus originated not in the market but in the Wuhan lab, then the reason for destroying much of the “evidence” from the wet market was not that the truth lay there, but that it did not. The Chinese wanted people to believe that the market contained something important, when actually it did not. You could put it thus: another creature from the animal kingdom, as well as bats and pangolins, had been available in the market – red herrings.My other doubt concerned Professor Yuen’s assertion that there had been “some cover-up locally”. I bet there was but surely the key point is that there was more than some cover-up nationally, at the highest level.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"not oxford history students should worried people marking exams","story":"Time was, when what examiners for a history paper wanted to know about a candidate was whether he or she had sufficient knowledge and understanding of a period to answer the question intelligently. And if the candidate could write fluently and legibly too, better again.Happy days, because now it seems historians at Oxford have to register all sorts of things besides: correct views on class and regions an obsession with gender and class issues and disdain for the story of monarchs.That at least is the gist of the examiners’ report from Oxford this year on preliminary exam papers. They complain that answers on the role of women in the early modern paper “produced some bad answers” including essays which “implied that the only women with any agency were those who became queens regnant”.Now consider that word “bad”. Is it “bad” in the sense of incorrect, viz, showing no grasp of the dynamics of the period, or errors of fact or no knowledge of the sources? Nope, what is bad about these essays are they unsound, viz, they have not absorbed the approved view in (parts of) the history faculty.For instance, the examiners expressed regret that of the students who took a paper in medieval Christendom and its neighbours, just 13 chose to write essays on women, men or gender.“The overwhelming majority of essays, that is, the other 185 essays, barely mentioned women,” they said.This, they reckon, should “worry everyone teaching the paper and everyone taking the paper”.Really? The one bit of freedom you have in an exam is to pick whatever essay questions you like. And if you’re more interested in the First Crusade than in the role of women as anchoresses, well, it’s a free world. Or at least, it was.And what is “remarkably bad” about dwelling on monarchs and queens? Granted, very many women did have agency in medieval and early modern Europe – but to dwell on the more obvious women (rulers), whom the sources actually talk about is not necessarily a bad answer but a reasonable choice.The examiners don’t like either the way some candidates treat particular social groups with “patronising disdain” – for instance, referring to the North as “backwards” and the Irish as “tribal”. Well, the Irish in this period were tribal, in the sense of primary allegiance being to a local ruler or family. But as with all these things, if the candidate knows his or her stuff and can argue the case, fair enough. Or at least that used to be what mattered.For later periods, it seems candidates wrote about class during Victorian and modern Britain “particularly poorly” with students showing “very little understanding of what class was”. Back in the Seventies, when Marxists were an actual thing there was a forensic interest in class all right, but it was a pretty partisan one.This examiners’ report is worrying all right, but for what it tells us about them. There are all sorts of things that should trouble us about history as a subject, chiefly the terrifying way in which European history is hardly taught in schools – though slavery and the civil rights movement is. These examiners would probably have taken a dim view of papers from AJP Taylor or Hugh Trevor Roper too, whose opinions on all these issues were off message. They were still brilliant historians possibly better than this lot.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/28/14/battery-charge-speed.jpg","title":"battery charging speed phone record qualcomm quick charge 5 android","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0027Qualcomm\u0027s\u0026nbspQuick Charge 5 not only provides superior charging capabilities but helps intelligently extend a device\u0027s battery life,\u0027 says Xiaomi managerSmartphones could soon be able to fully recharge in under 15 minutes after a new fast-charging standard was introduced.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The Emmy nominations for 2020 have been announced, with Watchmen, Succession and The Mandalorian all scoring prime spots in this year\u0027s list of contenders.Leslie Jones hosted the announcement on Tuesday. Laverne Cox, Josh Gad, and Orphan Black star Tatiana Maslaney joined as presenters via a virtual weblink.This year’s ceremony was thrown into question following the coronavirus pandemic, but events went back into motion with Tuesday\u0027s broadcast.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe 2020 Emmy Awards, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, will take place on 2 September.Here are the main talking points from the 2020 Emmys nominations:In a better world, Watchmen’s incredible success at this year’s Emmys wouldn’t be such a surprise. But considering the Emmys’ history with anything particularly difficult or ambitious (or even their history with sci-fi alone), the show’s stunning 26 nods feel groundbreaking. It couldn’t have happened to a more special programme. Adam WhiteThe Breaking Bad prequel may have a nomination in the main Drama category, but that voters didn\u0027t consider its lead stars worthy of acting nods is rather hard to comprehend. Bob Odenkirk and, in particular, Rhea Seehorn turned in their best work for the show\u0027s fifth season. But, with new blood such as The Morning Show and Succession, they\u0027ve been criminally pushed down the list. Jacob StolworthyThe Handmaid’s Tale star is a household name at the Emmys, having scored many nominations for both the dystopian show and Mad Men. She took home the trophy for Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 2017, and her continued portrayal of June in the HBO show could have resulted in another nomination this year. Alas, it wasn’t to be. Clémence MichallonNormal People was the most talked-about series of the early summer, but only took home one solitary nomination for its male lead, Paul Mescal. It’s a testament to his star-is-born charisma on the show, but disappointing overall considering the Sally Rooney adaptation was such a lightning rod for discussion just a few months ago. Adam WhiteThe inclusion of the Disney+ show on the list of nominees for Outstanding Drama Series is a considerable mark of prestige for the Star Wars series, which debuted in November last year to great acclaim. It also positions Disney+ as a serious contender in future awards races, alongside the likes of Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Amazon Studios. Clémence MichallonWhile Zendaya is a major star, it still feels quietly radical that her provocative drama series Euphoria scored her a Best Drama Actress nomination. With its sex and drugs and wall-to-wall nudity, the HBO series is sort of the antithesis of everything the Emmys historically like to spotlight. Adam WhiteNetflix’s true-crime series, which became a must-watch as many viewers around the world entered coronavirus lockdown, was always a bit of a “love it or hate it” programme. Clearly, the Emmys fall in the former camp: Tiger King is up for six awards, including Outstanding Documentary or Nonfiction Series. Clémence MichallonReese Witherspoon’s absence from the nominees came as a surprise, particularly as she has become enmeshed in television over the last two years. Despite her Apple TV+ series The Morning Show scoring a Best Drama Series nomination, and her co-stars Jennifer Aniston and Steve Carell receiving their own acting nods, Witherspoon went away empty-handed. The same thing occurred with Little Fires Everywhere, the limited series Witherspoon starred in and co-produced (her co-star Kerry Washington received a well-deserved nod instead), and even the second, polarising season of Big Little Lies. That appeared to be slightly forgotten altogether, with only nods for Meryl Streep and Laura Dern in the Supporting Actress category. Considering how the show’s first season dominated the limited-series awards in 2018, it feels like a statement on its lesser quality. Adam WhiteWhat We Do in the ShadowsWhat We Do in the Shadows may be one of the funniest shows on TV, but with no acting nominations, it seemed unlikely to be recognised in the main Comedy category. Colour us surprised, then, to see it rear its head, and while it\u0027s unlikely to win, it\u0027s reassuring to know that voters have been glamoured by its vampire characters\u0027 antics. Jacob StolworthyEighteen years after winning Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for Friends, Aniston scores her first nomination for a dramatic Emmy thanks to her performance on The Morning Show. She’s up for Lead Actress in a Drama Series alongside Olivia Colman, Zendaya, Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh, and Laura Linney. Clémence MichallonClaire Danes has had her fair share of Emmy love in the past with three nominations and one win since 2011, she certainly made her mark as Homeland character Carrie Mathison. However, considering voters have a history of nominating awarding winners for their final seasons (see: Jon Hamm for Mad Men, Bryan Cranston for Breaking Bad), a final nod for Danes wasn\u0027t entirely unexpected. Sadly, it wasn\u0027t to be. Jacob StolworthyFollow the live updates as they happened during this year’s nominations with our live blog below:Full list of nominationsLast year\u0027s list of winnersSo, first up, let\u0027s e into the Limited Series category (shows that were designed for one season). There are some real big-hitters in contention this year.Netflix wise, Unbelievable\u0026nbspseems to be the best bet, although other streaming services – namely Hulu – will be hoping to edge in with both Little Fires Everywhere and Mrs America.Hulu also has Normal People, which everyone in the UK and Ireland will no doubt be keeping its fingers crossed for.The runaway here, though, must be Watchmen, HBO\u0027s show-stopping\u0026nbspadaptation of the graphic novel from Damon Lindelof. It really has been one of the best things on TV in the past year.A nomination for Watchmen\u0026nbspwould go a long way to righting the wrong of snubbing Lindelof\u0027s previous series, The Leftovers, which is now considered one of the best shows of all time.Other contenders:Devs, I know This Much Is True, The Plot Against America, Unorthodox.It\u0027s pretty\u0026nbspcrowded over in the acting categories for Limited Series – in terms of lead star, all eyes are on Mark Ruffalo for his stirring portrayal of twins in I Know This Much Is True.Elsewhere, Russell Crowe should get a look-in for playing Roger Ailes in The Loudest Voice, while Hugh Jackman will likely be recognised for the lead role in TV film Bad Education (available now on Sky for anyone who\u0027s yet to see it).Who else is there? Paul Mescal for Normal People, of course, as well as Jeremy Irons for Watchmen. Could Aaron Paul sneak in for Breaking Bad film El Camino? Quite possibly.Leading the charge in the Best Actress in a Limited Series category\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspto be Regina King for her blistering work in Watchmen. If you\u0027re yet to watch it, start immediately.Will the Unbreakable\u0026nbsptrio\u0026nbspprove their worth at this year\u0027s ceremony? Merritt Wever, Toni Collette and Kaityln Dever are all standing by to see.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCate Blanchett (Mrs America), Kerry Washington (Little Fires Everywhere) and Daisy Edgar-Jones (Normal People) could all be named, too.Time to run through the Supporting Actor category for a Limited Series, which surely must feature Watchmen lads Tim Blake Nelson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II.Otherwise, perhaps Jim Parsons and Joe Mantello will be the only nominations for Ryan Murphy\u0027s Hollywood\u0026nbspwith John Turturro getting something for David Simon\u0027s The Plot Against America. We\u0027ll see.Time for Best Comedy Series, which – with any luck – will be Schitt\u0027s Creek\u0027s time to shine.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load...The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s never really, like, a conversation that goes on for a long time. Because I don’t think it’s very interesting … it’s not something that we talk about for a huge amount of time.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe continued: “Around the family dinner table, talking about my shorts, it wouldn’t be the most interesting conversation.”Mescal also shot down claims that his shorts are particularly small in size.Brad Pitt has received an Emmy nomination for two minutes of actingThe main talking points from the Emmy nominationsCourtney Love says she hopes Jeffrey Epstein ‘burns in hell’“See, I think to an outsider’s eye, they probably are,” he explained. “But to somebody who’s grown up playing football, they’re unfortunately the standard short length in football.”In the same interview, Mescal declined to comment on recent reports that he had been spotted eating breakfast with musician Phoebe Bridgers in Dublin.“Err, I’d rather not talk about that,” Mescal said. “Sorry.”Mescal’s Emmy nomination was the only nod the blockbuster limited series received at the annual event, which will take place on 20 September.To read a full list of this year’s nominees, click here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The farm at the centre of a horrific goat cruelty scandal revealed by The Independent may have to be shut down, its owner has said.Animals were secretly filmed being punched, kicked and slammed on their back at Far Marsh Farm, near Hull in East Yorkshire.Tesco, Waitrose, Sainsbury’s and Marks and Spencer all said they would immediately drop St Helen’s Farm dairy products – which are made using milk produced at Far Marsh – after being alerted to the brutality on Monday. On Tuesday, Ocado did likewise.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNow, Angus Wielkopolski, founder of Yorkshire Dairy Goats which owns the farm, has told The Independent he is disgusted by what he saw in the video and says he is facing having to close the 4,000-animal site if he cannot salvage its reputation.Three out of its 10 staff have already been dismissed for gross misconduct while a fourth has been placed on an immediate final written warning. On Tuesday morning, just hours after the abuse was revealed, CCTV was being installed across the plant so its general manager – who says he was unaware of the abuse – could monitor animal treatment by workers.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milk“We are totally shocked and disgusted by what we have seen on that video,” Mr Wielkopolski said. “We are horrified. We had no idea this was going on. If we had known, we would have stopped it instantly. We have always made animal welfare a top priority…“It’s a big farm which runs 18 hours a day, seven days a week and the manager can’t supervise everything. We trusted our people. We cannot believe that they have done this. I have to believe it because I have seen the footage but if you had told me two days ago this was happening, I wouldn’t have believed it.”Asked what the revelation might do to business, the 65-year-old said: “I don’t want to speculate at the moment but whether the farm continues, we will have to see. You cannot run a dairy farm if you cannot sell the milk. It is not possible.”Mr Wielkopolski and wife Kathleen have run Yorkshire Dairy Goats and sister business A\u0026ampK Wielkopolski for 35 years. They own a second farm, also in East Yorkshire, with another 4,000 goats.He said milk produced across the two sites had helped popularise the product in a period when increasing numbers of people have sought alternatives to cow’s milk. But he added: “We have worked hard for 35 years and that could all get destroyed overnight.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it is obvious that the opposite is true at one of their supplying farms.”About an hour’s worth of video was passed to the group.In it, goats at Far Marsh – which is between the villages of Keyingham and Ottringham – were seen being kicked and punched, beaten with a pole, held by the throat and having their tails twisted.In one clip, goats were slammed onto their backs on a conveyor belt before their hooves were roughly trimmed. In another, an animal was seen being dragged by one leg along the ground while struggling.All of Britain’s leading supermarket chains said on Monday they would remove the St Helen’s Farm range from their shelves pending further investigation after being shown the footage by The Independent.But Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose were continuing to sell the brand’s milk, cheese and butter in three south London supermarkets visited by The Independent on Tuesday.Waitrose and Tesco both said they had stopped new orders of the products but would sell remaining stock already in stores.“We take animal welfare very seriously and have suspended all new orders from this company yesterday while we investigate. So what you see on our shelves will have been received before this date,” a Waitrose spokesperson said.A spokesperson for Sainsbury’s insisted “all products are being removed from sale”.St Helen’s Farm – which also uses goats milk from several other farms – has already ceased buying produce from Yorkshire Dairy Goats.Speaking after the initial revelations on Monday, a company spokesperson said: “Today we have been made aware of allegations that one farm has infringed animal welfare standards, which we would find totally unacceptable if true.“We have immediately ceased all milk supply from this farm and launched a full investigation to determine the facts of this matter.”The Animal Welfare Act 2006 states animals, including farm animals, must be protected from pain, injury, suffering and disease.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Yet, the MPs found, as late as 2016, the time of the Brexit vote, GCHQ only devoted just 10 per cent of its resources to Russia. There has been a significant rise in those resources since then.Ms Cameron’s new post will also include dealing with the fallout from the decision to bar Huawei from the UK’s 5G network by 2027. The move, a volte-face by Boris Johnson’s government, came after a review was carried out by the NCSC following the impositions of new sanctions by the US on the Chinese telecommunications multinational.Smart speakers could be listening in on government secretsSedwill’s compensation payment will help get him out of the PM\u0027s hairBoris Johnson orders £250k \u0027compensation\u0027 to top civil servantMr Martin, the first head of the NCSC, has been appointed Professor of Practice in Public Management at the Blavatnik School of Government at Oxford University.Ms Cameron was born in Northern Ireland where her father Craig was a founding member of the Corrymela Peace and Reconciliation Centre, set up to promote dialogue between the Protestant and Catholic communities during the Troubles.She joins the NCSC from the Northern Ireland Office where she was deputy head to the Permanent Secretary, Sir Jonathan Evans. She had previously served as the Director-General in charge of the Department for International Development (Dfid) programmes in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.Ms Cameron, a graduate of the Ministry of Defence’s Royal College of Defence Studies (RCDS) served in Baghdad and Kabul for Dfid, and Helmand for the Foreign Office at particularly violent times in both conflicts. She worked in the Cabinet Office during the 2008 financial crisis.Ms Cameron said following her appointment: “Over the past four years, the NCSC has transformed the UK’s approach to cyber security and set a benchmark for other countries to follow. I am delighted to join the NCSC and relish the opportunity to take this world-leading organisation to the next level.”The Russia report deserves a far better response from the UKBlair calls on PM to probe Moscow\u0027s alleged interference in BrexitGovernment failure to probe Russian interference \u0027inexcusable’ Jeremy Fleming, the GCHQ Director said: “I am excited to welcome Lindy to the NCSC and GCHQ.

I think boards in these companies very quickly, if they were to ask these questions, could, without any need for regulation from government, improve the system a lot.“I think it’s time they realised that they have been putting their head in the sand for too long.”Mr Dimbleby, who said he struggles with his own weight, said he agreed that some fruit snacks are “being clothed in a veneer of goodness and might not be better for you than a Mars bar”.And he said there is “potential” to use “taxes to change the formulation of food”.But he said he does not agree with plain packaging for sweets, saying most people he has talked to feel that is too much in the way of government intervention.He urged the government to implement the recommendations in the report quickly.“In doing so, it will improve the health of the nation and be a necessary pillar of its ambition to level up society,” he said.The study further urged the government to only cut tariffs on products which meet the UK’s “core standards”.This would be achieved through “verification programmes”, enabling American farmers to sell non-hormone-treated meat to the UK, for example.Certification schemes should also be extended where the environmental impact is severe for example, maintaining tariffs on beef reared on land recently cleared of rainforest, the study said.Susan Jebb, professor of diet and population health from the University of Oxford, who worked on the report, said: “A nutritionally poor-quality diet is the leading risk factor for ill-health in the UK, yet we do not treat it with the same seriousness afforded to other risk factors. That has to change.“The Covid-19 pandemic has been a wake-up call that obesity in particular increases the risk of suffering serious complications from the virus, but a poor diet also increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.“This report makes clear the gravity of the situation and the stark inequalities that are evident across the food system.”Environment secretary George Eustice said the entire food supply chain had “worked around the clock” during the pandemic, while the “government has invested record levels to support the most vulnerable in our society”.“But we know there is more to do, and we will carefully consider this independent report and its recommendations as we emerge from the pandemic and build a stronger food system for the future,” he added.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The dissident artist said: “What is happening in Xinjiang is a look into the future of what will happen to Hong Kong. China sees it as simply a matter of domestic policy to crack down on minority groups by the hundreds of thousands. Tibetans have also faced similar treatment. It has been this way for years.” He added: “The Hong Kong situation has shown us that this authoritarian society will never give any space for discussion or negotiation. It is simply incapable of communicating with those with different ideas or ideologies.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“They have always been this way and as long as the communists exist will remain the same into the future,” he continued. “‘One Country, Two Systems’ was finished the moment China applied its national security law to Hong Kong. China violated its own promise. It is a society that is unreliable and cannot be negotiated with.”Ai Weiwei among top artists donating work to our campaign auctionWhen will the UK take action over China’s abuse of Uighur Muslims?‘Virtually entire’ clothing industry ‘linked to Uighur forced labour’The auction is raising money for The Felix Project. Founded by Justin Byam Shaw, the former chairman of The Independent, Felix is the largest food surplus distributor in the UK and our appeal beneficiary. Weiwei stressed the importance of ensuring people have enough to eat. “Sharing food is the most fundamental human gesture, beyond ideology or religion,” he said. “Food is essential. It has a much more profound meaning about how we understand ourselves and how we relate to our culture. But for those who lack necessary nutrition, it’s really a matter of human dignity. Too often that dignity is in a shattered state.“I have visited dozens of refugee camps around the world where people ate in unthinkable conditions,” he continued. “I remember seeing people wait in lines for hours simply for a cup of tea, people cooking over open flames without any tools. Sharing food is the most fundamental human gesture.”How to support our campaignSince the pandemic, Weiwei has launched himself into artistic and humanitarian projects. “Every event that happens around me has an impact on my work. I would have no work without the emotions or consciousness raised by those events.” In June he raised over £1m selling face coverings with his renowned motifs of sunflower seeds and a defiant middle finger to support the work of international humanitarian charities battling coronavirus. He has also produced three documentaries, one covering a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh and another about life in Wuhan amid the pandemic.Weiwei is no stranger to engaging with significant events in the Middle Kingdom. In 2009 for example, the Chinese government finally revealed the official death toll from the Sichuan earthquake after Weiwei launched his own investigation. At Munich’s Haus der Kunst he created an artwork – Remembering – out of 9,000 school backpacks to commemorate the students who died when their poorly-built classrooms collapsed after the earthquake.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe coronavirus and China’s subsequent reaction have done little to encourage Weiwei about the country’s status as an emerging superpower. He dismissed his homeland’s reaction to the virus as “untrustworthy, opaque and in denial of responsibility from the very beginning”, continuing: “The casualties are clear and factual. The conclusion from this crisis is still unknown. Many countries still deny the truth or shy away from it.” While he rejects the increasingly popular suggestion of a “new cold war between China and the west”, he warns that if the latter does not have a clear strategy, it “will lose this competition”. Weiwei’s father Ai Qing was one of China’s most eminent literary figures. He fell out of favour with the regime and the family was exiled to Xinjiang in the far west of the country, where his father was forced to clean communal latrines.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine Lagarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The word pound as a measure of weight originated from the ancient Roman term libra pondo’.The Latin word libra translated as balance or scales. This is also the reason that the zodiac sign Libra, which corresponds to the dates September  – October , is represented by a pair of scales.But, as part of the term libra pondo, this came to mean a pound by weight.The abbreviation ‘lb’ is borrowed from the ‘libra’ part of ‘libra pondo’.The etymology of pound has a number of sources in history.In its current form, pound dates back to Middle English , and was used to refer to a pound in weight.Looking further back, the word pund was used in Old English to mean the same thing. This was the earliest form of the English language, dating back to the mid-th century.But early uses of the word pound can also be attributed to the Proto-Germanic pundą, and the Proto-Indo-European pend. These were early forms of the languages that are now spoken in Western Eurasia. This goes to show that the word pound was not always just native to the English language.An early example of the word pound in popular culture can be found in William Shakespeare’s play The Merchant Of Venice. Jewish character Shylock lends money to his rival Antonio. When Antonio defaults on the loan, Shylock demands a pound of his flesh as a security interest. The Merchant Of Venice is believed to have been written between  and .Today, pound as a weight is used to refer to a mass that is equal to  ounces, or . grams.The abbreviation lb entered the English vocabulary in the late fourteenth century. This was around the same time libra pondo was first used. At the time, a pound in weight typically referred to a Roman pound, made up of  ounces, rather than the  ounces we know today.The abbreviation lb, in turn, led to an even shorter version of the word pound. This was a symbol we know today as the hashtag, or #.This symbol came about because the abbreviation lb was typically written with a short dash through the top of the l, joining to the curve of the b.When scrawled in a hurry in cursive writing, this resembled the symbol that came to be known as #.Today, this symbol is used interchangeably with lb as an abbreviation of the word pound.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It brought it back up to the surface and then held onto one end of the pig and started flicking it about.“The force generated is enough to tear off a limb, or even tear the animal in half. The crocodile will then repeat this process until the food starts getting smaller and smaller, and he has eaten all of it. Eventually, it gets quite messy because you’ve got guts going everywhere.“It took him  minutes to eat it all, but he ate the whole thing.

But there is hope - I think keeping our travel and tourism industry going, both at home and abroad, is so important.While most folk were supportive, there were those who scolded me, deeming a leisure holiday at this time an unnecessary luxury.Others shared their very real fears that the uncertainty over quarantines would make it almost impossible for them to take pre-planned holidays for the rest of the summer.Lets get real for a second:  per cent of the population CANNOT go on a holidayit means quarantining for two weeks - or even ten days - on the other side.Thats a ridiculous prospect.We are already in an era of fiscal catastrophe. The entire tourism industry is close to collapse. This uncertainty could be terminal.Of course, the government has to protect the UK from a potential second wave of coronavirus, but thats why any quarantine measures should be introduced with the utmost thought and caution.For example, there is absolutely no reason why the completely safe Balearics and Canary Islands - which include British tourist hotspots like Ibiza and Teneree - should be included within the blanket Spanish quarantine rules.In future, the government should also provide at least a weeks notice that they are considering introducing a quarantine to give consumers a choice to travel and take the hit of a y isolation period on their .The Spanish outbreak did not happen overnight so there could have been more warning.Testing should also be stepped up to make it easier for ing visitors. Given our growing capacity, why could everyone not be tested at the airport as they get back to the UK But my personal plea to you is this: If you have a holiday booked, dont panic and immediately cancel. If it works out like it did for me, it really is worth the little bit of extra stress.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged. He turns  in November and his fiancée Emma Krokdal is .We shrug this off because a he’s a bloke, b age is just a number and c what is  years between two lovers Except when I was questioned ahead of my appearance on Celeb First Dates Hotel last year about what age range I would consider for a partner, without a pause I said: “Twenty-five to .” My daughters were HORRIFIED.I’m nearly  and the idea of an older woman with a far younger man is deemed unthinkable and distasteful.

Even as Boris Johnson urges people to take staycations in the UK, new analysis shows regions which rely on tourism are being disproportionately hit by the rise in unemployment following the coronavirus pandemic.In areas where over a fth of workers are in tourism-related jobs, the number of working-age adults claiming unemployment-related benefits has risen by % since February - compared to % for the UK as a whole.Labour leader Keir Starmer has called for an extension of the Governmentaposs furlough scheme for the worst-hit sectors, including domestic tourism.Ahead of a visit to Falmouth in Cornwall, Sir Keir warned the UK’s world-class destinations are “falling through the cracks” as the Government prepares to wind down the scheme. Some % of workers in Falmouth are in tourism related jobs - and the claimant count has risen by % since February. He said: We are lucky to have many world-class tourist destinations across the UK. “But the jobs crisis facing tourist towns is stark. There are fantastic domestic options for British holidaymakers, but the crucial summer season has been cut short. “With many businesses still unable to reopen fully, the Government’s one-size-fits-all approach to jobs risks these towns falling through the cracks. “We need a targeted extension of the furlough scheme for the hardest-hit sectors and proper support in place to help those who are unemployed back into work.“  In May, the Mirror revealed the ten towns working in lockdown-hit industries had an average monthly pay packet nearly £ lighter than the UK average before the crisis. And lockdown rules, as well as the Governmentaposs haphazard border quarantine regime, has robbed the struggling tourism industry of much of the popular Summer months it needed to stay afloat.

In March, the Government ordered . million people with serious health conditions to stay indoors to protect them from coronavirus. The restrictions have been slowly eased, with shielded people allowed to meet up with up to five people from July . And from August  the shielding advice will end completely - unless there is a spike in coronavirus cases.It comes as part of wider easing of lockdown measures, with Boris Johnson keen to get the country back to work to boost the flagging economy. But some experts remain concerned about the impact of a wider reopening of society, as while coronavirus rates have been falling, there have been local outbreaks in places such as Leicester and Blackburn with Darwen. Here are the answers to your questions on the end of shielding. Who was told to shield by the Government   Millions of people received letters from the Government telling them to shield because of their medical history.Doctors drew up a list of conditions likely to make people particularly at risk of being seriously ill with coronavirus.This included organ donor recipients, people with certain types of cancer and those with severe respiratory conditions such as asthma and cystic fibrosis. Pregnant women, some people over s and those who usually need a flu jab to cope with underlying health conditions were also told to shield. However the advice was not compulsory - it was for peopleaposs own protection from the virus. What will change from August From the beginning of August, the Government is pausing advice to people to shield unless there is a spike in coronavirus cases.After months of lockdown, shielded people will be able toto work, to go to the shops, to exercise outside and visit places of worship, as long as they observe social distancing. Children who are deemed clinically vulnerable can go back to school when term begins. However the official advice is still to be careful as the risk of vulnerable people getting severely ill from coronavirus remains. People are told to stay at home as much as you can and continue to take precautions when you do go out. Regular handwashing, avoiding touching your face, and keeping two metres away from people outside is still advised.  Will the support end  Free food parcels, medicine deliveries and care offered to shielded people will stop from August . But vulnerable people can still rely on help from NHS Volunteer Responders to pick up their groceries and prescriptions. You can still get priority slots for online shoppingyou are already registered. What had already changed on July   Vulnerable people were given the go ahead to meet up with up to five friends after months without being allowed to socialise. The Government announced shielded people could form support bubbles with one other household - allowing people to meet inside and outside without social distancing. Those shielding were told they no longer needed to social distance from people living in their own household. WhatI am worried about going back to work   The Government guidance says vulnerable people canto workthey cannot work from home. Employers must ensure that social distancing measures are in place. If you are able to work from home then your boss is expected to help you to do so. From August , shielded people will no longer be able to claim Statutory Sick Pay unless they develop symptoms - in line with the rest of the population.

Detailed guides for each type of workplace are here. The exception isyouaposre aposshieldingapos due to being extremely clinically vulnerable to Covid-. If youaposre shielding, you should still work from home or -your employer wonapost pay you - claim Statutory Sick Pay. What is changing on August    Instead of the government telling everyone who can work from home to do so, firms will decide who comes into the workplace.Announcing the change, Boris Johnson said: We are going to give employers more discretion.That could mean of course continuing to work from home, which is one way of working safely and which has worked for many employers and employees. Or it could mean making workplaces safe by following Covid Secure guidelines. Shielding is also ending on August  - more of this below - so many of those .million people will be asked to go back to the workplace at the same time. Why are things changing   Boris Johnson announced the change amid growing fears city centre economies will grind to a halt. Sandwich shops, pubs and restaurants face going bankruptworkers are kept away completely - and with them will go thousands of staff. Coronavirus rates had also been falling steadily before the PMaposs announcement on July , though there have been a number of local outbreaks since.And there is - at least in theory - a decent Test and Trace system in place meaning any office outbreaks can be detected quickly. However, the change isnapost without controversy. The PMaposs own Chief Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance warned on July : We are still at a time when distancing measures are important. Of the ious distancing measures, working from home remains a perfectly good option for many companies because it is easy to do. A number of companies do not think it is detrimental to productivity, and in that situation I see absolutely no reason to change it. Should I take public transport   People are asked to take alternative means to get to workthey can - walking, cycling or even driving. But people may also now use public transport for non-essential journeys, even though they are encouraged to use other optionspossible. So yes, you may use public transport to get to work. Though you will need to wear a face covering and are advised to avoid rush hourpossible. Can I still work from homeI want   If you can do your job perfectly well from home, you should make that argument to your boss.The government is not ordering everyone to go back to work. Instead, it is saying everyonecango back.In reality, many offices will have far lower capacity than before so many companies are likely to still have some staff working from home. However, ultimately this is a decision for your firm. The big dference is that from August , there is no government rule on keeping you away from HQ - itaposs a conversation you have to have with your boss.  No one can physically force you to go into an office of course. Butyouaposre talking about facing the threat of the sack - then yes, basically they can. As long as the workplace is safe, employers can ask people toto work. Many people may have their usual place of work embedded in their employment contract.And there is not a legal right to demand to work from home. Thereaposs a legal right torequestflexible working, but your company only has to engage with your request properly - they donapost have to grant it.The government says firms should consult closely with their employees on what they decide. But Acas says: If someone refuses to attend work without a valid reason, it could result in disciplinary action. Itaposs a slightly dferent kettle of fishthe workplace is unsafe - more on this below.  Can my boss force me to go backitaposs not safe  No -your workplace is not aposCovid-secureapos, your firm should not be asking you back. However, critics say there is no easy redress for workers who believe bosses are breaking the rules. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman urged firms to take socially responsible” decisions, adding: We’re not prescribing what businesses should do, provided that they make the environment safe. Rogue firms can be reported to the Health and Safety Executive, or workers could bring a complaint or go to arbitration service Acas. And employment lawyer Matt Gingell suggested such issues could end up at an employment tribunal. These can all be y processes which take many months to resolve. He said: If an employee refuses toto the workplace due to the employee reasonably believing imminent and serious danger and is then dismissed for that reason the employee could, depending on the circumstances, have a claim for unfair dismissal. The requirement that the employee has to believe that there is imminent and serious danger, does limit the right. WhatIaposm pregnant or have asthma   If you are pregnant or have asthma, diabetes, heart disease or liver disease, you are classed as clinically vulnerable. This means you are not sick enough to be shielding, but that you are at a higher risk from Covid-. If you fall into this category, you can still go back to work where possible. However, you should take extra care in observing social distancing. If you can work from home, your employer should help you to do so. If you canapost work from home, you should be offered the safest available on-site roles, enabling you to stay  metres away from others. This could mean being placed in a dferent role. If you canapost stay two metres from others, your employer should assess whether this involves an acceptable level of risk. If unacceptable risks cannot be removed, pregnant women are entitled to be suspended on full pay.A full list of conditions for the clinically vulnerable group is here. WhatI have children   There is no extra childcare help that came with the back to work order - despite it starting just as the summer holidays got under way. Parents of the youngest children can get up to  hours a week of free childcare, and schools are being encouraged to run catch-up schemes. Parents are also entitled to up to four weeks per year of parental leave for each child - but this is unpaid. It is also capped at  weeks for each child between birth and their th birthday.Labouraposs Keir Starmer has said the Prime Minister is putting parents in an “impossible position”. He said: Despite ordering millions of parents back to the office, the Prime Minister has refused to provide any extra help for families, penalising parents by putting them in an impossible position.“Parents got a back-to-work notice just as the summer holidays began. But they got no support for structured activities, no summer catch-up schemes, and no support for a childcare sector on its knees. WhatIaposve been shielding   Shielding for .million extremely clinically vulnerable people will end in England on August . There may be exceptions to thisthere is a local outbreak in your area. Please check with your local council. If you have been shielding, the government advises that you canto work from August  -you canapost work from home. However, you should adopt strict social distancing, and remain cautious. WhatIaposm on furlough  Furlough will not end on August  and continues right up to October . However, it will start winding down, with firms having to contribute some of the costs of their workers from August . That means firms are likely to take more staff off furlough or - in the worst-case scenario - make them redundant. This is a conversation you should have with your employer. No new staff can be put on furlough - butyou were furloughed previously, you can be re-furloughed. Again, this is a conversation to have with your boss.

Edna Dalchin does not have a bank card and was told to put her items back as Nottinghamshireaposs Birds bakery could not take her money.The elderly lady said she was shocked and embarrassed but the company told Nottinghamshire Live that one of the agreements of them reopening was that they would not accept as it is dirty.But Edna, who lived through the Second World War and worked in a hosiery, prefers to pay the old fashioned way. In fact, she has never even owned a bank card. Edna, of Basford in Nottingham and who was attempting to buy bread from the bakery in the market town of Bulwell, said: I went into Birds because I wanted a loaf of bread and some potted meat. She said to me aposhave you got a card apos I did not know what she was on about. I said aposOh I have never used a card in my le. I always pay the old fashioned way, which is how I was brought up. I felt like I was being treated like a small child and being talked down too. None of the other shops have ever refused my money. There is a virus, I understand that, but a lot of elderly people do not use cards and are not into that technology. A manager at a Birds branch said they are not accepting cash for hygiene reasons and they want to minimise any risk to staff and customers. Lisa Clarke, manager of Birds in Arnold, said: One of the arrangements is we could openit is card only and because cash is dirty.With the coronavirus and pandemic they want to minimise the risk to ourselves and customers.She said around eight elderly people had been stopped since the store reopened in April but most elderly people were now using cards in their store. If they have not got a card unfortunately we canapost give them the goods. Whether it will change in the future as guidelines change, she added.  Edna said she has used cash for all her shops during the coronavirus pandemic at stores including at Tesco and Morrisons. And she is not the only pensioner who has been refused essential items at a Birds store unless she pays on card. Grandma Glynis Kirk, , of Basford, was also told she could not buy some pork pies without paying on her card. She has described the situation as disgusting as she only uses her card for her big shop at Morrisons and not for small purchases. Edna said she usually gets her money from the Post Office each week, which allows her to pay for her essentials including food. Glynis, who is good friends with Edna, added: I went into Arnold last Wednesday and went into Birds for a couple of pork pies. It was £.. I was told aposyou have to use your card.apos The only time I use it is with my big shops in Morrisons to last me all week. I have never known a shop to ask for your card. Edna is an elderly lady and to treat her like that is just disgusting. She had to leave it and come out of the shop.

Tragic Kayden Cantlow was killed last Wednesday when he was struck by a train. His devastated family say he was able to get through the barriers onto an overpass in order to take his own le. Kaydenaposs death came just three days after the first anniversary of mum Michelleaposs death from cancer, aged just . Now, Kaydenaposs dad and older brother Francis, , are campaigning to encourage others to open up and talk about their mental health. The family, from Colchester, Essex, want to install a large board on the railway bridge with contact details for the Samaritans.  They have also set up a petition to try and get more barriers put up around the overpass - which links St Anneaposs and St Johnaposs in Colchester - to make it more dficult for people to access it. Kayden, a pupil at The Gilberd School in Colchester, was the youngest of six children - with older brothers Alex, , Jordan, , Nathan, , and Francis, , and sister Sapphire, . His brother Francis said: He was always a mummyaposs boy. He just wanted to be with his mum again. We have spoken to people at The Gilberd School where he went and they have said every bit of footage they have of him, he is grinning and laughing with all his friends. He was not being bullied or anything like that - it was nothing from the outside.  He was quiet but popular. He always had a smile on his face. He found a way of getting through the barriers, so I need to bring awareness to that and get it fixed. If we can get it fixed here then I want to move on and do more and make it safe. I also want to make it normal for people to talk about their mental health.  Men especially find it dficult and tend to bottle it up. That is what happened with Kayden. If you keep things bottled up then eventually it will explode. You can’t keep putting things into an already full bottle. Francis has already been in touch with councillors about the safety issue and is determined to talk about mental health issues in primary schools once they reopen.  And Kaydenaposs dad Vinny, , added that the family had no inkling anything was wrong last Wednesday before Kayden died - and said his son had even posted a letter for him as a favour. Vinny said: He was a quiet lad but he always had a smile. He decided to go be with his mum, he just wanted to be back in her arms. Us sitting around moping is just not going to help anyone. If we can get some awareness out there and help even one person then it will be worth it. If one person is feeling low and sees the number of someone they can talk to, then we have made a dference.  It is what Kayden would have wanted. He was always so kind and helpful. Just days before Kaydenaposs death, Vinny had posted an emotional tribute on Facebook to his we Michelle, a year on from her death. Sharing a photo of her, he had written: Today is the first anniversary of the passing of my beautul we Michelle. Not a day passes that I donapost think of her or talk about her. She is always in my thoughts and my love is as strong as always. Miss you so much darling and I hope Iaposm making you proud. Love you so much.

Mum Laura Hodgson, , her three kids and partner Corey Jackson, , were due to stay in Las Piramides hotel after landing on Friday, July . But after finding it deserted they fear they might have to stop on the beach instead. Ms Hodgson says they were left with no answers upon arrival - having been unable to find a contact number for online travel agent Loveholidays in order to find out what to do next. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE  When we saw the hotel we were so shocked, the print factory worker told Nottinghamshire Live. There was dust all over the windows and it looked like it had been closed for months. We walked around the outside of the hotel and noticed there was no water in the pool and there were blankets all over the furniture inside. At the time I tried to get hold of Loveholidays  on the phone and there was no number online, I couldnapost get hold of anyone. We didnapost know what to do - at one point we actually thought we might have to stop on the beach - so we walked around the corner and went into another hotel for help. I canapost fault the guy in that hotel, he was really helpful. He said there had been a few people from our hotel who had turned up asking why it wasnapost open. Ms Hodgson and the family were offered short-term accommodation in the nearby hotel, which totalled € for the five people - nearly all their spending money.  They then got talking to another family in the new hotel who had suffered the same problem at Las Piramides - but had been told in advance that it was closed. The other people managed to find us an emergency contact number for Loveholidays  that wasnapost online, Ms Hodgson added. They helped us get hold of them on the Saturday and  Loveholidays  arranged for us to get another hotel. It wasnapost that far away but we lost  hours of our holiday by ringing around trying to find out why we were supposed to be for the rest of the holiday. The parents say they were glad to have somewhere to stay after the fear of having nowhere, but say they have still had no answers from the company about why they were not informed earlier. Ms Hodgson said her son Cruz, now , had his birthday on the holiday which was ruined by the fear of being stranded in a foreign country. It wouldnapost have been so badit was just me and Cory, but we had three kids so it was really scary, she added. It was my sonaposs birthday and at the time we didnapost know where we would be, so that made it even worse and his birthday was ruined. We have had no answers from  Loveholidays  about why it was closed, Iaposve had no explanation as to why we didnapost find out when we got there. However, the company has supported the family by providing a refund and compensating the money for the temporary hotel accommodation - which Ms Hodgson confirmed has arrived back in her account. The family have, however, been afforded one stroke of luck - arriving back into the UK on Friday, July  and just missing the new two-week quarantine rule on arrivals from Spain - a decision Ms Hodgson describes as stupid. Loveholidays apologised to the family for the inconvenience and said it has seen a number of cases where hotels have not reopened as planned. A spokesperson for the firm said: We understand how frustrating and upsetting it must have been for Ms Hodgson and her family to arrive at their destination to find that their hotel was closed. Unfortunately, the hotel that they were supposed to stay at was due to re-open prior to their arrival, but this did not happen as planned and we were regrettably not informed about this.

Dean and Louise Fox, along with their two children, Harry, , and Annabelle, , were set to move into their brand new home in September after saving up years to build it. Dean and Louise bought a plot of land in County Durham and began building their home, which was to be called Harbelle, after their kids, in January. They had hoped the house, which was almost finished, would secure their childrenaposs future until they received a phone call which will haunt them forever in the early hours of July  telling them that it was on fire.  Louise, , told ChornicleLive : Those words will haunt us forever.I just thought someone must have set a little fire next to the house I never imagined how bad it actually was. I just donapost know how anyone can be so heartless. Her husband Dean, , was working  hour days to get the house in Station Town, near Wingate, finished missing out on valuable time with his we and kids. Dean, who is a joiner by trade, said it was his dream to build his own house and wanted to finish it for his children. He said: I was working around the clock to get it done and we were nearly there. Iaposm physically exhausted. I would go to work and then head straight to the house to start work again. I missed out on seeing my kids and we just to get it finished. We were just trying our best to improve our lives and better ourselves. I thought it would secure the future for us and put us in a better position. The driving force behind it was our kids. Our kids were going to be in a better financial place. It was our dream. We loved watching Grand Designs. I just canapost believe whataposs happened, itaposs only just sunk in. The day before it was my daughteraposs fourth birthday so that was ruined too. Recalling the horric day, Dean said he was woken up by a phone call between . and .am to say their house was on fire and immediately rushed down. Little did he know that he didnapost need the keys for the house- because there was hardly any of it left. Dean said: We got a phone call to say: aposYou need to get up here, your house is on fire.apos As I was coming up the lane, I saw blue lights and we had a massive window which was completely gone and I just remember seeing orange, thataposs when I knew it was bad. Louise was Facetiming me and asked me what it was like, I turned the phone around and just said itaposs gone. The first thing my son said to me was: aposYouaposve worked so hard dadapos and he was sobbing his heart out. That will always stick out in my head. Louise was just uncontrollably crying. I just wanted to provide for my kids and now all that has gone. The couple is waiting to have the damage assessed by their home insurance, but fear the payout may not cover the full costs. But to help alleviate some of the financial pressure a fundraising page was set up by a family friend which has so far raised over £, in just a matter of days. The page reads: Myself, family and friends are helpless and can’t take this awful day away butwe can try and pull together as a community to support and relive the family of additional financial stress, then every little helps. This is not charity as the family are proud but it’s friends trying to do what we can in dficult times! We would, therefore, appreciate any contributions, whether that be £ or  hour of your time to help give the family a head start at rebuilding their home after knowing they have poured their le savings and more into building this house! Local residents rushed to the support of the family which they said has helped spur them on. Despite their heartache, the family are determined to start again and have vowed to overcome the devastating fire. Dean said: The reaction of the village was just amazing. People were crying on the streets walking past because they had seen it being built from the ground up. People would drive past to see the progress, it was going to improve the area and people were happy to see it there. At first I just thought I canapost do it again and Louise said she wanted to move out of Wingate and I didnapost blame her but after the response we had, we just knew we had to start again. We werenapost prepared for it, it was just overwhelming. Iaposm happy Iaposm from Wingate with all the support weaposve had. Everyone has got each otheraposs back, they look out for each other and thataposs the kind of place we want to live in.

Leon restaurant founder Henry Dimbleby warned poorer children risk being “left behind” and demanded action to avoid a “slow-motion disaster”.He delivered the National Food Strategy amid fears thousands of children will go hungry after the coronavirus pandemic.Mr Dimbleby said: “One of the miserable legacies of Covid- is likely to be a dramatic increase in unemployment and poverty, and therefore hunger. “The effects of hunger on young bodiesare serious and long-lasting, and exacerbate social inequalities.”  It comes as it emerged Boris Johnson’s junk food advertising watershed of pm will take two years to be introduced.Despite health campaigners saying the ban is “long overdue” ministers will give food firms the time to make food healthy enough to promote.  The study proposes an expansion of free school meals to every child where a parent is receiving Universal Credit.At present, only children from households earning less than £, before benefits are eligible. Mr Dimbleby added: “Children who are hungry at school struggle to concentrate, perform poorly, and have worse attendance records.” Expanding the programme could reach an additional . million seven to -year-olds at a cost of £ million a year. The report also calls for an expansion of the holiday activity and food programme to all areas in England, reaching an extra . million children at a cost of £ million a year. And it urges an increase in the value of Healthy Start vouchers to £. per week and expansion of the scheme to pregnant woman and households in receipt of Universal Credit with children under four. The vouchers can be spent on vitamins, fruit, vegetables and milk, and the recommendation would mean an extra , pregnant women and under-fours would benefit, the study said.

Joe Mills, who has a YouTube channel called aposDigging for Dinnerapos that shows people how to grow fruit and veg on an allotment, said it was obvious it was a targeted attack on him. His entire crop of this yearaposs vegetables have been ruined after being doused in paint and nish. Many of his , subscribers have suggested the saboteur is someone who is envious of his successful allotment and of his YouTube channel. Mr Mills, , was alerted by a fellow allotment holder at Roeshot Hill Allotments in Christchurch, Dorset, that all the plants he had spent months growing had been sabotaged. His lettuces, tomatoes, onions and potatoes had all been covered with sticky paint and nish. Joe said the attack is apostruly devastatingapos and will bring an early end to the aposGrow With Meapos video series he had been filming for his channel. He said: Someone has taken it upon themselves to completely sabotage all of my efforts to grow my own food.  There was lots of nish, gloss and dferent kinds of paint directly thrown over all my plants. The level of sabotage, it is obvious it was a targeted attack and what they have done is to write me off for the year. I donapost think anything is going to survive, I think itaposs going to kill it all off. It looks like someone doesnapost like me. It was described to me by a committee member as a personal attack.  I donapost know who would have done it. Who has got it in for me  Evenyou donapost like me, who would take their frustrations out on plants  The damage is too neat, it is on every single bed and only on the plants, not sporadically thrown  They have taken their time to go up and down the vegetation. His partner Kelly Daley added: We canapost fathom it, we have no idea why someone would pick on Joe. His allotment is tucked out of the way and no other allotments had been hit.  It could be someone on one of the allotments who is jealous of how quickly he has got it looking good. The allotment is Joeaposs place where he has focus and purpose. He was devastated and this could easily have consumed him. Itaposs just really sad. Mr Mills focuses on showing people that gardening doesnapost have to be complicated and aims to help those with mental health issues.  At one point he managed  allotment plots in London but moved from Windsor, Berks, to Dorset with his Kelly almost a year ago. He still has two allotments in London. He said he spends six or seven hours a day at the Christchurch plot. Many of his crops were close to being ready to harvest, including about  onions that he had pulled up and left to dry the day before the saboteur hit on July . He also had  Roma tomato plants which he said would probably die now, and eventhey didnapost he wouldnapost feel comfortable eating them because of the substances that had been thrown on them.

Maggie Munro, aged , fractured her femur at the Silver Sands beach in Aberdour, Fe, during a day out with her family - with the dogs running off their leads. The unfortunate child must now spend up to two months in a hip to toe cast, but despite the incident sheaposs still desperate for a pet dog of her own.The Edinburgh girl is recovering well at home and her parents have issued a warning to dog owners to be more careful in public places, reports the Daily Record. They fear it was only luck which meant the situation wasnapost any worse for little Maggie, with the dogs only just missing her baby sister Molly. Mum Mhairi, , said: It was two dogs owned by two dferent owners and they were just playing and excited to see each other, but they basically ran full tilt and took Maggie out and skittled her. They just skfed our nine-month-old who was sitting down by my feet at the time.  I did not notice them coming straight towards us and it all happened in a flash. I scooped Maggie up and when I tried to put her back down on the sand, the minute her foot was on it I knew that was not possible, so I carried her off the sand to a grassy area and bench where my brother was sitting. Mhairi said one of the dog owners came over to see how Maggie was but the owners of the other dog appeared to have disappeared without an apology after the incident. Paramedics moved Maggie onto a stretcher and drove her to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, where she had the bone realigned and was put in a cast. X-rays taken at the time showed a clean break of Maggieaposs left femur bone just a few centimetres above the knee cap. Dad Gregor added: Should your dog be running around at full tilt when other people are around  Maybe owners should rein them in around kids. These were decent sized dogs going at high speed and, in some way, itaposs lucky Molly did not bear the brunt because the situation could have been worse.

A survey of , UK adults, by OnePoll, found more than half -  percent - think the controversial biography ‘Finding Freedom’ - out next month but heavily serialised in the last week - as well as the couple’s public airing of private family matters has been “inappropriate”. Two thirds -  percent - said they had been saddened to watch Harry and Meghan’s relationship with the royal family, particularly The Queen, deteriorate in such a public fashion. As a result,  percent believe the LA-based couple “have made their bed” and should be booted out of the The Firm for good. The bombshell biography enraged the majority of people who found the public rt disrespectful to the Queen and the family. The overall popularity of the royals has already taken a beating in light of the scandal involving Prince Andrew’s relationship with convicted sex abuser Jeffrey Epstein, only to be compounded by Harry and Meghan’s decision to leave their royal roles. More than half -  per cent - say their opinion on the royals had gone down since the allegations about Prince Andrew became public. Almost a third -  percent - admitted their opinion on the wider Royal Family had fallen since the ‘Megxit’ fallout.

Sandra Isirima was studying at Queen’s University in Belfast and her husband, Michael was in the final year of his PhD Ulster University, when he was diagnosed with stage four cancer.He was given just a few months to live and died on November ,  aged just , BelfastLive reports.Eight months later, Sandra had fulfilled her husbandaposs dying wishes, and celebrated her graduation with her sons Mike, six, Micah, four, and two-year-old twins Mitchy and Myron, at their home in Belfast in a virtual ceremony. Sandra has gained a Master’s degree in Leadership for Sustainable Development from the School of Biological Sciences. She said: “I became a widow at the age of  with four young boys under the age of six. I felt like giving up everything. Then I remembered Michael’s wishes and after taking a good look at my boys, knowing I’m their only surviving parent, all I wanted was to give them a better future.” Even in the depth of his health crisis he did all he could to encourage Sandra. She said: “Michael was so encouraging and supportive of me that he asked me to never give up on my dreams of getting my Master’s. “He supported me in the little ways he could and always encouraged me not to drop out of school because of his illness. “I found courage, hope and strength, and I finally decided to go back to school to complete my Master’s degree.” “Michael was so hardworking and industrious. He was diagnosed with cancer in his final year of his PhD, but he never gave up on his dreams. “He was so brave, he worked on his PhD even on his sick bed. “Myself and the kids picked up his degree on his behalf as he it was awarded posthumously to him by Ulster University. His research was on fire safety engineering and Michael also volunteered with Fire NI during his PhD.” Sandra, originally from Nigeria, turned to friends for support during her toughest times and found encouragement and help amongst her strength and support from her tutors from the School of Biological Sciences. She explained she found family in her university who helped her meet deadlines and literally keep going when she felt ready to give up from her class mates, the course co-ordinator and tutors. Sandra said: “The thought of knowing I belonged to a community as supportive as Queen’s kept me going and gave me hope for the future. “My course supervisor Dr Jude Stephens was so amazing and some of my course mates were present at my late husband’s memorial service to support me and my family in my darkest time. I am glad I have a family at Queen’s who care about my welfare.

Sharon McElroy was given the heartbreaking news that her son Karl would not be coming home  years ago. It came as a complete shock to the family, who knew him as a happy and popular young man.He was just  years old and had been on a night out with his friends but was found dead the following morning, the Manchester Evening News reports.The tragic news hit the family hard and had a particularly profound impact on his younger brother. Lee McElroy was described by his sister Katie Fierro as having a heart of gold and being someone who truly cared for everyone around him. But, on February  this year - four days after celebrating his th birthday - he too was found dead at his mumaposs home in Salford having taken his own le. He was a father to three children aged ,  and eight, as well as another son who tragically died at just a few days old. Leeaposs struggles with depression had plagued him throughout much of his le and his family believe these issues, partly triggered by the death of his much-loved brother, pushed him to turn to alcohol and later cocaine which he became addicted to. At an inquest into his death held this week, Bolton Coroners Court heard that he had regularly spoken about suicide and had once previously been taken to hospital following an overdose. Talking about her son, Sharon said: When he was happy he was very happy and he would do anything for anyone. Nothing was too much trouble. But, she believes Lee struggled to speak about some of the worries that were affecting him and felt like he could not discuss the problems he was having with substances. I think it needs talking about more in schools.  Lee would never admit to having a drinking problem and he would never tell us he was taking drugs. He was hiding it because I think he was ashamed. It was so hard to get him to admit he had a problem. He was embarrassed about it and thataposs just not right. It shouldnapost be like that. After hearing evidence that Lee had been drinking in the days before his death, senior coroner Alan Walsh also read out a message he had sent to his sister Katie that morning. It simply read: My le is spiralling out of control. John McElroy, Sharonaposs eldest son, thinks Leeaposs mental health problems began when he found out his brother had killed himself. We think that was the catalyst and the start of Leeaposs problems, I think it had a massive impact on him, he said Thereaposs  years between me and Lee and thataposs a big gap. I think for him it was a bit like having two separate families. But Lee and Karl were closer in age than me and when he lost Karl, Lee started to struggle. Lee, who loved going for walks and spending time outdoors, was working as a delivery driver when he died but had spent his le in a iety of dferent roles.  John said: Lee was  when his brother died. We didnapost think he had depression at that age but his le wasnapost on the path that he wouldaposve liked. He added: I donapost think thereaposs enough support for young men. Itaposs getting better but thereaposs still a massive stigma around mental health and talking about these things. If youaposre struggling or worried itaposs locked away in the attic and youaposre told to be embarrassed about it. Itaposs getting better now and I think maybe in  years it will be a much better situation for people. When I was at school years agoanyone showed weakness they were ridiculed. Iaposm not sure thataposs the case now but it was then. Following the two horric losses in her le, Sharonaposs youngest child, Katie, has begun to devote much of her time to trying to help other families in a similar situation.She is working to raise money for suicide prevention charity Papyrus and has already generated more than £, in donations for a hike to the top of Scafell Pike."},{"url":null,"title":"pc andrew harpers widow asks","story":"NewsPC Andrew Harpers widow asks PM for retrial after husbands killers cleared of murderLissie Harper wrote an emotional letter to the Prime Minister, Home Secretary and former Home Secretary detailing her battle for justice for husband PC Andrew Harper, who died last yearShareByHenry VaughanJamie Hawkins:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsPC Harper was dragged for more than a mile along country lanes in August last year while responding to a quad bike theft \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Lissie Harper had been married to PC Harper for just a month when he was killed by Henry Long, , Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both , as they tried to steal a quad bike. PC Harper, , was dragged for more than a mile along the country lanes of Berkshire when he became entangled in a tow rope attached to the teenagersapos getaway car. An Old Bailey jury acquitted all three defendants of murder on Friday, instead convicting Cole and Bowers of manslaughter. Long had previously pleaded guilty to the same charge. In an open letter posted on her Facebook page on Tuesday evening, Mrs Harper wrote to Boris Johnson, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Lord Blunkett urging them and others to right such a despicable wrong for our country. She wrote: I implore you to hear my words, see the facts that are laid out before us, and I ask with no expectations other than hope that you might help me to make these changes be considered, to ensure that Andrew is given the retrial that he unquestionably deserves and to see that the justice system in our country is the solid ethical foundation that it rightly should be. Not the joke that so many of us now view it to be. The original trial was abandoned on the day the country went into lockdown in March, while for the retrial Mr Justice Edis ordered extra security measures amid fears of potential juror intimidation.  A female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining  started deliberating on their verdicts after she was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the teenagers in the dock. The defendants hugged each other after the verdicts were ed following more than  hours of deliberations. Speaking outside court, Mrs Harper thanked the police and prosecution who had stood in our corner and fought to make sure these men were made to repent for their barbaric crimes. But she criticised the verdicts in the open letter on Facebook, which has been shared more than , times.

Dubbed the John Travolta dress, it was bought by Historic Royal Palaces for £, last December, but has remained in lockdown for months. The midnight blue velvet gown will now be the star attraction when the princessapos former home Kensington Palace reopens to the public on Thursday. Designed by Victor Edelstein, Princess Diana wore it to a White House Gala in , and was famously swept onto the dancefloor by Travolta. Images of the princess and the Hollywood star twirling made headlines around the world and immortalised the dress in the eyes of the public. The actor later described the experience as being like a fairy tale. Sam Owen, Head of Kensington Palace, said: We are delighted to be welcoming visitors back to the palace again this Thursday. Kensington Palace was built to be enjoyed by hundreds of people and itaposs been sad to see it so quiet over the past couple of months. Myself and the team canapost wait to welcome visitors back again and give them a suitably royal welcome. Weaposve never needed their support more - each visit is an important contribution to help us maintain this wonderful building for generations to come.The gown - which Diana originally spotted in burgundy but asked Edelstein to make in blue - did not reach its reserve price of £, when it went to auction. It had been expected to fetch between £, and £, at the Passion for Fashion sale at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London. But it later sold post-auction for £, to Historic Royal Palaces, a charity which looks after a number of historic buildings including Kensington Palace.

Some temperatures in the low s - not out of the question, we could get the UKaposs highest temperature of the year so far, he added. However, before that, weaposve got some more drab weather to contend with as patchy rain and forceful winds continue to give Britain something of an autumnal feel.

But the hot and fine weather is likely to be isolated, with thunderstorms expected on Friday evening in central and eastern England. The weekend sees a major dip in temperatures - as low as C in parts for the start of August. The Met Officeaposs long range report says: There are some fairly strong signals that unsettled conditions are likely to continue through into the first half of August, with outbreaks of rain and scattered showers affecting all parts of the United Kingdom at times.

Lauren Barton popped down to her local Waitrose last month and picked up the half dozen pack of Clarence Court Braddock Whites Free Range Duck Eggs, for £.. But the -year-old English teacher popped half of the eggs into an incubator she had bought off Amazon to seeshe could hatch a duckling. And to Laurenaposs delight,  days later, one of the eggs in the incubator started to show cracks - and after an intense  hours of hatching, a tiny little duckling popped out. Lauren, from Ipswich, Suffolk, has named the fluffy little chick Darwin - and says it is just like having a dog. She said: Heaposs gorgeous. Heaposs so friendly, he loves us completely. Heaposs like a little dog - heaposs so loyal and just follows us around everywhere, and wants attention all the time. I think he thinks heaposs a human, or weaposre ducks. The box of eggs only cost £., and the incubator cost less than £. It was certainly an experiment, but it was well worth it. Lauren, who teaches at Copleston High School in Ipswich, Suffolk, said she got the idea after reading another news story about someone who had also hatched supermarket eggs recently. She said: No-one in my family thought it was a good idea, because they said ducks are messy and hard work. My partner really didnapost want me to do it. But I loved the idea, so I went ahead and did it.  The incubation was actually quite laborious, itaposs quite intense. The eggs spend a month in the incubator, but you have to turn them three times a day every day, and then you have to mist the eggs towards the end to keep their temperature right. Thereaposs a lot of work involved. Itaposs not like I could go out for the day and leave them to it. Lauren bought the smallest size of incubator she could find - meaning she could only fit three of the eggs into it, and had to throw away the other three eggs. She said: I was shocked when I saw that two of the three I put into the incubator were viable and were growing. We werenapost really expecting it to work.  And even though Darwin was the only duck that made it in the end, Lauren said that she had to wait a long  hours for him to emerge - and that she didnapost think he was going to survive. She said: On the day that he started cracking, it was my last day of teaching at school before the summer, and I was meant to be going out the next night with some of the other staff. But when he still hadnapost come out the next day, I had to text them to say I didnapost think I was going to be able to make it out. I did go in the end, but I had to cut it short to go home and check on the duckling.

The manaposs we revealed how a lady in a black face mask kept calling us idiots and flipping me off before she unleashed the mace. Ash OaposBrien shared video and pictures of the attacker - taken by a witness - who pounced as she and her husband Jarrett Kelley tucked-in to some food while out walking their pug dog in the Dusty Rhodes Dog Park in San Diego, Calornia, on Saturday.It is currently law in Calornia to wear a face mask to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but Ash wrote on Facebook that she and Jarrett were not wearing masks because they were eating.She wrote: This is my husband getting maced by a random old lady. We had our three-month-old pug with us. We were just sitting down eating lunch and minding our own business. We were not wearing masks because we were eating. You can’t wear a mask and eat at the same time. She kept calling us idiots and flipping me off. Then she started saying more stuff and I told her to leave the park and stop harassing us. She then came right up to our table wear we were eating, pointed the mace at me first and got a little on me, and then my husband stepped in and took the entire can. The video shows her husband being hit by the mace, leaving him reeling, while Ash can be heard crying. Another woman, witnessing what is happening, asks the woman what are you doing  and adds “You cannot be serious. You just maced him.”  The pepper-spraying woman then walks off to her car. Ash said in her Facebook post: Thank god for the bystander that took this video because we are going to the police now to press charges. I am sharing this because people need to watch out for this lady in San Diego. Please share to spread awareness.  That is me crying hysterically in the background because my innocent husband just got maced for no reason. We want justice. Ash has reported the woman to the police and would like her jailed. In a later Facebook post, Ash adds: A lot of people are saying he should’ve gotten physical with the KAREN butwe did the entire case would’ve gone in her favour.  My husband is a very mature man and I wouldn’t have wanted him to handle the situation any other way. All we want from this, is for her to get arrested so she can’t put any people or animals at risk. We are not looking for money or anything like that. We just want this woman in jail.

For years, Japanaposs north coast had been the site of the disturbing phenomenon, with rickety fishing vessels arriving more than ,km from where they set out. In  the numbers were unprecedented with more than  damaged boats landing, containing a total of  bodies, compared to  vessels the year before.Some have speculated the weather that year was to blame and that North Koreaaposs aging fishing population had something to do with the problem. But a study by non-profit Global Fishing Watch and published today in journal Science Advances has been able to shed some light on the matter.Researchers used satellite technologies to analyse marine traffic in northeast Asia in  and , and discovered hundreds of dark fishing fleets - believed to be Chinese - have been operating in North Korean waters - apparently illegally. This meant ushering out North Korean boats and forcing them on ill-advised ventures into Russian and Japanese waters, poorly equipped for long distance travel.  For foreigners, fishing in waters off the North Korean coast or trading fish caught there internationally is against the law - but it doesnapost appear to have deterred the huge swathes of rogue ships, according to the report. The paperaposs authors estimate in  and  alone these ships caught more than , metric tons of Pacic flying squid, a particularly valuable seafood - worth £ million. Jaeyoon Park, a senior data scientist at Global Fishing Watch and co-lead author of the study, said: It is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by vessels originating from one country operating in another nationaposs waters. Another author, Jungsam Lee, said the North Korean vesselsapos decision to try their luck in distant foreign waters would have proved catastrophic for many of the fisherman.  It is too dangerous for them to work in the same waters as the Chinese trawlers, he explained. Thataposs why theyaposre pushed to work in Russian and Japanese waters and that explains why some of North Koreaaposs damaged vessels showed up on the beaches of Japan. Northeast Asiaaposs waters are some of the most contested seas in the world, but fish stocks are in dramatic decline. The Pacic flying squid stocks have dropped  per cent in South Korean waters and  per cent Japanese waters since , according to Global Fishing Watch.

And the schools have gone even further, by placing a ban on scarves or bandanas being used as face coverings. Pupils have been told they can pick up a face mask which conforms to the strict rules from the reception at the schoolthey do not have one which is appropriate. And pupils exempted from the rules due to a medical reason, are asked to tell their school leader. The policy states: Face masks must be worn to and from school and while on site. The video was posted on YouTube but has now been deleted.  School principal Avril Howard said it had standards and protocols in regards to the wearing of masks. But parents in the community blasted the policy as ridiculous. Objections included the fact the masks are often hard to come by in any colour, let alone specic colours, News reports.Another Melbourne school, Lowther Hall Anglican Grammar in Essendon, has also taken up the policy. It is reported that a company which supplies unorm the school has made up some earslbrae blue masks specially for their client.

That’s a good thing.”United#s starting line-up was: Siegrist, L Smith, Powers, Connolly, Pawlett, C Smith, Robson, Butcher, Harkes, Shankland and Mochrie.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

the proposals on behalf of Gatsby Aberdeen Ltd with Aberdeenshire Council for the former Homebase site at Portlethen in May.They set their vision to split the unit into two dferent stores with one being home to a food retailer and the other would be a iety retailer.Work would include creating  disabled parking bays, and  for parent and child parking.Now planning chiefs at Aberdeenshire Council have given their support to the project despite an objection from a nearby slaughterhouse.But a report by the local authority said environmental health officials had no issues with the plans.It said: #While representation has been made by the adjacent business premise, the nature of the works proposed are in most part minor elevational alterations to the existing building, as opposed to a complete new build structure in#As such, it is expected that the timescale for the specied workswould actually be for a  short timeframe, and notwithstanding, the developer would have to accord with general accepted working practices for construction hours.#Through consultation with environmental health, they have confirmed that they have no objection to the proposals and that the proposed development is in keeping with the previous use of the unit when it operated as Homebase.#The report concluded the changes to the former hardware store were #minor works# and would not have a major impact on the

in -, and failed to use £ million of borrowing capacity. ​Instead of demanding further borrowing powers and more funding from the UK Government, the separatists should learn to use the resources they already have.With such colossal mismanagement, it#s no surprise that even senior SNP advisor Andrew Wilson has stated that Scotland is set to be the worst performing economy in the developed world. Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"hidden-disability-face-mask-exemptions-card----can-get-one","story":"FACE coverings became mandatory in Scotlands shopson July  -

You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy,

east end of High Street, it would be ldquoconverting part of Elcho Green to a temporary car park to support access to the High Street area.It stated that ldquofollowing a meeting with local traders, North Berwick CommunityCouncil and North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, agreement has been reached to introduce a number of temporary measures in the town ndash but both the community council and area partnership told the Courier they had not given backing to the Elcho Green changes.The councilrsquos own timetable had Elcho Green car park opening last Friday .An online petition, West Bay not Parking Bay, to ldquoprotect stunning and iconic West Bay in North Berwick, was launched by resident Sarah Russell and had attracted more than , signatures in less than a week.It said: ldquoEast Lothian Council have announced plans to turn Elcho Green into a longstay car park.ldquoWhilst the council state that this is a temporary measure to comply with their Covid Spaces for People initiative, it is greatly feared that this will, in fact, lead to a permanent car park in the most iconic seafront location in East Lothian.\"North Berwick residents and visitors alike will be robbed of the very essence of this beautul recreational space that personies this famous conservation area seafront.ldquoTemporary or otherwise, Elcho Green is not the correct location for any car parking and we would urge you to help us stop this environmental catastrophe.Among those supporting the campaign was world-famous golfer and North Berwick resident Catriona Matthew, captain of Europersquos winning Solheim Cup team.The Courier has been swamped with letters and emails against the plans .The scheme was described as ldquoindefensible and ldquoundemocratic vandalism by some residents, while many asked why there had not been specic consultation on the plan and highlighted that the land had been gted to the town by the late Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple for recreational use in .On Monday, East Lothian Council released a statement that it was placing the ldquoElcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.It is the second time in a month that the councilrsquos plans to transform town centres have hit the buffers.Earlier in July, proposals to suspend parking in town centres were put ldquoon hold after traders and residents in Haddington reacted with anger as cones and parking suspension signs were put up overnight, sparking widespread concern.In Mondayrsquos statement, Councillor Norman Hampshire , environment spokesperson, said: ldquoEast Lothian Council has successfully implemented a number of physical distancing measures on North Berwick High Street to support the need for safe access to the town centre and economic recovery.ldquoA further support for Spaces for People was a proposal to utilise a small part of Elcho Green in North Berwick as a temporary car park.ldquoThe benefit of this would have been a reduction in the number of vehicles circling and queuing for parking spaces, enhanced safety for pedestrians and cyclists within the town centre, and improved air quality.ldquoEast Lothian Council is a listening authority and we are aware of the ious perspectives being raised within the North Berwick community.ldquoAs such, we intend to place the Elcho Green temporary car parking proposal on hold to allow us a further opportunity to engage and consult.\"This delay will also enable us to monitor the impact of increased traffic as a result of visitors and to assess the effectiveness of measures introduced.Councillor Stuart Currie, SNP Group leader, said that recent u-turns were down to a ldquolack of political leadership within the Labour administration.He said he received more than  emails objecting to the Elcho Green plans.He called for a report on the Spaces for People plans, and in particular parking proposals in North Berwick, to be put before a meeting of elected council group leaders in two weeksrsquo time for approval.Under emergency Covid- procedures, normal council business is currently suspended and decisions are taken at monthly meetings of the group leaders and council chief executive.He said: ldquoThe decision must be approved by councillors at the leadersrsquo group meeting and it should be open and transparent and open to the press.Mr Hampshire accused Mr Currie of ldquoplaying politics in ldquoan emergency situation.ldquoWe have allowed him to take part in the meetings with officers at every point during the discussions, said Mr Hampshire.ldquoI have got to say the Conservative Group have been fully behind what we are doing.\"For the SNP to try to play politics in a situation where their own Government is instructing local authorities to create spaces in town centres is unbelievable.Conservative councillor Craig Hoy called on the administration to ldquotake notice of the recent problems caused by parking proposals.He said the Scottish Government had failed to give councils enough time to push through emergency Covid measures in town centres.Councillor Hoy said: \"Scottish Councils are operating under huge pressure with limited resources, but that does not remove the need for them to consult fully and communicate clearly on big issues which impact our communities.\"I hope East Lothian Council and the Labour administration will take notice of the recent problems in North Berwick and fully engage with stakeholders.\"Hilary Smith, chair of North Berwick Coastal Area Partnership, stressed that the area partnership had not attended any meeting regarding Covid- plans for the town or given its approval to the plans.North Berwick Community Council said it had not discussed Elcho Green prior to its meeting on Tuesday.East Lothian Council received pound.million from Scottish Government funding for Spaces for People projects to make social distancing easier in town centres and encourage people toto them safely.The council launched a consultation in May, asking people for their county-wide views.It attracted , contributions and more than  comments, including more than  from the North Berwick area.But North Berwick residents have not been asked their specic views on Elcho Green car parking.The council said it had given consideration to parking availability at a number of sites in North Berwick.In response to questions from the Courier, the council said: ldquoThe high school and sports centre are both due to re-open in coming weeks so were unsuitable to use.ldquoAn area of Elcho Green is considered suitable to take traffic arriving from the west to park for people visiting the town to intercept the flow of traffic and stop vehicles circulating through the town unnecessarily searching for parking spaces and generating additional traffic pollution.ldquoIt also seemed reasonable considering the area of land is used annually for Fringe by the Sea events.\"A maximum of  places had been identied for use as a potential temporary car park which is not part of the Spaces for People grant but provided as part of the

I dedicated June to visiting dferent local sites to watch the kingfisher ndash which you may remember from my previous article ndash a family of wrens and the brown hares.One evening, as I was uploading my photographs on to social media and searching through the pages, I came across a few images of a bird that every birder wanted to see since its influx to the UK was published. It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes.

they do not want to take either the health or financial risk of booking one. So the lure of the staycation has become attractive to many for the first time and, luckily being in East Lothian, we have plenty to keep us entertained.We have a huge number of attractions, whether that be our numerous world-renowned golf courses, the nationally recognised National Museum of Flight and Scottish Seabird Centre in North Berwick, or as one of Scotlandrsquos premier coastal destinations for food and drink.What always interests me is that there is so much available that not everyone knows everything. I am often struck by people not knowing some of the sites in my ward of Preston, Seton and Gosford. Therefore, I thought this week I would take the opportunity to plug them and encourage you to visit us.To start in the west of the ward in Prestonpans exists the Prestonpans Murals Trail, which is made of over  pieces of art, and depicts the townrsquos culture and history.This includes murals on its witch hunts, industrial past, the influence on famous conservationist John Muirrsquos early le, and relation with migration both to and from Scotland ndash well worth a few hoursrsquo walk around the town.Also in the town there is the unappreciated Preston Tower, a structure with parts still standing from the th century. It is a one-of-a-kind building, with dferent parts and floors having been added over the years and other bits destroyed since it was first built.Currently it isnrsquot open but Prestonpans Community Council has been pushing to get it in a fit state so that the people of Prestonpans can truly benefit from this one-of-a-kind building.Moving east into Cockenzie and Port Seton, next to the harbour is the  Waggonway Museum. It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century. It is now home to a brilliant wee cafe and numerous craft businesses well worth a visit.In between Longniddry and Port Seton sits Seton Colligate Church, considered ldquoone of the finest medieval collegiate churches in Scotland. It was built in the late s by landowner Lord Seton so the community of priests could pray for his familyrsquos salvation.Finally on the coast there is Longniddry Bents, East Lothian largest tourist attraction. It is a beautul stretch of coastline home to a large iety of wildle, including many types of birds, voles and seals.Soyou are having a staycation this summer, visit the Preston, Seton and Gosford area and, whilst here, support our local cafes, shops, restaurants and pubs."},{"url":null,"title":"letter-it-act-vandalism","story":"Today we are faced with a proposal to turn part of one of these beautul natural sites, in a designated conservation area, into an unsightly car park.Having been born and brought up in North Berwick and able to take advantage of the foresight of our forefathers, I was astonished to find not only that the proposal had been lsquoapprovedrsquo, but that it had been made at all.

councilrsquos Local Review Body overturned the refusal on appeal after councillors ruled the proposal was better than leaving the building to fall into disrepair.And they questioned whether the design of the new property, which featured extensive glass frontage to let in light, would, in fact, make the amenity more acceptable.Planning officers had estimated the new one-bedroom property would offer just nine square metres of living space in the proposed kitchen living area.The review body was told that there was no set standard for amenity and outlook when it came to conversions like the one put forward for the building, on the townrsquos Lamer Street.Instead, Leigh Taylor, council planning advisor, said it was down to the inidual officer involved.He said: ldquoThere is no exact standard, it

the rear for amenity. The site is also opposite the beach.Councillor Sue Kempson, review body member and ward councillor, said she believedit was important to see the building used for a new purpose and did not feel the lack of amenity was a problem, adding: ldquoNot everyone wants a garden.Fellow member Councillor Neil Gilbert agreed, adding: ldquoA building like this, the longer it is left the more it deteriorates. It has to find a new purpose.Councillor Norman Hampshire, review body chairman and ward member, also upheld the appeal.He said: ldquoIt has to have another use either as commercial or residential and I think residential is a good fit for this building.

But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"books-peter-geoghegan-dark-money-reshaped-political-agenda","story":"Peter GeogheganHead of Zeus, pound.Review by Fiona RintoulON reaching chapter four of Peter Geogheganrsquos meticulously researched and highly readable new book Democracy for Sale: Dark Money and Dirty Politics, I emitted a small scream of ldquoNo!. Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation.

It is the number of wealth in Hinduism, the number of gates of heaven in Islam, and is a lucky number in China and Japan, also because of its mythological connection to prosperity.And today I am going to make my case for the power of eight for Scottish unionism, a bedraggled concept which appears in slow decline. There should be no inevitability about this, however, and indeed I would suggest that they may find their own form of prosperity should they follow these eight simple rules. - Understand where you are and why yoursquore thereIn considering the narrative of last weekrsquos visit by Boris Johnson, which was presumably pre-briefed by Downing Street, one would be forgiven for thinking that nobody in the Prime Ministerrsquos operation has seen any of the news which has emanated from Scotland over the last  years. To suddenly be plunged into apparent lsquopanic modersquo is to misunderstand unionismrsquos position. Unionismrsquos deficit has been coming for years. Indeed, far from being a resounding victory, it looks increasingly as though the  referendum simply came early enough on the x-axis for unionism to survive. But unionism is not in the doldrums because of any irresistible pull-factor inherent in Scottish nationalism rather, there is a signicant push-factor involved. Unionism is stuck in an unappealing, perpetual panic, reacting to everything, offering nothing positive. SNP wins an election unionists create the Calman Commission. Yes almost wins the referendum unionists create the Vow and the Smith Commission. It is a humiliating lack of thought, understanding and planning all rolled into one. - Be less emotionalI appreciate I am in the minority as someone who does not feel particularly nationalistic or patriotic, either towards Britain or Scotland, however unionistsrsquo emotional, sometimes rather hysterical, obsession with lsquoour precious unionrsquo is preventing sensible decision making. Too many unionists exude the air of people who are confused and embittered that the general population doesnrsquot share their unrequited love. A more clinical approach, which is much more characteristic of nationalist leaders, would create the space for far more sensible decision making.: Nicola Sturgeon facing questions over her knowledge of Alex Salmond probe - Stop visiting Scotland to lsquosave the unionrsquoThis is a foolish endeavour for a number of reasons, but most obviously it underlines the fact that members of the Cabinet seldom come to Scotland, a part of the UK which they have just as much right to visit as anywhere , including England. Cabinet visits would be far less controversial, more normal indeed,they happened more often. - Stop talking Scotland downUnionists think this is a nationalist trope, but they are wrong: the tone of unionist communications is counterproductive and corrosive. Coronavirus has turbocharged the temptation to revert to this approach, and the notion that an independent Scotland could not have afforded furlough and a range of other measures is now a centrepiece of unionist messaging. It is, of course, nonsense, and while an independent Scotland would inevitably face uncertainty in its initial years, there is no reason to expect that it would not rapidly develop the ideological maturity to create a wealthy country.:Michael Gove not distracted by independence support surge as devolution key to union case - Stop doing the nationalistsrsquo work for themA great deal of unionist action plays directly into the hands of nationalism. Because of the raw emotion , Unionists tend to define victory as denying the SNP something that it wants, without understanding that this plays perfectly into the nationalist narrative. The prime example of this, which is coming at unionists like a herd of buffalo, is the current policy of saying no to a second independence referendum, evenit is secured with a majority of seats, perhaps even votes, on a clear manesto commitment. Unionists may see this as a clever tactic which puts Nicola Sturgeon in a hole, but in the medium- to long-term it is an appalling strategy which pushes soft unionists, dismayed at the denial of democracy, to the other side. - Get Brexit doneBy default, we consider Brexit to push Scotland towards independence, but in fact a swt Brexit with a reasonable deal has a good chance of becoming a positive for unionism. I voted Remain, but despite this I expect the outcome of Brexit to be signicantly less damaging than doomsayers predict, and this, coated in the toxic prospect of a customs border between Scotland and England should an independent Scotland rejoin the EUrsquos Customs Union, may well flip the Brexit issue from the nationalist column to the unionist one. - Do moreFor a group of people who are so ostensibly passionate about keeping Scotland in the union, the UK Government is prone to leaving the field of play empty for the Scottish Government to roam free. Scottish Secretary Alister Jack and his team appear to understand the pitfalls of this better than their predecessors, but much of the damage has been done. Unionists should be bolder about planting their flag on Scottish turf, including in devolved competencies, especially when theyrsquove paid for the flagpole ndash a practice which is considered normal in federal countries. - Finally, itrsquos time for a New UnionUnionists are always chasing the curve reacting, panicking, misstepping. They need to make a calm, clinical analysis of where the people of the nations of the UK want to be in  years, and create a positive, proactive vision of a New Unionism which takes us all there. It is, in my view, highly likely to involve both more muscular unionismas well as an enhancement of devolved powers. They can call this federalism, or any other of the myriad terms people use for it ndash it is what it is. But whatever they call it, unionists should understand that New Unionism has a real chance of appealing to many of the soft centrists whom they have pushed towards nationalism.

Its basic constituents are cheap and abundant in the UK, but the benefit for the environment is that making lsquonewrsquo product from glass culletrequires far less energy. So bottle banks prolerated everywhere, often placed at supermarkets to attract families when they came for the weekly shop.When kerbside recycling was introduced two decades ago, performances shot upbut it should be recognised that using aluminium and steel cans for beverages, and the pubs moving away from bottled mixers to aerated cordials meant fewer glass bottles being used in recent years.The Scottish Government has recently spent a lot of time and money promoting a proposed Deposit Return Scheme, designed to recover more plastic containers with an additional benefit of ldquoreducing litter .Every beverage containerwill carry a p deposit. This deposit will only be reclaimable at ldquoauthorised refunders so not every shop selling beverages will also refund deposits. If you live some distance away from an authorised refunder, it might not always be convenient for you to recover the deposits. Some commentators suspect that those who depend on public transport to get around might simply not bother, but therersquos always the safety net that the more responsible householders will continue to use their kerbside recycling services for glass, plastic and aluminium containers. That, however, doesnrsquot address the issue of these customers having paid an extra p container that they might not always be able to redeem.But the devil is in the detail: the deposit is to be p irrespective of capacity: a multipack of  cans will carry a deposit six times that of the equivalent volume available in larger plastic bottles. The plastic industry has estimated that this approach will actually result in more plastic bottles being used, the very opposite of what the scheme is designed to achieve. Germany has already implemented a similar scheme and reports a % increase in plastic bottle consumption.Eventhe proposed scheme does work, there seems to have been little thought given to what will happen to the ed beverage containers . It used to be estimated that the humble milk bottle made between five and seven trips to our homes in its letime.

Irsquod just learnt that ldquothe most blatant example of dark money in recent electoral politics can be traced to the south Glasgow suburb of Clarkston.The poundk-plus that the Democratic Unionist Partyspent on pro-Brexit advertising in the run up to the June  referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the European Union ndash not in Northern Ireland but Great Britain ndash was donated by an obscure body named the Constitutional Research Council . Its only named director was Richard Cook, a multiply-failed Tory candidate of Clarkston parish.This incident is totemic of the tawdry tale of secretive donors and anonymous propaganda that Geoghegan, investigations editor at independent media  openDemocracy and founder of the award-winning investigative website The Ferret, painstakingly weaves in Democracy for Sale. There are a few diamond mines and Russian ambassadors, itrsquos true, but in the main this story unfolds in unstimulating locales and features compromised mediocrities such as Cook.His business interests are nearly as convoluted as those of Arron Banks, one of the self-proclaimed ldquoBad Boys of Brexit. Drawing on the resources of a miasma of offshore companies, Banks bankrolled the belligerent, anti-immigration Leave.EU campaign with the ldquobiggest donation in British political history.The National Crime Agency investigated Banksrsquo pound.m donation to anti-EU causes amid mounting speculation about the source of the funds, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. Banks hailed the ruling as vindication of his Brexit campaign, but others saw it as ldquotacit acceptance that companies in offshore jurisdictions could underwrite political donations.The campaign for Brexit mingled such offshore money with obscure onshore funding. The CRCrsquos donation to the DUP encapsulates the problem. The CRC is an unincorporated association, not subject to the normal disclosure requirements that an incorporated company must meet. According to Geoghegan, unincorporated associations are ldquoblack boxes that can be set up for the sole purpose of funnelling money to political campaigns, with little or no transparency.The influential European Research Groupis also an unincorporated association. Geoghegan shows how the ERG, a party within a party that ldquobrought down a Conservative prime minister and called the tune on Brexit, was able to trouser around pound, in taxpayer money between  and  ldquothanks to a little-used Westminster convention. Another scream moment.The tale of how dark money reshaped the political agenda in the UK and beyond pullulates with such dim-lit legal entities. The same people and companies ndash Cambridge Analytica, Dominic Cummings, Nigel Farage ndash keep reappearing from the mists of an opaque complex of vested interests.Geoghegan claries that he does not believe Brexit was ldquosome grand conspiracy. The British state and the political and business establishment were behind Remain. Instead, he says, the referendum and its aftermath reveal something more fundamental and systemic: ldquoa broken political system that is ripe for exploitation.Arguably, the groundwork for Brexit ndash and for Donald Trump and Boris Johnsonrsquos victories at the ballot box ndash was laid by another brand of unaccountable entity: the think tank. In theory, think tanks do research and publish research papers in practice, says Geoghegan, ldquoWords like lsquoinstitutersquo and lsquocentrersquo give an appearance of academic rigour to what is essentially paid-for lobbying.In the book, Geoghegan illuminates a network of libertarian think tanks that have sought to shunt the political agenda to the right in the UK and the US. Of course, there are left-leaning think tanks too, but, as Geoghegan notes, they are generally more transparent about their funding, as they rely on public money and donations from trusts.Anonymous funding makes think tanks the ideal vehicle for business interests to influence government policy beneath the radar. Geoghegan shows how a ldquotiny group of American plutocrats invested billions in think tanks, universities and election campaigns over the last four decades. ldquoBefore this methodical and precisely targeted spending spree, libertarians had been largely thought of as cranks, he writes. ldquoAfterwards, the limited space within which policies are created and publicly discussed was filled with proposals that they wanted.The ldquogrande dame of libertarian think tanks is the Institute for Economic Affairsin London. Geoghegan reveals how the IEArsquos ldquosunny analysis about Brexit and unprecedented access to ministers helped determine the UK governmentrsquos course after the referendum. The IEA also worked to promote the idea of the Anglosphere in the UK ndash a union of English-speaking people as a bulwark against Brussels bureaucrats first mooted by Margaret Thatcher in .Democracy for Sale appears just as the UK government publishes its long-awaited report into alleged Russian interference in UK politics. Geoghegan touches on Russian influence in the UK and beyond, but the bulk of the dark money and misinformation that he documents sits much closer to home.ldquoHiding in plain sight is a phrase that recurs throughout this book. The ultimate source of the money donated to the DUP by the CRC in the run-up to the EU referendum was protected not by cloak-and-dagger Brexiteers but by Northern Irish legislation. Subsequent Electoral Commission inquiries into the donation proved toothless. ldquoThe system is broken, and nobody intends to fix it, transparency activist Tamasin Cave tells Geoghegan.In ldquothe digital Wild West, accountability is in even shorter supply. Geoghegan conjures a blizzard of examples of the disturbing ways in which digital campaigning can be used to undermine democratic mechanisms, from targeted messaging to voter suppression.In this shadowy world, truth is the first casualty.

Circular debate on the same issues is the inevitable outcome of a permanent but unresolved constitutional ide.Meanwhile, bigger issues of the European green deal, the massive new Covid recovery fund and future EU budget deal, the EUrsquos failures on the refugees and migration front, its populist and rule of law challenges, are all rather far from most Scottish political and policy debate. Beyond the EU, the current state of global power politics was parlous and deeply troubling even before the Covid- crisis. Whether as part of the UK, or as an independent Scotland in the EU, these global challenges need serious debate.And,Scotland does choose independence, then the process of becoming a well-established, mature independent state will take time. Itrsquos not only a question of the transitions from the UK and into the EU but a question of active, long-term state-building.And , contrary to current polls, Scotland chose to stay in the UK, then political time could be used to push for a more positive transformation of the Union rather than the catalogue of destructive errors currently emanating out of London. Resolving the constitutional debate quickly would free up time for such vital issues.But, of course, democratic politics doesnrsquot work that way. Democracy takes time. The UK and Scottish governments will continue their stand-off over another referendum SNP infighting over tactics will doubtless continue and opposition parties will carry on inveighing against independence. And, while the constitutional issue is at the core of Scottish politics, then it will be a politics dominated by a rather inward-looking debate.:BBC Executive Complaints Unit issue ruling over Sarah Smith report on Nicola SturgeonBut the world is in a deeply unstable state and it would behove both sides of the independence ide to spend more time engaging with those wider challenges.Scotlandrsquos politics, given the constitutional ide, is inevitably stuck in a repetitive campaigning state.

Agents have been in court and theyrsquove been able to hear other agents consulting with their clients where.ldquoWe are concerned that in some cases this is causing a breach of EHRC rights. Clients are entitled to consult with a solicitor and that consultation should be confidential. Being able to hear what is going on in court is also part of their right to a fair trial - they should be able to effectively participate and, in some cases, they havenrsquot been able to do that.The custody courts deal with people who have been arrested and are being held by Police Scotland.At present, most cases involve the accused being taken to court by security staff, but virtual hearings have been brought in to deal with people with suspected or confirmed Covid-.This has now been expanded to a handful of non-covid cases and the court service aims to roll it out so that virtual custody hearings become the ldquonorm in Scotland.However, lawyers believe there needs to be investment in infrastructure and technology before this can happen.Stuart Murray, president of Aberdeen Bar Association, said: ldquoWhat theyrsquove done in these cases is removed face to face contact with a solicitor and substituted it with a remote access conversation when the technology just isnrsquot up to scratch.ldquoThe video link we were supposed to use rarely worked, and on occasion it can take as many as  phone calls to get through to the police station in order to speak to a client before they appeared in court. And then on the occasions when the link did work, most clients couldnrsquot hear what was going on in court. The technology just isnrsquot fit for purpose.He added that virtual custody hearings have now been stopped at Aberdeen.Miss McPartlin added that the countryrsquos bar associations may join together to insist all non-covid accused are brought to courtthe technological problems continue.The Law Society said its survey highlighted the ldquosignicant issues faced by solicitors and their clients.Society president Amanda Millar said: ldquoThere is a role for technology in the justice system and there may be some potential advantages to virtual custody courts beyond the immediate need for Covid- safety measures.ldquoHowever the survey findings have highlighted a range of practical problems arising from the pilot. These will have to be addressed before there can be any plans for a further roll out.She added that the technology involved must provide ldquosecure, confidential communication between a solicitor and their client, otherwise there may be potential challenges.David Fraser, SCTS Chief Operations Officer, said: ldquoWe welcome the feedback from the Law Society based on solicitorsrsquo experiences. The Law Society, through the national working group, are involved in the current arrangements for a pilot to be conducted in Glasgow Sherf Court.ldquoThis pilot will refine the standards required for virtual custody hearings, and takes account of the matters raised in the Law Society report. The pilot will be evaluated before any decision is taken on a wider roll-out."},{"url":null,"title":"frustration-among-fitness-centres-gym-bosses-feel-left-behind-urge-scottish-government-set-reopening-date","story":"Independently run studios are calling for clarication from the Scottish Government and are fearful for the future of their businesses the longer closures are in place.Their calls came after Scots entrepreneur and former Dragons Den Duncan Bannatyne urged the First Minister to set a reopening date.As reported exclusively in The Herald, in a letter sent to Nicola Sturgeon and Health Secretary Jeane Freeman, Mr Bannatyne said: ldquoWe have in excess of  people working in our Scottish Clubs and almost , members, making a vital contribution to the local economies.

In April, when the country was in full lockdown, sales dropped by % and lost firms around poundm. The next month sales decreased by % and in June they were down by %. In March, when lockdown was introduced, sales fell by %.David Lonsdale, Director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said the absence of office workers, students and tourists will continue to affect shops across the country.He explained: ldquoThese figures are stark and show that retail sales crumbled over the first four months of the pandemic.ldquoNot all retail sub-sectors were impacted equally, with fashion, clothing and footwear faring particularly poorly.ldquoShops and retail jobs depend on the ongoing patronage of the public and whilst the situation is gradually improving, it remains particularly acute in our city centres where stores are suffering huge drops in footfall.ldquoAny prolonged absence of office workers, students and tourists from Scotlandrsquos city centres will be hugely challenging for retail and hospitality businesses who rely on their custom, and who often already face high property costs.ldquoThis will have consequences for jobs, vacant premises, and tax revenues.In Westminster, the Business committee chairman Darren Jones MP has written to Alok Sharma, the businesses minister urging him to \"plug the gap\" in support for those ineligible for other schemes, citing evidence from another committee that around one million people in the UK had missed out.Crucially the committee has recommended extra support for sectors affected particularly badly from the pandemic, suggesting the Government \"review\" sectors \"suffering from acute problems resulting from social distancing and other health and safety measures with a view to providing additional support.\"Mr Jones said: \"Witnesses from a number of sectors, such as retail, the creative industries and manufacturing expressed concern that there would be increasing redundancies from August. The restrictions on live performances by actors and musicians, for example, has had a profound affect on the livelihoods of thousands across the UK. The shutdown of the aviation and aerospace sector will clearly have a longer-term impact compared to other sectors. We know that even with the CJRS [Coronavirus job retention scheme] and the other support packages provided by the Government that these sectors in particular have already suffered signicant job losses.\"The committee has detailed concerns over exploitation of workers during the coronavirus period, citing examples where staff have been forced to work in environments they do not consider safe, and pregnant women being asked to go off sick rather than take furlough leave prior to their maternity leave starting.The MP explained: \"We heard that pregnant women who had not yet gone on maternity leave were being unfairly treated. This included: pregnant women: being put on sick pay rather than being furloughed, which affected their statutory maternity benefit entitlement being made redundant before going on maternity leave and being pressurised into working in unsafe working environments. Similarly, as the lockdown has been lted, pregnant women have found that they are being encouraged toto unsafe workplaces and are still being treated unfairly.\"SNP Shadow Chancellor Alison Thewliss MP said the governments plans to end the furlough scheme in October were \"premature and reckless\",She said: \" In just under a weekrsquos time, the Tory government will plough ahead with its premature and reckless plans to cut back support through the Job Retention Scheme ndash despite warnings that this could lead to a jobs bloodbath.\"If the Chancellor is serious about protecting jobs and businesses, and ensuring a strong economic recovery, then he must strengthen and extend the furlough schemes into  ndash including closing the gaps that see seasonal workers, freelancers, self-employed people, and others getting little to no help during this unprecedented crisis.ldquoFailing to do so could lead to redundancies on a level not seen since the s and force many more businesses to pull down their shutters for good.\"Jamie Stone, Lib Dem MP, said it should not be on employers to support freelance workers, after the BBC announced that it would offer financial support to  freelancers they regularly employ.Mr Stone, who chairs the crossparty parliamentary group fighting for people excluded from government schemes, said: \"Freelancers are of immeasurable valuable to our arts and screen sectors.ldquoMillions of people across the UK have been left in bleak situations with no income and no support throughout the pandemic. Many of these people are freelancers and still face real financial hardship.ldquoThis should never have been left to inidual employers to cover the gaps in the Governmentrsquos schemes.

We re now looking to the Scottish Government and VisitScotland to implement national and local campaigns to allay anxiety among local Highland communities and deliver a positive, uplting message as we take safe, measured steps to emerge from lockdown.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative. It#s dficult, but we have to err by the side of caution.#Mr Dickson said that he understood that there would be an element of anxiety around this new possible case, and advised that all those who have come into signicant contact with the inidual in question will be contacted and asked to self-isolate for  days. If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I#m absolutely gutted.#The  year-old added: #I was on the top floor where the fire had started. Just as I was approaching my bedroom door I could hear the night porter running up and down shouting to please evacuate.#Mr Arbuckle described watching a firefighter running down the stairs of the building following an initial inspection.#We were just watching them working and getting prepared, and we were thinking #this is real now.##As we looked up to the centre of the Moorfield, that#s when flames started bursting out of the roof. We saw big, blue flames.#He said staff were eventually taken by bus to to stay at Sella Ness # the very accommodation which has been at the centre of controversy over the Moorfield#s closure.As well as having lost his belongings inside the building, Mr Arbuckle also fears he may well have lost his car # parked, as it was, outside the back of the building.#We#ve not been allowed near it because of the thickness of the smoke,# he said. #I#m not holding out any hope.##Everything I own has gone. I#ve not got a job any more -all my documents, my flash drive, I#m having to restart everything.

Things were getting hotter and hotter.#He also said blue flames began to appear, a sign # he added # that gas cylinders were catching fire inside the building.#We were escorted to an ambulance area, and the locals came out and started giving us blankets. Two buses pulled up and we were sent to Sella Ness, which was a bit of a bitter pill.#Nearby resident Georgia Smith, who lives around  yards from the scene, said signs first emerged of something wrong when her house began losing water pressure.#My dad woke up and looked out the window,# she said. #I heard, #the hotel#s on fire#. I looked out and saw a giant ball of fire. The whole roof was ablaze.#There were a lot of people down there. We watched as the workers all came out and went on the coaches and got shipped to Sella Ness.#Like many residents, Ms Smith was left shocked by the incident # not least because it took place almost exactly a year after an explosion ripped through a house in the area, resulting in the death of Peggy Grfiths.Alison Smith lives in Ockragarth, where that incident took place.#It#s a year on Thursday since Peggy#s house exploded and the poor woman passed away,# the  year-old said.Friend Maria Wishart of Lingapund added: #We could hear the firefighters and the smoke was going right across the voe.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

However, the Department for Communitieswill undertake a ‘full marketing’ exercise in the months ahead and said it will decide on the ‘most appropriate’ project to regenerate the site. Last February, the Trust entered a twelve-month agreement with site owner the DfC to enable the Trust to further develop the proposal of locating a new Cityside Health and Care Centre at Fort George. During that time no further marketing of Fort George took place.

In this respect both DfC and the Trust remain in regular contact in order to review progress.” googletag.cmd.push The DfC said strategic advice will have to be taken on board before a regeneration decision is made.

Father La rises in the morning at around .am for early morning Mass. Less than an hour later, he is under an open sky as birds fly overhead undertaking the Stations in his bare feet leaving solitary footprints where before many soles left their imprint on the earth. Housemartins A station takes around an hour and ten minutes to do and Father La does so under the swooping wings of the Housemartins amidst a backdrop of blooming nature during these calm but drizzly mornings. googletag.cmd.push At am, the boatmen come onto the island. Each day Thomas Gallagher from Ballyshannon, Reece McGrath from Pettigo and Joe Sheeran from Mountcharles arrive on the island and undertake their own work. They leave at pm. “Really, I can hardly remember the last time in my le I was lonely. I am at ease with my own company,” he said. As they leave the island, Father La is well into his day. “I would be hard pushed to find a time when I have been busier. “People are afraid that I am bored but I’m not. The team are exceptionally busy, they have been putting so much work into alternative ways to keep in touch with pilgrims. We have set ourselves to be in outreach mode,” he said. googletag.cmd.push In the evening, Father La goes up to the Basilica for night prayer. “My thoughts are to honour the rhythm of the pilgrimage season,” he says. This year, those affiliated with the island are busy in new and alternate ways. Father La said that many people have been sending petitions to those on the island: “We get a lot of people who send us petitions asking for prayer for this or that,” Father La said. In his prayers, he remains faithful to those people and the heartfelt petitions that they have undertaken to write and to send to the island. Virtuous pilgrimage On the last weekend in June, Father La invited people to do the full pilgrimage with him from wherever they were. It was not a virtual pilgrimage, he said, but a virtuous one and people did fast and pray asthey were on the island. People signed up online to participate. Father La recalls that the pilgrimage was one where they were not blessed with favourable weather. “The rain was horizontal. It was driving rain and constant wind. “It was relentless during the night. On Saturday we got through reasonably well,” he said. Those who participated were bestowed with a certicate which carries the Lough Derg seal and are signed by the prior. All of the certicates had to be sent out by the team to those who participated. A pilgrimage season did not take place on the island in  as result of a dispute with boatmen. However, many more pilgrims came to the island the following year. Pilgrimage path There is now a newly refurbished path on the lake shore of Lough Derg. The path which was recently relaunched would have been used by pilgrims in the medieval times. In the s pilgrims from as far away as Spain, Italy and Hungary used part of this trail as they made their way to what medieval Europe knew of as St Patrick’s Purgatory. Work was being carried out on the path before the pandemic struck and six new boards were designed and ready to go when the lockdown came into effect. There are now six display boards which bring to le the story of the Pilgrim Path and those who walk the path can enjoy stopping to read the boards. Father La said that the ‘full walk’ is around k along the shore road and to Saints Island. “We went to the point where pilgrims used to cross to Saint’s Monastery where they were given hospitality before being brought to Station Island,” he said. People can also take a shorter loop and everyone can do the walk at their own pace. Some people like to do it in soft contemplation and reflection whilst other people like to absorb the surroundings. Many people enjoy taking photographs in the historic and picturesque surroundings. “I led two guided groups on Saturday and Sunday,” he said. Numbers were limited as a result of the Covid- church and State guidelines, those who took part enjoyed it. One-day retreat Father La said that it remains to be seen whether a one-day retreat will take place on the island this year. “It remains to be seen whether we can open for a one-day retreat at this time,” he said. However, a meeting for the matter to be discussed will take place before the end of the week. August  It is expected that Father La will remain on the island until August . Enjoying his own company, reflection and prayer, Father La seems content during this year’s traditional pilgrimage time. He has now become familiar with a goose who comes onto the island to graze in the grass. The goose can be found behind St Mary’s, at times, and when startled will take off honking at great speeds, at times. His presence is one that the reflective priest appreciates. “I am kind of glad for his company. “It is amazing the company that God sends you when you are on your own,” he fondly says.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry Central Library in Foyle Street is one of just five libraries from across the North which were chosen to be part of a pilot scheme to allow customers back in. Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March .

Unfortunately, we have had to take out a lot of seating to allow for social distancing, but this is something we will continue to look at.

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig. Staff will also be carrying out a high level of cleaning in the library. Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people.

Customers can phone their local library during dedicated hours to request books and then arrange a suitable time for a contactless collection, explained Mrs Craig. A customer can view our online catalogue and checka particular book they are interested in is available in their local library, they will then phone and speak with a member of staff who will set it aside and arrange a day and time for them to come in and collect it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He will not be able to call on Shane Lagan after the long-serving defenders retirement. Also gone is Conor McGurk who is still in Australia following the coronavirus pandemic. One man who is back in the fold is Paddy Henry, who has played just one game since the clubs  intermediate championship win. Lavey won the minor football and hurling double last season, but due to the young age profile of the team only minor football skipper Cormac Collins and Ryan McGill have graduated to the senior ranks. googletag.cmd.push He acknowledges the work going on around the club, referencing the U success and a useful U group. “From my point of view, I wish they would come through a bit quicker,” McGarvey jokes. While this weekends opponents have been busy with challenge games, Lavey had just Sundays draw with Carrickmore to help their championship preparation. “Thats all we are going to take,” the Lavey boss stressed, rolling out the names of the dual players in his plans. Fintan Bradley, Dara McPeake, Aidan Toner, the McGill brothers , Liam and Colm Murphy. “I envisage  of our team will be dual players. They wont all start on the football team, but they are aiming to play both,” predicts McGarvey, who leads the management team of Simon Wilson, Ben Dodds, Adie McGill and Mark Hearty. googletag.cmd.push “You are not going to know until you start playing. The boys were glad to get out, but we have a tough schedule because nearly all our players are dual players. We were going four or five times a week and we had to cut it back on them.” On the other side of the coin, Dee Doherty is back in charge of Na Magha, eight years after helping them to an Ulster final where they went down to Bredagh. Galway native Tomaacutes Lally, who has transferred from London club St Gabriels, joins him on the management team. “We are trying to build, like other clubs and counties are doing, to try and progress,” said Doherty, who knows the hurling scene well in his role as physio with Derry senior hurlers. “We want to rise up from being Na Magha, the junior team in Derry. It is a game we are looking forward to, with the incentive of it being your first game at home. We know it is Lavey and we know what we are up against.” It will be a chastening experience for his young side, with many of them going straight in against senior clubs in their first year of adult hurling. Many of his squad work in the retail sector, so balancing shts around training has proved dficult. In a  or  day spell Doherty has juggled challenge games with Donegal sides Burt, St Eunans, Setanta and Buncrana. “We have not been able to get the same team out for any of the games,” said Doherty, who was happy to be working with a group of  plus players. “Of that, nine are first year minors and cant play, but we are thinking down the line to next year and the year after. I have never saw numbers like that at Na Magha in my le,” he said. Having their own base is important, but Doherty points to the efforts of Ciaran McCarron and the coaches who have nurtured the upcoming minor squad. “There is a good group of players there that are interested in playing. You are trying to mix them with the older boys. We want to progress into the intermediate level, thats the aim. “For us to win anything this year, we are going to have to beat one of the senior clubs in the county. If we could win one championship game this year, it would be a result for us and that is the target we set out for ourselves.” It will be a long-term project and continuity will be the key. Home advantage will give Na Magha a familiar surrounding, but Lavey should head back down the Glenshane pass with the points. VERDICT: Lavey RELATED- Sean Leos masterclass not enough to clinch Coleraine win.

Ballyhales fabric was well-tested on an afternoon of drama at Paacuteirc Esler. After the game, a relieved Henry Shefflin told reporters his side was put to the pin of their collar, while Michael McShane believed there was still an All-Ireland in the Slaughtneil side. It wont be this season. The GAA omitted the provincial and All-Ireland club competitions from theirto play roadmap. Michael McShane didnt comment on the decision that would prevents his side from defending their title, should they emerge from Derry. googletag.cmd.push “You are only in the position to question thatyou are county champions,” he stated of the GAAs decision. “Like every other year, we just focus on winning Derry, thats the first hurdle. To seewe are good enough to do that and complete eight-in-a-row. If nothing  happens, we will have retained our county title and it will be a good year.” The seeding from last years league placings keeps them apart from a Kevin Lynchs side that have been snapping on their heels in recent seasons. The first challenge is Ballinascreen, who pushed the Lynchs every step of the way in last years championship. It took a late Niall Ferris goal to seal the deal, but it wasnt before a Reece McSorley goal and a point from Aaron Kelly had Screen well in the hunt. googletag.cmd.push Cathal McDaid s as manager, with Danny McGrellis, Hugh Pat Kelly, Michael James Groogan and Dave McGurk in the management team. Their new intake of minors includes Niall Doyle, Ronan McKenna, James O’Connor, Emmett Donnelly and Jamie Murray, but theywill be without the injured Ciaran McBride. The Emmets welcome back Paul McNeill after a -month lay-off with a shoulder injury. Liam Cassidys knee injury has recovered and Prionsias Burke has ed from a year studying in Liverpool. “You wouldve thought he had never been away,” said McShane of McNeills , which will also be welcome news for football boss Paul Bradley. “Hewas just so pleased and happy to get back at it. We are in a good position this year, with Paul, Liam and Prionsias all adding to the strength of the . “You were looking at a summer with nothing, but its great to get back as a group in each others company.” In previous seasons, the Slaughtneil football and hurling training schedule was dependent on the next game and what code needed the immediate focus. This year, both teams are going to continue training when possible during the groups, according McShane, before prioritising ahead of the knock-out stages. “Pauland myself are talking very regularly to keep on top of it, so that we are not overworking the lads.” highlighted McShane, who has retained the same management team that includes Alex Campbell, Noel Brick, Bernard Cassidy, Barney and Patrick McEldowney. “It has all been very good so far. The players are happy and the football management is happy,” he added. The players were upbeat about theirto action after the lay-off,while stressing the importance of players taking responsibility for their own health and checking their temperature regularly in the midst of the training programme. “As the saying goes, you never miss the water til the well runs dry. I hope and pray to God we can get on with it, there will be no issues and we can enjoy a summer of hurling and football like we normally do.” In the world of a condensed season and a raft of dual players, an early win will dilute the importance ofgroupgames further down the track. Its hard to look past an early Slaughtneil victory. VERDICT: Slaughtneil RELATED- Early goals make the dference for Kevin Lynchs.

The Erins Own side went into an early lead with points from Ryan McGill, Fintan Bradley and Liam Murphy. Deaglan Foley kept the city men in touch and when they got back into the game. It was point for point and the sides were level at the break, - each. Ciaran Hendry, Paddy Henry and Ryan McGill pushed Lavey three points clear and on their way to victory. It was a good workout, Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey said after the game. googletag.cmd.push It was awkward and it was a tough breeze to play in. Theywere fairly physical and we were happy enough to get a win. The Lavey boss referenced his sides lack of composure in front of goal, allowing Na Magha to stay in the game. I would safely say we had  wides and we gave away a lot of frees and eight of their  scores came from frees, McGarvey added. That makes it dficult, giving away frees for hands on back and wee flicks on men...things that you shouldnt be doing and then we were missing our own frees. That was letting them back into the game. googletag.cmd.push Apart from Ryan McGill having space when he hit the games first point, neither side created an out and out goal chance. I thought Na Magha were very good and they defended very well, the Lavey boss concluded. It is about getting two points and there will be teams sitting on zero points this week. The first game is about winning, we will know all about it with Slaughtneil next. Report and photos in Mondays Derry News and Tuesdays County Derry Post. RELATED- Slaughtneil ease past Screen.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation. Take a trip with confidence Northern Ireland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. googletag.cmd.push The national tourist organisations of Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation. Summer is here and the United Kingdom is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much-needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. googletag.cmd.push Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation. But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines. Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months. “They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry. “All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe. “But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.” Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps. When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book. Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem. Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.  LUXURY STAY: Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey at the Merchant Hotel Relax in five-star luxury Social distancing measures aren’t the only change visitors are experiencing at Belfast’s five-star Merchant Hotel. The hotel has used lockdown time to complete its pound, investment of the Great Room Restaurant and Cocktail Bar. The management team is confident that customers will benefit from, but not be inconvenienced by, the Covid- compliant changes it has also made. The Great Room has been reimagined to create a standalone restaurant and the Cocktail Bar has also benefited from signicant refurbishment. Other venues within the Beannchor Group portfolio have also opened their doors. Beannchor Group managing director Bill Wolsey said: “We’re aware that customers and guests may be curious about the experience that awaits them and, while there are measures in place that follow the scientic guidelines and industry best practice to ensure the safety of our staff and customers at all times, we have striven to minimise the impact to the overall experience at all our venues.” Camping perfect for keeping distance Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond. Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular. middot Wales is open for camping from  July.  Courtesy of Cool Camping Extra measures in place so you can embark on a lakeside holiday Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures. They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.

Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added.

Local playwright Brian Foster recently decided to write a poem about the city, following the positive response when he penned a poem about Creggan where he grew up. .However, he wanted to give people an opportunity to help him write the Derry poem. He started the ball rolling by putting the first line of the poem on to the Memories of Creggan Facebook. He then asked people to come up with ideas for the next line of the poem. Through this process, the poem, entitled My Derry Days, was created. googletag.cmd.push Mr Foster said he was delighted with the response to his initiative. “As far as I’m aware, this is the first time a poem has been written in this online manner by any community anywhere in Ireland. Perhaps even further afield,” he said. “The standard of the entries was so high that the hardest bit was selecting the winning line each night from so many brilliant efforts.” Read more about this story and the finished poem in todays Derry News. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Both Irish Cuip semi-finals – Coleraine vs. Ballymena and Cltonville vs. Glentoran - will be played today at Windsor Park, with the final to be played this Friday.But all such talk of red ribbons on the cup is premature for McLaughlin, who is refusing to look beyond the challenge posed by Mick McDermotts Glens today.“We havent really spoken at all about the final,” McLaughlin stated.“I do know how long its been since the club has won the cup and its crazy to think its been that long because we have had so many great sides down the years. We havent even had that conversation with the players because the sole focus is on Monday.“It will be a really tough game against a good side in Glentoran. Mick McDermott has done a really great job with them and he has them playing well, so it sets it up for a good game, an exciting game. Its a game that we feel we can win, but Im sure Glentoran will be saying the same.” googletag.cmd.push Derry interestThere is a real Derry interest in the last four of the competition this year. With Conor McDermott and Michael McCrudden hoping to help McLaughlin to the trophy this weekend, Glentorans Patrick McClean will have other ideas. For Coleraine, Ben Doherty will be hoping to play a part in a cup final, whilst Joe McCready will be cheering on his team Ballymena from the sidelines as he is cup-tied. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11636074.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...Introducing the motion, Councillor Sean Clarke said: “I believe the Davagh Dark Sky park contains a number of elements of signicancewhich meet the criteria for designation of a world heritage site.”His party colleague, Councillor Cora Corry described Davagh “as the middle of nowhere and the centre of the universe” and said she would be supportingthe motion.Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Councillor Cathal Mallaghan said the work in Davagh over the last number of years has been “pretty spectacular”.“I think this is the next natural step for Davagh to take. Stonehedge is younger than Davagh and you see the signicanceof places like it, so thank-you for the motion Cllr Clarke,” he said.DUP group leader Councillor Paul McLean thanked Councillor Clarke for amending the motion before bringing it to the floor.“My concern is that this is a very costly process and I would just like to see the whole outworkingof the process,” he said.“I believe there will be a lot of officer input. From what I understand it will be a lot of work, it will be good to get our heads around that and seethere is any funding available that can assist us in that process.”UUP Councillor Robert Colvin commended Councillor Clarke for the eloquencewith which he delivered the motion.“I do welcome the word explore becausethe way it was written initially I was concerned Council would have had no more input, this clarication is much appreciated,” said Councillor Colvin.“This exploration has to take into account the livelihood of people in that area and their ability to develop somewhere close to it, we have to think of the here and now.“Having made those comments, as long as that is taken into account, we would support the motion.”SDLP Councillor Kerri Hughes confirmed her party would be supporting the motion and said such recognitionwould really put Davagh and Mid Ulster as a whole “on the map”.Councillor Mark Glasgow said the key to this was going to be “getting the balance right” between protecting the site and allowing the local economy to grow.“From a planning point of view, something could be brought before committee,” said the UUP Councillor. “To ensure we get the right balance that it doesn’t restrict our development plan or business and the further encouragement of tourism in that area.”His party colleague Councillor Walter Cuddy said his initialreaction was that Councillor Clarke was reaching for the stars with this proposal and said he hoped there was no ulterior motive.“We are a bit concerned of the time and effort that could be involved in this and hope it is not for other planning applications nearby thatwe get this into the pipeline it might effect something nearby,” said Cllr Cuddy.“If we can pull it off great but I have serious doubts. The park is not even open yet. I would have thought this would have been good in a year or two’s time when we have something sell and get out there.“That’s why we feel it is maybe a bit too early.”Ulster Unionist Councillor Derek McKinney also expressed concern in relation to planning.“We have just come out of lockdown andthis was to go forward that would put the surrounding area back into lockdown as far as planning was concerned,” said Cllr McKinney.“There is a wider picture to look at here and we need to look at it and see what the consequences may be before we move forward.”Sinn Fein councillor Sean McPeake said that listening to the last few comments he felt people were a bit unnerved by the proposal.“This proposal does not do away with lighting, development can still occur and I think some of the nervousness is .“I place my trust in Councillor Clarke given his passion for the area.”In conclusion Councillor Clarke thanked the chamber for the opportunity to bring the motion forward.“I thought about this for a long time. The dark sky park area is a limited area,” he said.“I thought it was better to keep it compact so that it does not impact on the surrounding community.”The motion received unanimous support in the chamber.Thanking the chamber and describing the motion as a step forward for Mid Ulster, Councillor Clarke invited everyone in the chamber “to come in the near future and see what is there and what we are talking about”.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles.
