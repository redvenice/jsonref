But before the rider left, he asked something they probably weren’t expecting: “Can I take your picture?”Venturi, 39, began studying photography 11 years ago, and has since documented sport, theatre events and social phenomena. Since the outbreak of Covid-19, he has been photographing delivery riders. Speaking down the phone from his home, where he, his partner and their son have been quarantined for two weeks, he tells me how he started to worry about the riders, coming into contact with stranger after stranger, while providing an essential service to those who can afford to self-isolate. As he started ordering more deliveries, he asked each rider – from a safe distance – about their lives under coronavirus.Most told him they weren’t worried, because they take precautions, as do customers. But 23-year-old Andrea, delivering sushi, wasn’t so sure. “I’m not calm,” he told Venturi. “Even if I take all the precautions, people tend to touch you, to take risks – they assume neither of you are infected. But I could be, or they could be. How do I know that they’re not in quarantine?”Venturi tells me he was struck by both the lack of consideration given to riders’ health, and their lack of choice when it came to doing the job. Davide, 25, was laid off when the restaurant he worked for closed down his second job as a personal trainer has also been terminated. Delivering burgers to make ends meet, Davide hasn’t been given a mask or gloves. “If they want them, they have to buy them themselves,” Venturi says. “Before the crisis, they cost one or two euros each – now they cost €20 or €30. And it’s not as if they can wear them for days and days.”Naturally, the lockdown made some interviews difficult. While most people were happy to talk, Venturi says, a driver called Antonio would only tell him, “I work in black.” Why? “I think it was his way of explaining that he couldn’t tell me anything else. The police roam the streets, making sure anyone who is out has a valid reason. I think he was worried that being photographed and interviewed wasn’t a good enough reason.” Delivery riders have witnessed the multiple ways people deal with their anxieties about contagion.Simone, 32, brought Venturi breakfast from a nearby coffee bar. The venue had always delivered pizza in the evening, but expanded their hours to deliver from 9am to 10pm. He reported that one customer laid out kitchen towels on the floor outside the door, and asked him to place the bag on top. “Perhaps that’s a little excessive,” Venturi says, “but taking it from his hand would mean standing closer than a metre.” Simone wears a mask and always keeps a metre away from a customer, so he’s not very worried. His main fear is that the situation could get worse. “I fear that the government might also consider stopping home deliveries,” he says.An unexpected upside was shared by 19-year-old Lucian. Generally, people do not tip in Italy now, in an effort to avoid touching notes and coins, customers are telling him to keep the change.“So he’s making more money, and that’s better for him, but the reason is sad,” Venturi says. “They’re not being generous – they’re afraid of him.”At the time of writing, the mortality rate for Covid-19 in Italy is the highest in the world, in part because the population is older. But Venturi is concerned that many younger people don’t seem to grasp that they, too, are potentially at risk.Alessandro, 21, told Venturi: “I’m calm when I work. I’m more worried about my band. We have an album coming out and we’re supposed to do a European tour in the late summer. I worry that everything will be cancelled.”The photographer says a lot of older people are frustratingly complacent, too: “They often think they’re safe if they don’t have cardiac or respiratory problems.”Though the job lacks the hero status afforded health workers and firefighters, Venturi points out that delivery riders have also risked their health so that others can stay safe and fed. Their lives might be tough or precarious in normal circumstances currently, they are even more so. “They bring food to people who are staying safe in their homes, but that puts them at greater risk. And they in turn risk taking it home and passing it on to family.” Why shouldn’t they keep the change?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2716b33f1ac8ef76665f02a69507d3898bbe8267/699_128_2432_1459/master/2432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3349ab3297a1a728eb5d3848f5b548bc","title":"sports direct mike ashley apologises for poor covid 19 actions","story":"After trying to keep shops open, boss says emails to government were ill-judged and poorly timedMike Ashley has issued a public apology after his spat with the government about trying to keep his Sports Direct chain open when non-essential businesses were ordered to close.Ashley’s Frasers Group, which includes House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, had intended to keep Sports Direct open as other non-essential retailers closed, on the basis that selling sporting and fitness equipment made the company a vital asset as Britons were forced to stay at home.He eventually bowed to government pressure and shut his stores on Tuesday but is continuing to operate online via the group’s Derbyshire warehouse, where the company has admitted it is struggling to enforce the government’s Covid-19 regulations for thousands of workers. People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“I am deeply apologetic about the misunderstandings of the last few days,” Ashley said in an open letter. “Given what has taken place over the last few days, I thought it was necessary to address and apologise for much of what has been reported across various media outlets regarding my personal actions and those of the Frasers Group business.”In its attempt to stay open, the company went as far as lobbying Boris Johnson directly with a public tweet after the prime minister on Monday ordered that all non-essential stores should close.Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday that Sports Direct had made the wrong call and that its stores should not be open. Its management had “got the message”, Gove added, after Sports Direct agreed to close stores.Ashley said on Friday: “Our intentions were only to seek clarity from the government as to whether we should keep some of our stores open. We would never have acted against their advice. In hindsight, our emails to the government were ill-judged and poorly timed, when they clearly had much greater pressures than ours to deal with. On top of this our communications to our employees and the public on this was poor.”Ashley said the company had since sought to make amends by offering its entire fleet of lorries to help deliver medical equipment and supplies for the NHS and all key workforces across government. “We will help wherever possible,” he said.Ashley also praised his workers, some of whom were made to come in on Tuesday for tasks such as stocktaking.“I would especially like to thank my Frasers Group employees, who have stood by the business in difficult times and are doing so currently,” he said. “We are working very hard to save our business. We will learn from this and will try not to make the same mistakes in the future.”The government subsequently added bike shops to the list of essential businesses that can stay open. Ashley’s Evans Cycles is considering reopening its doors as a result."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be350730e6e74bc124aef4aa454c808393df1383/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52cca933f28dfdc433f7150aff5c6041","title":"coronavirus politics lockdown hobbes","story":"In a lockdown, we can see the essence of politics is still what Hobbes described: some people get to tell others what to doWe keep hearing that this is a war. Is it really? What helps to give the current crisis its wartime feel is the apparent absence of normal political argument. The prime minister goes on TV to issue a sombre statement to the nation about the curtailment of our liberties and the leader of the opposition offers nothing but support. Parliament, insofar as it is able to operate at all, appears to be merely going through the motions. People are stuck at home, and their fights are limited to the domestic sphere. There is talk of a government of national unity. Politics-as-usual has gone missing.But this is not the suspension of politics. It is the stripping away of one layer of political life to reveal something more raw underneath. In a democracy we tend to think of politics as a contest between different parties for our support. We focus on the who and the what of political life: who is after our votes, what they are offering us, who stands to benefit. We see elections as the way to settle these arguments. But the bigger questions in any democracy are always about the how: how will governments exercise the extraordinary powers we give them? And how will we respond when they do?These are the questions that have always preoccupied political theorists. But now they are not so theoretical. As the current crisis shows, the primary fact that underpins political existence is that some people get to tell others what to do. At the heart of all modern politics is a trade-off between personal liberty and collective choice. This is the Faustian bargain identified by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in the middle of the 17th century, when the country was being torn apart by a real civil war.As Hobbes knew, to exercise political rule is to have the power of life and death over citizens. The only reason we would possibly give anyone that power is because we believe it is the price we pay for our collective safety. But it also means that we are entrusting life-and-death decisions to people we cannot ultimately control.The primary risk is that those on the receiving end refuse to do what they are told. At that point, there are only two choices. Either people are forced to obey, using the coercive powers the state has at its disposal. Or politics breaks down altogether, which Hobbes argued was the outcome we should fear most of all.In a democracy, we have the luxury of waiting for the next election to punish political leaders for their mistakes. But that is scant consolation when matters of basic survival are at stake. Anyway, it’s not much of a punishment, relatively speaking. They might lose their jobs, though few politicians wind up destitute. We might lose our lives.The rawness of these choices is usually obscured by the democratic imperative to seek consensus. That has not gone away. The government is doing all it can to dress up its decisions in the language of commonsense advice. It says it is still trusting iniduals to show sound judgment. But as the experience of other European countries shows, as the crisis deepens the stark realities become clearer. Just watch the footage of Italian mayors screaming at their constituents to stay at home. “Vote for me or the other lot get in” is routine democratic politics. “Do this or else” is raw democratic politics. At that point it doesn’t look so different from politics of any other kind.This crisis has revealed some other hard truths. National governments really matter, and it really matters which one you happen to find yourself under. Though the pandemic is a global phenomenon, and is being experienced similarly in many different places, the impact of the disease is greatly shaped by decisions taken by inidual governments. Different views about when to act and how far to go still mean that no two nations are having the same experience. At the end of it all we may get to see who was right and what was wrong. But for now, we are at the mercy of our national leaders. That is something else Hobbes warned about: there is no avoiding the element of arbitrariness at the heart of all politics. It is the arbitrariness of inidual political judgment.Under a lockdown, democracies reveal what they have in common with other political regimes: here too politics is ultimately about power and order. But we are also getting to see some of the fundamental differences. It is not that democracies are nicer, kinder, gentler places. They may try to be, but in the end that doesn’t last. Democracies do, though, find it harder to make the really tough choices. Pre-emption – the ability to tackle a problem before it becomes acute – has never been a democratic strength. We wait until we have no choice and then we adapt. That means democracies are always going to start off behind the curve of a disease like this one, though some are better at playing catch-up than others.Autocratic regimes such as China also find it hard to face up to crises until they have to – and, unlike democracies, they can suppress the bad news for longer if it suits them. But when action becomes unavoidable, they can go further. The Chinese lockdown succeeded in containing the disease through ruthless pre-emption. Democracies are capable of being equally ruthless – as they showed when prosecuting the total wars of the 20th century.But in a war, the enemy is right in front of you. During this pandemic the disease reveals where it has got to only in the daily litany of infections and deaths. Democratic politics becomes a kind of shadow boxing: the state doesn’t know which bodies are the really dangerous ones.Some democracies have managed to adapt faster: in South Korea the disease is being tamed by extensive tracing and widespread surveillance of possible carriers. But in that case, the regime had recent experience to draw on in its handling of the Mers outbreak of 2015, which also shaped the collective memory of its citizens. Israel may also be doing a better job than many European countries – but it is a society already on a permanent warlike footing. It is easier to adapt when you have adapted already. It is much harder when you are making it up as you go along.In recent years, it has sometimes appeared that global politics is simply a choice between rival forms of technocracy. In China, it is a government of engineers backed up by a one-party state. In the west, it is the rule of economists and central bankers, operating within the constraints of a democratic system. This creates the impression that the real choices are technical judgments about how to run vast, complex economic and social systems.But in the last few weeks another reality has pushed through. The ultimate judgments are about how to use coercive power. These aren’t simply technical questions. Some arbitrariness is unavoidable. And the contest in the exercise of that power between democratic adaptability and autocratic ruthlessness will shape all of our futures. We are a long way from the frightening and violent world that Hobbes sought to escape nearly 400 years ago. But our political world is still one Hobbes would recognise.• David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ef94b252d7930a01594ae204c72eb1b24dd9558/0_0_5073_3044/master/5073.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc92e2baf97b3c76c20a4f4450be969f","title":"move in partner survive isolating without them coronavirus","story":"For many young couples, moving in together isn’t an option. The best thing to do is treat it as a long-distance relationshipSince the coronavirus outbreak reached the UK, I’ve only seen my boyfriend for five minutes, when he dropped off some baba ganoush and paracetamol at my flat. I was scared I might infect him, so we had an emotionally charged conversation at two metres’ distance, which felt like a combination of a chaste Regency courtship drama and a young adult dystopian romance. It’s a strange situation: six months into our relationship, we’re having to weather the obstacle of a global pandemic, and the potential role our romance could play in spreading it. I can say with certainty that neither of us planned for this.But we feel like there isn’t much choice other than to get on with it. Earlier this week, Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, made an announcement that sent a chill down the spine of the nation’s commitment-phobes. Speaking to the BBC, she suggested that couples currently living in separate households should either remain apart or “test the strength of their relationship” by moving in together. British couples are now faced with a stark choice between spending far too much or far too little time with one other. It’s hard to think of a less promising context in which to progress a relationship.Even if you are really keen on the idea of experiencing the slow death of love while confined to a zone-3 houseshare, the fact is that for most young renters moving in together isn’t as straightforward as that. Most young people live with flatmates, who could reasonably object to a new person shedding hairs down the drain – and that’s before you even take into consideration the, you know, virus going around.Renters can’t just dip in and out of their contract, either. Even during a pandemic, your landlord is unlikely to accept “I just really think it’s time me and my boyfriend get serious – it’s been six months!” as a valid breakout clause. This means that, for many couples, moving in together simply isn’t an option, no matter how willing they are to test the strength of the relationship. And that’s without even considering the numbers of couples where one half is in a high-risk group and already isolating.Some of us might just have to accept that we’re not going to see our significant other for some time. I am of the exact demographic that Harries is addressing, having not seen my boyfriend for several weeks. I’ve been self-isolating with a fever that comes and goes, along with a shortness of breath that could possibly be imaginary (these days being a hypochondriac is a moral responsibility). It’s one of those situations where I probably don’t have Covid-19 but it’s better to act as if I do, particularly because I’ve internalised the idea that practising anything less than perfect physical-distancing ethics is “Tory”. I’d rather live as a hermit than face such a charge. Now I’m recovered, we have been plunged into a sudden “long distance” relationship, with all the yearning and frustration that entails, despite living within walking distance of one another.Ultimately, it feels churlish to complain given how much worse our situation could be. But being separated from my partner is still difficult. I miss him in a way that texting or Skyping doesn’t satisfy. There have been moments when I’ve struggled to get my breath or woken up drenched in sweat and wished I wasn’t alone. The situation I’m in feels potentially endless, given the impossibility of getting tested – something that has become an elite status symbol reserved for public figures.What makes it so difficult is that at times like this, a relationship comes in handy. In the absence of any kind of structure or routine, some of us need another person around to shame us, just with their presence, into being a functioning human being. Otherwise, it’s all too easy to slip into a parody of adolescence: eating too much cereal or staying up till 2am in lieu of any reason to wake up the next morning. While I receive a lot of epistolary support from being in a relationship, I need a warden as much as a penpal.If you do find yourself separated from your partner, maybe the best thing to do is acclimatise, treat it like a long-distance relationship, and embrace the various digital channels through which you can approximate intimacy. Video chat is of course the closest thing you get to a face-to-face conversation. It’s important to speak every day, even if you’ll eventually stop asking, “What have you been up to?” all you’ll ever have done is feel anxious while hunched over a laptop at an angle guaranteed to give you lifelong back problems. At least there’s the ongoing collapse of the global economic order, which should keep conversation ticking over for a while.If you’ve run out of things to say to each other, you can load up Netflix Party, recreating the magical experience of sitting in silence and watching a terrible made-for-streaming romcom with an original soundtrack by Selena Gomez. Maybe these long-distance coronavirus love affairs aren’t that different to real life ones after all.• James Greig is a journalist based in London, and writes for Vice, i-D and Huck"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cabc9fde0b838b0c7be4cfe68f2d0303199ac4c/0_0_6312_3790/master/6312.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5822e2615624a03ada016feef2c0c065","title":"coronavirus lockdown affects arts workers","story":"We asked arts workers for their stories of how the lockdown is affecting their livelihoods. Here are their responsesThis week we asked arts workers to share how their livelihoods were being affected by the coronavirus. Since then, the UK government’s measures to give financial aid to the self-employed will help the sector – but many are still deeply concerned about the lack of work available in the coming months. Here are some of the nearly 150 stories we received. Thanks to everyone who got in touch.Stephen Laughton, 38, playwright and TV writerMy play, One Jewish Boy, opened in the West End on 10 March – a huge step up for me. I had TV deals lined up, a movie deal on the cards, another play about to start in New York. The play managed to stay open for one week. It got us to press night, and much like its original fringe run, was a critical success – four and five stars, and that first week was packed out. It was the moment I’d been waiting for. But I knew what was coming – a moment I hoped I would cherish for ever was tinged with crushing defeat. It felt as if everything we had worked for – all the abuse (my play is about antisemitism and I was on the receiving end of a lot of it), all the hard work, the blood, joy, sweat and tears – just faded away. The next day it got worse: I didn’t quite take in the monumental loss of having every gig I had lined up, cancelled. In the short term, I’m pretty screwed, the financial loss from the cancellation of two plays, a TV and a film gig has hit the tens of thousands. That makes it sound as if I always earn at this level – I don’t and I haven’t. I’ve been working hand to mouth and now, when it looked as if I might finally be able to breathe, I don’t know when I’ll get paid again. I just need to find a way to keep my head above water.Michael Heggett, 59, lighting engineerMy entire work calendar for 2020 went away in the three days from 16 March. I lost the Pet Shop Boys world tour and the Olympic Games, which amounts to nine months of solid work and around £60,000 gross turnover. I have no other work on my books until November, which is a UK tour with Tim Minchin – if it goes ahead. As venues are closed and also gatherings of people banned and film sets closed, I will not be able to earn a living for the foreseeable time. My business and livelihood are completely destroyed.Matthew Reed, 40, comedianI had a full diary of gigs, a full summer of festivals and various clubs around the country, then overnight nothing, wiping out every penny for the foreseeable. My agents, Getcomedy, have been brilliant, but there’s no work, so they, too, are in a terrible situation. I’m a compere and in demand – I play every major club on the circuit and have done for years. So to go from every weekend full and plenty of midweek gigs to zero has been terrifying. The fragility of my situation has y crept up on me, and it’s also shown how little people really care. At a comedy night, if you do well you’re told: “Well done”, back slapped, thanked for a good night. “Couldn’t do what you do mate. It takes balls.” Now my entire income has gone I’ve been told, “Well, you’re just a comedian!” and, “Get a proper job.” I’ve had “proper” jobs – I’ve worked very hard to be where I am and comedy is a job. I’ve travelled miles for 20-minute sets, and the pay has been the same since I started – our wages haven’t gone up with inflation. People assume we are on a fortune, which just isn’t true. I absolutely love being a comedian, and this has been the worst thing that’s ever happened to me professionally. But apparently it’s not as valid as an office worker losing their “proper job”.Anonymous, actor for 37 yearsAfter a good five months in theatre and television and feeling as if I was turning a corner after a difficult period, I found the rug pulled from under my feet. Future work cancelled. Income owed not likely to be received. No hope of working in my career for many, many months to come. I am already writing this year off. My industry has been decimated and the aftermath will be catastrophic. I do not know how I will survive this with no savings behind me. I love my job, but I feel totally broken and my mental health is very, very fragile.Denise Francis, 55, director of theatre education company Firehorse ProductionsI had three actors on contract for a five-week tour in June and July – this has now been cancelled, as schools are shut. There may be a slight chance we can scramble a three-week tour for November, but it is the two autumn tours that sustain us throughout the year, and not being able to produce them jeopardises the future of Firehorse. Two years ago, I also established the charity Afan Arts, giving the opportunity to pupils from surrounding schools to work alongside professional actors and film crews. Our third project Same But Different, two years in the planning, was due to begin at the end of July, but this has had to be cancelled. The year 11 pupils were devastated, another thing they have missed out on. We invest in our actors, love to see them grow and flourish – now we will not see that this year. It has been like watching your world crumble.Anonymous, 37, actorOn 16 March, a couple of hours before our cast were due on stage, we were told our show was cancelled that evening with immediate effect. Since then, it has become apparent that the production will not reopen anytime soon, and as yet we have no clarity on whether we will continue to be paid. My biggest fear is that our producer may be forced to use the force majeure clause in our contracts, allowing them to terminate our employment with immediate effect. Were that to happen, I would be left £40,000 out of pocket, that figure representing what I would have earned during the remainder of the show’s run.Colette Meacher, writer, editor and lecturerI’ve had mild symptoms of Covid-19, but as I effectively work on zero-hours contracts I’m not eligible for statutory sick pay. And, as it’s now the Easter break, my teaching hours are finished and my freelance editing and writing work has dried up, meaning that I don’t have a single commission or job on my desk. I’m stressed, sick and skint – but I’d still be working if I could as I urgently and desperately need some money for the mortgage, bills and, heck, even just to be able to go out and buy some food. It’s been nearly four weeks since I last got paid, and that was a grand total of £600 – pretty good by most months’ standards.Mike Nichamin, 56, live audio systems engineerAll touring is off as venues have closed and large gatherings banned. I was on tour in Europe at the time with the show An Evening with Whitney Houston, a hologram tour. I have now applied to Tesco as a delivery driver for £9 an hour, which won’t even cover my expenses.Bethany, 20, dancerI’m supposed to be moving to Greece at the end of March for a seven-month contract, but obviously with no flights this has been postponed for the foreseeable. This is extremely distressing as for dancers a summer season can sometimes be their only income for the year. With so much uncertainty, I’m not sure if I will ever get there to complete the season, and in the meantime I’m stuck in the UK with no income.Anonymous, 30, artistAs a self-employed artist, my work is piecemeal and precarious. I don’t have a fixed income and my earnings fluctuate month to month. I’m still in receipt of the ghostly working tax credits, which has been a lifeline in more difficult times but at £54 a week are not enough to live on. Occasionally I sell a work, pick up some teaching hours or am successful with a funding application. While the financial impact of Covid-19 is massive on those working in the arts, the impact of coronavirus goes beyond the loss of wages – it affects our visibility. Projects which have been in the pipeline for many months are put on hold, or no longer possible. Perhaps they lose their relevance as this global crisis escalates as it has. Galleries and cultural spaces rearrange their programmes, pushing an already competitive workforce into greater competition for places. This situation is complicated for us all, but without support, we risk a whole generation of artists slipping away.David, 32, artist and gallery workerMany artists work freelance as either an assistant to a more established artist, or as a technicianhandler for museums and galleries. I fall in this latter group. I love the work – we do anything from packing up prints to building gallery walls or making bespoke elements of the exhibition. With museums and galleries closed until further notice, the workforce who build and hang the exhibitions are simply not required. The work is always seasonal, and so we have large chunks of work booked months ahead, knowing that we have a two- to three-month gap in work while the exhibition is open to the public. I’ve had a mixed response to coronavirus closures. One gallery has said that it will honour booked work and pay freelancers regardless of whether we are physically able to complete the job. This is absolutely wonderful and will help hugely. It is, however, an exception rather than the norm. Most galleries and museums have cancelled work – I’ve lost work equivalent to two and a half months’ pay, and from talking to friends, that seems quite light.Jonny Byers, 39, cellistI had a full diary of wor, and every single concert until at least July has been cancelled or, at best, postponed. An entire tour of a Handel opera a week of Beethoven symphonies concerts at smaller venues such as the Wigmore Hall. A completely empty diary, which means £0 coming in. Many of the groups I perform for won’t have a large amount of financial reserves so are now walking an even thinner tightrope attempting to ride out this storm. I have bills, instrument insurance, not to mention food buying, and many other outgoings to attempt to cover with no idea how it’s all going to pan out. Sadly, everyone is in the same boat right now, but once orchestras are gone, they’re gone, and we’ll need music more than ever after this.Dan, 37, stage managerOne show was cancelled mid-run and we were told not to come in the next day. The following job, which was supposed to take me to July, was postponed until 2021. All income has stopped and with no help from the government so far, we have had to contact our landlords and bill providers to plead for a payment break. We will get to a point where we have to choose between paying bills and eating. There is no safety net. I am also in the unfortunate situation that I have a very sick relative in hospital which, added to the worry about no income and possible eviction, is having a huge detrimental effect on my mental health.Anonymous, 30, freelance stage managerSo far, I have lost out on thousands. Last week, the tour that I was working on was cancelled after the government urged people not to go out. There were no compensation measures as all insurances were void when the WHO declared the virus a pandemic. The promoter took their fee back, tickets were refunded and the artist made a huge loss. All future bookings have been postponed too. A two-month project that I was meant to start on 1 April has been pushed back, but we don’t know when that will be rescheduled. Festivals have been cancelled. My next working day is currently 1 July, but that could also be postponed. That’s three and a half months of loss of earnings – and to add salt to my wounds, I’m due to get married overseas in September.Clare, 51, self-employed art tutorAs a result of the current situation I closed the studio last week. Many of the artists who attend are over 70, and although the classes are small I can’t guarantee safety. I have set up a WhatsApp group to keep us all in touch with each other – we share experiences, jokes and thoughts as well as art-related articles. Today, I launched an online art class to which nearly 40 of the group have signed up. So far, it seems to be working despite my lack of techie knowledge – think Acorn Antiques level of production. I hope this will provide some income to tide me over until I can reopen the studio, and will keep the social element of the group together.Anonymous, 45, community artistI work full time in the community and all my work is on freelance contracts. In two days, every project I have got cancelled as they are all people-based. I have no income, no sick pay, and my work diary is a black hole. I am used to uncertainty and flexibility in my work, but now I feel totally baffled as to how I will get an income. I don’t know when or if these projects will ever be rescheduled, and I worry about some of the people I work with who depend on the social aspect of these arts projects – one project I worked on involves making artworks for a recovery garden, for people with addictions, and I worry about how they are coping alone. We will be needed to help restore community spirit when this crisis is over – arts are never valued by the government, yet people are surviving these hard times through creativity and resourcefulness.Peter, 44, freelance opera singerThe theatres are shut. I’m fortunate enough to have current extra chorus contracts honoured, but future ones are undecided. With schools, each one has its own safeguarding policy and setting up teaching from home is problematic – hours are down already. All of the concerts I’ve had lined up are postponed or cancelled, auditionstoo. Regular chorister work in synagogue has stopped and the church that I regularly sing at are paying up to June. My private teaching has stopped – even though it’s a few students, over time you really start to feel it. I’m losing more than half of my income, with projected expectations that the industry will suffer longer and there will be less work in the future. I will need to adapt and find other sources.Gillian Garrity, 48, theatre producerMy business partner, Margaret-Anne O’Donnell, and I started our own producing company, Raw Material Arts, two years ago. We have worked in the theatre industry for more than 20 years each, touring theatre within the UK and across the world. A UKAustralian co-production that was due to tour to 12 venues across Scotland beginning next month has been cancelled a tour to an arts festival in Egypt has been cancelled an artist residency due to take place in Nepal has been cancelled we have three midlarge scale co-productions with three Scottish venues now on hold a New York transfer of a current production on hold. Our potential to earn income has frozen. We work with and employ directors, lighting designers, sound designers, actors, stage managers, costume designers and many more freelance artists. We have received support from Creative Scotland to pay our team for projects that have taken place andor are already funded, but we cannot deliver. We have no means to rehearse or present any work, meaning we have no potential to earn income.Anonymous, 39, stage managerI don’t know anyone who’s still working, the entire industry has gone. The theatres all shut once Boris Johnson advised people not to go – there was no more work to do. I went to help clear the rehearsal room we had been using and that was that. I’ve worked since I was 17, I’ve never not had a job. I’ve always paid my taxes and I’ve used the benefits system once to cover a gap of five weeks between contracts back when I first moved to London in 2009. Now I don’t know what to do. My partner is in the same position and has lost a year’s work, as has my sister, as have most of my friends. We have a little bit of a buffer, probably enough to survive the next month or two, but beyond that things are pretty scary. I’m happy to do whatever I need – I’ve handed out CVs in supermarkets, filled out forms online, but so far no replies. I just think people see theatre on a CV and don’t know what to do with it, or assume you’ll be some kind of luvvie who moans about breaking a nail. The reality is we’re used to 16-hour days, 50-plus hour weeks, hard physical work, problem solving and team working, not to mention working under pressure to a deadline. After all, the show must go on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caef1fbddddbbbebb686830615f0558531475333/0_0_5295_3178/master/5295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d874ed6ccdb5ad3767a8a6ecd0c9aa5","title":"school closures prompt boom in private tuition online isolation","story":"Surge in demand for online tuition, while rich families take tutors into isolation with themThe private tuition industry is booming amid the coronavirus pandemic, with school closures and fears of infection driving unprecedented demand for online teaching.UK tutoring firms said there had been a surge in online tuition in the past three weeks as parents anticipated and then responded to the decision to close schools indefinitely.Meanwhile, several agencies said some wealthy families had requested tutors go into isolation with them on remote country estates or super-yachts.Leo Evans, a co-founder of The Profs, a tuition firm that works with around 2,000 schoolchildren and 3,000 university students internationally each year, said: “There has been a hike in online tutoring related to existential concerns around the coronavirus and schools being shut.”Evans said the number of daily users of its online classroom platform BitPaper had risen more than sixfold in two weeks, from 5,000 to 32,000 . “There were 11,000 hours of online classes on Monday, almost a fifteenfold rise from 750 hours on 2 March,” he said. “It’s absolutely exploded since the coronavirus.” “There’s been a huge shift,” she said. “Most homeschooled students in London have transitioned to online learning this week, and those families who can are staying in the countryside. This week 16 new homeschoolers have joined. We have another 11 starting after the Easter break.”Titley said a drop-off in demand for GCSE revision as a result of the cancellation of exams had been more than offset by demand for other tutoring. For example, private schools were continuing to assess key-stage three pupils, aged 11-14, and after Easter some schools will start A-level courses for those pupils who were due to do GCSEs this summer. One of the Golden Circle’s clients, Claudine Ries, who lives in central London, has switched to online tutoring for her 16-year-old son who is studying for US exams.She said: “We are trying to socially isolate by seeing fewer friends and staying away from large crowds. We switched to online tutoring mainly because we felt it would unnecessarily expose the tutors who need to travel to our house while they could be isolating themselves at home.”Adam Caller, the founder of Tutors International, which caters to rich families, said he had received several requests from clients in the past few weeks for tutors to go into isolation with them at short notice.“We’ve seen a sudden rush, especially from Switzerland,” said Caller. “They’re looking for tutors who are willing to come and be locked in. One family has relocated from an area affected by the Covid-19 outbreak in northern Italy to St Moritz in the Swiss Alps.“Another family, from Dubai, want to go and hide on their super-yacht in the Mediterranean. It’s paying £24,000 a month to the tutor.”Mark MacLaine, the founder of Tutorfair, said one tutor had gone into isolation with a family in upstate New York, and another family who had flown to the Caribbean to escape the outbreak were now receiving online tuition.MacLaine said the additional demand was a boost to Britain’s private tuition sector, worth an estimated £2bn.He said this year could be his highest earning yet because so many families were looking for private tuition due to the uncertainty over the next academic year.“A few of my A-level students have decided to resit their exams next year but most want to keep working,” he said. “A couple of parents said they’ll have their kids resit their GCSEs in their A-level year if they have to.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc63932315d2ab8fbcb83575c103add1e5d1f9ba/149_0_1726_1035/master/1726.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90759b5ba4c348c46bf3fa93ed1f2343","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including a puma on the streets of Santiago, Chile"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99e6ad79c1b8df25ead07d8c6cdeb72a37bdeeb9/0_145_1536_922/master/1536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7525a16ee79a74f0c79057758c113819","title":"corona coronavirus the movie is somehow already here but are we ready for it","story":"Corona, the first full-length feature about the pandemic, is a one-shot thriller set in an elevator, an impressively speedy, if dubious, featIn these times of self-isolation, it’s easy to sit back and plot the type of coronavirus movie you’d like to make. Maybe it’s one about an embattled team of scientists and their desperate search for a vaccine. Maybe it’s one about an estranged father who has to fight his way through police lines in order to give his son a birthday present. Maybe – because not everything can be a gritty drama – it’s a hilarious comedy about a man whose trousers fall down whenever he coughs.Either way, the ideas you have right now are just that: ideas. If you had any real gumption, you’d have followed the footsteps of the Canadian director Mostafa Keshvari and already written and shot an entire coronavirus feature film.Because, incredibly, Keshvari appears to have done just that. Entitled Corona, the film takes place entirely within the confines of an elevator. Neighbours of different backgrounds enter – a Chinese lady, a pregnant woman, a wheelchair-bound Nazi with a swastika tattoo on his forehead – and panic begins to spread just as quickly as the disease. Or, as the movie’s tagline puts it, “Fear is a Virus”.A trailer for the film has already been released. Not to give too much away but – if I’m reading this right – the Chinese woman starts coughing, which causes the elevator to stall. The lights go out. The emergency lights kick in, and for some reason they’re red flashing submarine-style lights. Someone screams: “We’re all going to die in here!” The Nazi pulls out a gun. The Chinese woman starts crying. And then a man says: “I think we’re all being tested,” which leads me to believe that Corona will posit that the spread of Covid-19 is down to an evil Saw-style puppet who created the virus in a lab as an unnecessarily complicated no-win morality test for humanity.I could be wrong, and I won’t know until Corona hits the streaming services soon. But still, you can’t knock the director’s ambition. Keshvari had written the film, shot it and cut the trailer by 8 March, days before overt public jumpiness and weeks before the lockdown. You may have seen the spectre of the virus as a threat to your friends and family, but not Keshvari. He saw it as an opportunity to make a name for himself.He’s by no means a beginner – his short film I Ran was selected in the 2015 Cannes Short Corner Film Festival – but by almost definitely making the world’s first coronavirus feature film, Keshvari’s stock is bound to rise. Not an awful lot is known about him but, judging by his IMDb page, he used to be a banker, he gained a scholarship at Vancouver Film School, he’s making a thriller about women’s rights, he’s a published poet and his personal quotes include: “Your life is a movie, direct it before someone else will” and “Point the camera where the light is and pull focus on your dreams.” Hopefully he has a long movie career ahead of him. But, if he doesn’t, you get the feeling that he’d do quite well in the inspirational vinyl wall decal business.What’s even more impressive about Corona is that Keshvari was able to add a level of en vogue artistry to the film, by recording the whole thing in a single shot. It should be seen as a distant cousin to 1917, perhaps.When all this blows over and we’re hit with a deluge of Contagion-style films about the virus – some by established auteurs, some by plucky up-and-comers – we should make sure that we don’t forget about Corona. We shouldn’t have to watch it, because God knows time is precious, but we shouldn’t forget about it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2904f74e32eb3394c380706a4415c3834994d798/0_134_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec9179e5bc980ad6700882103ad834b","title":"we ran and we ran and now weve found ourselves back in 1978","story":"Sign up now!

With many readers also self-isolating, one of the British news industry’s main sources of revenue has taken a heavy hit.Organisations representing national newspapers have even had to promote guidance from the World Health Organization that newsprint does not pose a transmission risk.Some free local print news outlets have already stopped printing for the duration of the crisis, while regional titles that rely on advertising revenue from small businesses have been particularly badly hit. Although the pandemic has attracted record-breaking audiences for online news sources, outlets have long struggled to earn substantial revenue from digital advertising. Some advertisers have also blocked their promotions from appearing along coronavirus-related stories, although there has been increased spending by the government on public health campaigns and by some major corporations such as banks.Industry sources suggested sales of print outlets briefly rose in the run-up to the lockdown but have collapsed since people were asked to stay at home. One inidual at a major national newspaper said the sales painted a “pretty bleak picture for us”, while a person at another title said the situation was “dire” but there had been “surges in home deliveries via independent newsagents”.A spokesperson for the ’s parent company said the crisis was having a “clearly negative impact on advertising revenues for all businesses, and the  will be no exception”, acknowledging that print sales had been hit, but said more people were signing up to have the newspaper delivered. Print revenue – both from the cover price paid by readers and print adverts – continues to provide the majority of revenue at most British newspapers, often in effect underwriting the cost of free online content. As a result almost all national newspapers are promoting offers that will ensure people can still get their print copies delivered directly to their homes, through sites such as DeliverMyNewspaper.Free newspapers have been particularly badly hit by the collapse in commuters and ad revenue, with London’s Evening Standard adopting an improvised door-to-door delivery model, with a reduced circulation of just over 400,000 copies being posted through letterboxes in the centre of the capital.Hyperlocal community news outlets have also issued a collective plea to the government for emergency funding and a share of public information advertising spending, in an effort to avoid collapse. Staff at the news agency PA Media have also been told that pay rises will be delayed and warned that open roles are unlikely to be filled.Nielsen echoed the concern of many in the industry when he said a particular worry for British newspapers was that remaining print readers would lose the habit of reading a physical product during the lockdown.“People are going to spend a lot of time online for the foreseeable future,” he said. “And so far, we have few examples of people returning to offline media once they have embraced online ones.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02afdfe606b8a7a52524fa10360e5fd720e5fa49/0_367_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f935a7de3a200c2ae49ca6ae0d54a09f","title":"lets move to linlithgow west lothian","story":"There’s still romance here, but the seat of monarchs has given way to humble, suburban dreamsWhat’s going for it? Linlithgow wears its 21st-century role as a commuter town in the sweet spot between Edinburgh and Glasgow in the way a megastar of stage or screen might – someone who, in later life, has had cause to stack shelves in Lidl. Nothing wrong with stacking shelves or, indeed, Lidl. But Linlithgow has known grander times. This, I’ll have you know, is the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, and it has the palace to prove it, ta-dah on its hilltop pedestal, as if anyone could ignore it. Don’t you know who I was? True, the palace lacks a roof these days. Yet this palace gave birth to Mary, Queen of Scots. This palace was the centre of the Stuart dynasty. This palace’s fountain once flowed with wine, it’s said, for the marriage of James V and Mary of Guise. Still, those days have long gone. Although there’s romance still in its polished old streets, today it’s a romance designed, not as a stage set for monarchy, political intrigue and government, but for more humble, suburban dreams, and propping up house prices. Linlithgow has grown accustomed to its new role: capital of Silicon Glen, Queen of Middle Scotland, provider of comfy sofas and Netflix filming locations to the strivers of Edinburgh and Glasgow.The case against… It’s a small town of commuters: kids and beatniks will want to escape – though worry not, the fleshpots of Edinburgh and Glasgow are nearby. It’s a victim of its own popularity: traffic, parking, house prices and oversubscribed schools.Well connected? Trains: to Edinburgh (20 mins) and Glasgow (30 mins, via Falkirk), with up to four an hour during rush hour. Driving: you’re right on the M9, so it’s 45 mins to central Edinburgh or Glasgow, 20 mins to Edinburgh airport or the other way to Falkirk.Schools Primaries: quality indicators at Linlithgow and nearby Springfield are mostly “very good” or “good”, according to Education Scotland there are no current reports for St Joseph’s RC or Linlithgow Bridge. Secondaries: Linlithgow Academy has no current report, but a fine reputation.Hang out at… The Champany Inn serves old-skool cosy classics like cullen skink.

Next up: iconic New York songwriter Fiona AppleWhen the Pawn … (1999)After writing her debut album, Tidal, when she was 17, Fiona Apple was painted as an ingenue – but she dispelled any impressions that she was an innocent just as fast as she emerged. As a classically trained pianist, her acerbic, sinewy songwriting nonetheless resists convention, pulling in off-kilter percussion and woodwind to explore the outer reaches of what might otherwise be reduced to “adult contemporary”. Her singular approach to rhythm and instrumentation sometimes verges on vaudeville. But she is best-loved for her lyrics (and her voice), betraying a self-knowledge – and sometimes a bitterness – beyond her years, and honesty sometimes to a fault. “When I have something to say, I’ll say it,” she has said.The unwieldy, 90-word title of When the Pawn … is infamous, but Apple’s second album is a perfectly-formed whole, running the gamut from rage to regret in just under 45 minutes. Produced by Jon Brion, with artwork and videos by Paul Thomas Anderson (Apple’s partner at the time), it featured Apple as sole songwriter on all 10 tracks, written following her fall from favour with the music industry. Two years earlier, she had accepted the prize for best new artist at the MTV Video Music awards with a controversial speech in which she expressed her ambivalence about celebrity and called “bullshit” on the entertainment industry as a whole. It came to define her, transforming her, in her words, from a “tragic waif ethereal victim” to a “brat bitch loose cannon”.With When the Pawn ..., she returned deliberately and defiantly, on her own terms. The lurching piano of opener On the Bound sets the tone, Apple breathing nimble smoke rings in the verse (“Hell don’t know my fury”) before erupting into flames with the chorus (“You’re all I need”). Through defiance (A Mistake, Limp) and desperation (To Your Love), she comes to something approaching acceptance with I Know, her voice bruised and beautiful over brushed drum and double bass.Apple was 19 when she released her debut album, after a demo tape wound up in the hands of producer Andrew Slater via his babysitter it went on to go triple platinum. She is still best known by many for the first single, Criminal – and the controversy surrounding her state of undress in its video. Apple wrote it in less than an hour at Sony’s request for a hit. But opener Sleep to Dream – with its slumping, tumbling percussion and shimmery strings – better represents her singular style, somewhere between piano ballad and R\u0026ampB, with unflinching lyrical honesty to the fore. In 2010, proud Apple fan Kanye West identified the line, “I have never been so insulted in all my life” as his favourite first line of any song (though it is not, in fact, the first line).Apple met anticipation for her first new music in nearly a decade with her most stripped-back album yet: sparse and purposeful, with the electronic tilt to her past work notably absent. The Idler Wheel is almost a folk-country record, and finds the 34-year-old older, wiser and more ready to take responsibility for turbulence in her relationships than she had been in the past. “I could liken you to a shark the way you bit off my head  But then again, I was waving a bleeding old bone,” she admits on Werewolf, before concluding: “Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key.”After long delays, Apple’s third album made its inauspicious debut unfinished on file-sharing sites it was officially released months later and named album of the year by many outlets. Co-producer Brian Kehew has said Apple’s lack of clear vision was one factor in the hold-up (along with a micromanaging record label), and that comes across in the finished product. Extraordinary Machine is Apple’s most experimental record, as well as the most sonically rich – the opposite of what she would go on to achieve with The Idler Wheel seven years later. On Tymps (The Sick in the Head Song), every idiosyncrasy seems indulged, giving it the feel of a Disney soundtrack – or the Beatles at their most whimsical.Across the Universe (1998)The most successful of Apple’s covers, of a stylish repertoire (mostly from live sets) taking in Sinatra and Hendrix, is her take on the Beatles’ Across the Universe, recorded for the Pleasantville soundtrack in 1998. Still her second-most-streamed track on Spotify behind Criminal, it is far from a deep cut, but her take on such a familiar (and – relatively for Apple – friendly) song foregrounds the molasses quality of her voice and her distinctive approach to instrumentation. The descending woodwinds after “nothing’s gonna change my world” are especially lovely.Fiona: the caged bird sings, by Chris HeathChris Heath concluded his 1998 Rolling Stone profile, written in the thick of the fallout from the VMAs: “There is a long way to go in the Fiona Apple story.”Fiona Apple’s art of radical sensitivity, by Emily NussbaumMore than 20 years later, Emily Nussbaum picks up where Heath left off with her masterful profile of Apple at work in the New Yorker this month.Apple on griefApple’s moving letter to fans about the death of her dog, Janet, over which she cancelled a tour of South America, has been removed from Facebook, but is immortalised alongside Apple’s lyrics on Genius.• What are your favourite Fiona Apple tracks?

Now he hopes to lead his party without picking a sideWhen John Erskine signed up a teenage Keir Starmer to the Labour club at Leeds University freshers’ week in 1982, he had hoped to find a new recruit in the factional dogfight raging inside the party.But he was disappointed. Erskine recalls the young law student’s politics as being of the “non-aligned, conscience-driven left” – something like a kind of political Methodism.Instead of joining in the running battles with Militant, Starmer took the view there were “no enemies on the left” and cracked on with his studies.The overwhelming favourite to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, who steps down next weekend, Starmer has defied categorisation, declining to become a fully paid-up member of any of Labour’s many overlapping sects.He is neither a Corbynite nor a Blairite (to the extent that they still exist) and is irritated by other people’s urge to pigeon-hole him.Speaking to the  as he launched his pitch for the leadership last December, he said: “I don’t find the badging of people helps, really. I don’t need somebody else’s name tattooed on my head to know what I think. There are fundamental principles.”Starmer arrived at Leeds from Reigate grammar school, the only one of five siblings from a modest semi-detached house in Oxted, Surrey, to get to university.He has spoken movingly about his mother’s 50-year battle with Still’s disease, which ultimately led to her being confined to a wheelchair and unable to eat. “She wouldn’t have moaned. If you’d asked her how she was, she’d say ‘fine, how are you?’,” he said.After a postgraduate degree at Oxford, Starmer moved to London where he shared a rickety flat in Archway with old school friends.He joined the fashionably radical Doughty Street Chambers while carrying out pro-bono work for a string of apparently lost causes.Conor Foley, an international human rights lawyer and aid worker who now lives in Brazil, worked alongside Starmer at the campaign group Amnesty International in the 90s.The pair wrote a pamphlet, Foreign Policy, Human Rights and the UK, in 1998, making a string of recommendations, many of which were subsequently taken up by the Labour government.Tony Blair’s incorporation of the provisions of the European convention on human rights (ECHR) into UK law in the Human Rights Act catapulted Starmer and his fellow human rights lawyers from the lefty fringe of their profession to the mainstream, as the judiciary scrambled to absorb its implications.“There were various people who were, three years before, on the unacceptable left, suddenly found themselves in positions of authority,” says Conor Gearty, a professor of human rights law at the LSE and another old friend. “Because we knew about it and nobody else did.”Foley agrees. “The Human Rights Act - there are probably four or five people in Britain who got that legislation and understood the importance of that legislation, and Keir and I were two of them. There were other people who played a more prominent role. But he has always understood the strategic significance of international human rights law.”Foley says that while the pair were working together at Amnesty he didn’t sense any burning ambition in Starmer to enter party politics. “That wasn’t where we were at. I think he wanted to be a human rights lawyer. I think that was really his dream.”And anyway the Labour party of the time wasn’t much to their liking, he says. “The Blairite party wouldn’t have been something either of us were comfortable with. Not that we were anti, we just weren’t that comfortable with it.”Starmer’s appointment as director of public prosecutions (DPP) – a campaigning human rights lawyer turned the nation’s chief prosecutor – surprised some of his radical friends.Leftwing critics tend to describe his five-year stint at the top of the 6,000-strong Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) as the final stage in Starmer’s metamorphosis from firebrand QC to well-coiffed pillar of the establishment.They point to the all-night court sittings held to administer swift punishment to the 2011 rioters – which Starmer subsequently claimed had helped quell the disorder and tough prosecuting guidance that imposed sentences of up to 10 years on benefits fraudsters.A close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.Pitch\u0026nbspPromising to champion “progressive patriotism”.The Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories. A soft-left candidate, she resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 over Corbyn’s leadership and handling of the EU referendum.Pitch\u0026nbspWants to “bring Labour home” to voters that have abandoned the party in its traditional strongholds.Ambitious former director of public prosecutions has led the charge for remain in the shadow cabinet. He was instrumental in shifting Labour’s position towards backing a second referendumPitch\u0026nbspLaunched his campaign by highlighting how he has stood up for leftwing causes as a campaigning lawyer, and unveiled the slogan “Another Future is Possible”, arguing Labour can win again if we make the moral case for socialismSome inidual cases are also regularly raised, though Starmer’s friends insist they are impossible to judge without knowing what advice he received at the time.The decision not to prosecute the policeman involved in the death of Ian Tomlinson in the G20 protests was widely criticised at the time, not least by Tomlinson’s stepson, Paul King.His decision was subsequently reversed after an inquest found that Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed, but the police officer, Simon Harwood, was ultimately cleared of manslaughter in 2012.Gearty defends Starmer’s overall record at the CPS, saying he managed to forge new policy ground by developing frameworks of guidance in controversial areas such as assisted dying, alongside the traditional role of making decisions on inidual cases.“That is such a hard thing for any of us to do: to be both reactive, and also to have the capacity to be able to engage and drive the agenda.”Both of these skills should have better prepared him for life in Westminster. But his legal background hasn’t enamoured him to everyone.He was persuaded to run for parliament in 2015 in part by his longtime friend Ed Miliband, whose London home is not far up the Northern line from the Victorian terrace in Kentish Town that Starmer shares with his wife, Vicky, and two children.Labour appeared set to win, and he told his local paper, the Ham and High: “I’ve got my eyes set on winning Holborn and St Pancras and then doing whatever I can do to help a Labour government change the things that need changing.”Instead he found himself in a parliamentary party relegated to opposition and wracked with ision.During the darkest days of the Brexit drama, when Labour became embroiled in one parliamentary clash after another, Starmer was often criticised by colleagues for being too much a lawyer and not enough a politician.One shadow cabinet colleague laughingly cites his resignation as shadow immigration minister in 2016, at the later stages of the mass exodus from Jeremy Corbyn’s team in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum, as an example of his lawyerliness. “It’s a classic – you have to read it three times to see what he’s saying.”In it, Starmer said the “challenge of leadership” was different in the light of the referendum result, but that he had “maintained his support” for the embattled Corbyn until most of his team resigned. “It is simply untenable now to suggest that we can offer an effective opposition without a change of leader,” he concluded.Whatever his qualms about the leadership, Starmer made the fateful choice to go back on to the frontbench in October 2016 after Corbyn convincingly saw off Owen Smith’s challenge.In the following three years he played a crucial – and, to some colleagues, infuriating – role in inching his party towards supporting a second EU referendum.He chaired the “compositing” meeting of grassroots delegates at the 2018 conference in Liverpool that resulted in a referendum finding its way into Labour policy as an “option” that should remain “on the table”.He earned rapturous applause from the remain-supporting membership when he used his speech to drop in the idea – then anathema to the leadership – that if another poll were held, remain would have to be on the ballot paper.There followed many months of parliamentary wrangling with the Tories in public, and political clashes among Labour’s most senior figures in private.Starmer styled himself as the torchbearer for the composite – and thus for the idea that a referendum couldn’t be ruled out.In public, he stuck scrupulously to the letter of every iteration of Labour policy. But in private, says one shadow cabinet colleague, the discussions were more robust.“He stretched the case as far as he could go but not to a point where he could be said to be out of line. But in the private meetings he was pushing very much harder. At every stage, we felt, and I said this many times, this is just a fucking ratchet.”Some former MPs who lost their seats in pro-Brexit constituencies blame Starmer, in part, for the party’s policy, which took many months of wrangling to arrive at and which infuriated leave voters.He insists it was a sensible way of dealing with a deeply ided party, with a deeply ided electorate, that once arrived at was not explained or sold to the public.Certainly he made few frontline media appearances during the campaign, instead touring local constituencies to boost morale with members and candidates, a role he had also played in 2017, awarding himself the moniker Captain Marginal.Is he now more politician than lawyer? Angela Smith, the Labour leader in the House of Lords, who has sat in the shadow cabinet throughout Starmer’s time in parliament, believes so.“I don’t think anybody who’s dealt with the Labour party, the shadow cabinet, the issues that he’s dealt with over the past few years, could be accused of not being a politician,” Lady Smith says.“He’s not the kind of weirdly Machiavellian type some people associate with the word politician, but he gets the politics of an issue.”Erskine, who has watched Starmer’s progress from afar since the Leeds days, says “everything is of a piece. It’s of conscience, it’s about incredible intellectual rigour, it’s about being measured. And whilst it’s not me, I have a lot of respect for it.”That measured style until recently appeared out of political fashion. Whatever Corbyn’s shortcomings, he was capable of rousing passion in his army of supporters. Even Starmer’s most staunch supporters concede that is not really his style.One old friend recalls asking him to make a speech to a school about how he had risen from a pebble-dashed semi in Oxted to the top of his profession. It was an inspirational story, he recalls, but not an inspirational speech. “He’s no David Lammy, Keir.”Another cites what they recall as a serviceable but not outstanding address at the funeral of his predecessor in the Holborn and St Pancras seat, Frank Dobson, last December, with the great and the good of the Labour party, including four past and present leaders, in the congregation.One mourner recalls a non-plussed Labour grandee muttering afterwards: “That’s the trouble with Keir: he doesn’t rise to the occasion.”But Smith, who has seen Starmer up close over the past five years, has little sympathy for those who complain that he lacks pizzazz.“I get quite irritated when people talk about him being dull. He’s serious – and I rather like people being serious, particularly when you’re dealing with serious issues,” she says.And with politics-as-usual on hold as the world wrestles with Covid-19 and its consequences – which have already swept decades-long orthodoxies in their wake – she adds: “He’s a serious grownup politician. I think he’s the right person at the right time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbfde8dfc6100b17b163ecab0cfe9c1cd4ac2344/0_196_6048_3631/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1ba70b2a12c8a122d4cf93a5bcfd326","title":"coronavirus and volunteering how can i help in the uk","story":"From lending a hand to local charities to bolstering the efforts of the NHS, there are many ways to get involvedI want to help. Where can I find about about volunteering?There are plenty of ways to get involved. Many local charities will be keen to attract new volunteers – especially as older stalwarts are forced to stay at home. Or there are national schemes, such as NHS volunteer responders. Some bigger charities, such as the Trussell Trust food bank network, have set up their own online schemes to match volunteers with food banks in their area. Local volunteer centres and organisations such as Volunteering Matters and Do-it can link you up with charities close to where you live. Reach Volunteering will match people with specialist professional skills, such IT expertise, to charities who need their help.How do I volunteer for the NHS?The health service in England has put out a call for volunteer responders to help medical staff with tasks such as: delivering medicines from pharmacies driving patients to appointments bringing them home from hospital and making regular phone calls to check on people isolating at home. More than 500,000 people have already signed up. More details are on the NHS England website.I’ve got work and family duties, but keen to get involved. How can I help?Keeping an eye out for neighbours and family members is the simplest way to help people who are vulnerable, lonely, self-isolating or busy key workers. Help could mean anything from running errands to the shops, to providing a friendly voice of reassurance and support. Covid-19 Mutual Aid was set up to co-ordinate “good neighbour” initiatives and has lists of local groups in your area, together with details of how to help people safely.Am I allowed to volunteer under the stay at home’ rules?Yes. According to Shaun Delaney of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, exceptions to the “stay at home” guidance include people needing to travel to provide care to others. “In other words, people can go out to volunteer if they are providing help to vulnerable people or if their volunteering cannot be done from home.” If you are deemed high risk – you are aged over 70 or have underlying health issues – there are volunteering opportunities that you can do by phone or computer from home.Be sensible and vigilant. If you are helping out neighbours, please remember physical distancing rules: try to communicate by phone or text don’t enter people’s houses and always stay at least two metres away. Look after yourself, don’t go on an errand for a neighbour if you are ill or self-isolating. Wash your hands regularly.What if volunteering involves face-to-face contact?There are inescapable health risks from face-to-face volunteering and no guarantees that you will have adequate personal protective equipment. For this reason many voluntary projects, such as community kitchens and day centres, have shut down services. However, others are adapting to try to minimise the risks of infection through physical contact or close proximity. Some face-to-face befriending services, for example, have been replaced by phone or online alternatives.Will donating money to charities help?Yes. Charities both small and large have been devastated by the sudden drop in voluntary income caused by the cancellation or postponement of fundraising gatherings, ranging from fetes and coffee mornings to the London marathon. Those with high street retail outlets have also been hit by shop closures. UK charities estimate they will lose over £4bn over the next few weeks. Without cash, thousands of charities, including hospices, health and social care, and cancer support charities will be forced to reduce services, or in some cases even close down.Where should I donate to help the coronavirus support effort?The immediate focus is on charities that can provide emergency frontline support to vulnerable people affected by the social impact of coronavirus, including food banks and care organisations helping older, isolated and disabled people and their families. There are more than 14 million people living on the breadline in the UK, and they will be badly hit by the economic crisis caused by Covid-19. Other organisations that need help include those providing welfare advice and emotional and respite support.How can I ensure my money is getting to the frontline?One of the safest ways of giving is donate to the National Emergencies Trust. This charity is co-ordinating the UK coronavirus disaster voluntary relief effort, providing a single online portal for donations from iniduals and companies. The money will be rapidly distributed in the form of small grants to recognised local charities via 46 established regional community foundations covering the whole of the UK.

The world is in a very tough place right now but I just think: ‘I’ve been here before, in a very dark place. This is how my life has been for a long time.”Chamberlain’s latest spell of solitude has been enforced by coronavirus, which led to the inevitable cancellation of Saturday’s bill in Coventry. His return was meant to be screened live on Channel 5. A second fight, on 25 April in London, has also been abandoned and so the Brixton cruiserweight has been consigned again to the wilderness.Seventeen months have passed since Chamberlain’s last bout, a victory over Luke Watkins that helped ease the pain of his only defeat in the ring, on points to his bitter rival Lawrence Okolie in February 2018. His comeback has been derailed by a series of disasters. A family member stole £10,000 from his O2-headlining purse for fighting Okolie while subsequent fights in America were cancelled and Chamberlain was let down by jailed promoters and wayward trainers.The boxer has spent much of the past four months in a brutal Miami training camp, from where he has written regularly to me about his struggle to cope. When we first met in person, in November, Chamberlain emerged as a vibrant and engaging character who is also capable of deep introspection. He writes long and riveting insights into his psychology that sometimes left me worrying about his mental health. But he reassured me that writing is a way of controlling his torment.“It just makes me feel better, bro,” he told me, “and I like to write.”I still found it striking that a boxer, who had once been an 11-year-old coerced into carrying drugs in south London while boys just a little older than him were stabbed to death, wrote with such sensitivity and eloquence.“Hell is a perception,” Chamberlain wrote last November. “Or perhaps it’s a nightmare. What’s hell to you could be mediocre to someone else. For some people fighting is hell to them. For me, inactivity has caused me more depression and made me drown in my own perception of hell … I’m not talking about the physical and what you can see. I’m talking about something much more detrimental and lingering. The hell in your mind. It makes you feel crazy to be you. I honestly can’t stand the quiet whistling sound that I hear, when it’s silent in my room and it’s pitch black, as I’m writing this at 5:18am.”On 11 December he sent me a photo of a single bed in a stark room. “We go again,” Chamberlain wrote. “I’m in Miami now. 5,000 miles from home. Away from friends, family and loved ones. Alone. Rottweilers are barking outside. The dawn quickly turns to darkness. And reality sets in … ”A few weeks later, Chamberlain messaged me: “This wasn’t the 2019 I wanted, but it was character building. I’m in the ground now, buried. Sitting in my room on Christmas Day. But I will rise. Deep down an undeniable force is driving my actions. I must embrace it.”On 4 January, after moving into a hostel in Miami, Chamberlain sent me a photograph of him in a white vest standing against a grimy bunk bed. “In prison,” he wrote.His messages over the next eight weeks were much more cheerful. Chamberlain confirmed that he had signed a five-year deal with the British promoter Mick Hennessy, who steered Carl Froch and Tyson Fury to their first world titles. His upbeat mood continued as he spoke enthusiastically about how much it would mean to be back in the ring again. When I texted him news of my plan to write about him for the  he replied: ‘Amazing my brooooooo … ”But then, on 17 March, he attached the official news that both his fights were off and that there would be no boxing for many months. Chamberlain is back in Britain but, as the lockdown intensifies, we have to do this interview remotely. I can hear the breath catch in his throat when I ask how he felt after he received the crushing, if hardly surprising, news. “I was fighting back tears on the train, trying not to show anyone I was so upset. I was thinking, ‘What more do I need to do? Why, just when I have my big break, does this happen?’ But almost straightaway I told myself, ‘Let’s not be selfish here. The coronavirus is affecting everyone. It’s bigger than me. Other people are suffering more than me.’”Chamberlain sighs. “But you’re fighting with your mind because you think how different it should have been. In my last week of sparring I was knocking guys out. I was that ready I was knocking guys out with 20oz gloves. I was destroying them.”“Before, I was going through so much shit on my own. Now I have these people around me, consoling me, saying, ‘Don’t worry, Isaac. We’ve got you. It’s going to be OK.’ It feels good for someone else to pick you up. It’s not me picking myself up all the time.“I also still feel really excited about the Hennessy deal. All their shows are free-to-air TV. There’s a gap in the market because you can utilise that free audience of about three million viewers on average. Imagine if I turn it into four or five million viewers? That would be massive. I’m charismatic. I can talk. I can fight. People were coming to see me because I was starting to sell both venues out.”When does Hennessy expect boxing to resume? “He said: ‘I’ve spoken to some very important people. I think the next show will probably be in September.’ I thought, ‘Fucking hell …. six months.’ But then I calmed down. I just need to keep in good shape. It was so hard in Miami, so it’s time for a little rest.”Chamberlain seems better equipped than many people to adjust to the lockdown. “Everyone is talking about isolation and how they’re struggling. Well, I’ve been isolated in Miami for months. I was isolated from hope or any guarantee. It was hard but I got through it. I remember when I came back from Miami the time before this one I was so weak. I hadn’t spoken to anyone for so long. I was really isolated. When people recognised me and friends spoke to me I thought, ‘Oh, crap.’ Now it’s different.”“We grew up in Brixton and my cousin, Alex Mulumba, got stabbed in the heart after he’d passed his GCSEs. It was a very sad time for the family. My mum brought me to the boxing gym because she didn’t want me going down that road. I had started to become a product of the environment, hanging around those types of people. A lot of my friends from that time are dead or in prison on life sentences.“As soon as I got into the gym, it was euphoria. I was like, ‘What is this? People hitting each other. This stuff is normal?’ It was crazy, the sweaty gym walls and the stinky gloves. I loved it. I would be in there all day, every day. I’m the type of person, especially as a kid, that if I liked something I would be obsessed with it. I’m still like that. I’ll just keep training hard even though I wouldn’t know where my career was going.“The thing I loved most about boxing was that it lifted me up. I’d never had those words of encouragement. People were saying, ‘You could be a champion.’ I was like, ‘Shit, these people think I can be something.’ I’d never had that from teachers, not from my mum, not from anyone. I kept coming back so I could hear those words again because it felt so good. So boxing saved my life, big time.”Despite the worrying and surreal times, Chamberlain sounds strong. I also point out that he has not been writing. “That’s because I’m not depressed. I only write when things are getting on top of me. I’m still very optimistic.“I still feel I will become a world champion. The world title belt I want is the WBC one. It’s beautiful and it’s my phone wallpaper. I look at it when I wake up and before I go to sleep. The current champion is Ilunga Makabu, from the Congo, and if we fight I’ll destroy him. The cruiserweights out there are getting old and I don’t think they’re that good.”He laughs softly and then, as is his way, Chamberlain offers fresh hope all over again. “It’s true. Whatever you’re going through, you can get past it. If you feel you’re in hell right now, why would you stay there? That’s why it’s very important to keep going and keep pushing, no matter what life throws at you. That’s exactly what I’m doing. Keep working, keep believing, and you will come through it. I’m a living testament to that. We can all get through this time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79856aad571916c8f97bddd9f95f1480aa35ddf1/0_78_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dc053f60739a8a099d6e0a61148a0bf","title":"open moves closer to postponement as ra looks at 2020 reschedule","story":"The R\u0026ampA is understood to be edging closer to a postponement of the Open Championship, amid a growing realisation golf’s oldest major cannot be held in July at Royal St George’s. An announcement could be made following talks next week, with the Open’s organisers hopeful of rescheduling the tournament for later in the year as a backup plan.With the Masters and US PGA Championship already postponed, the US Open and Open are the two men’s majors left in their designated spots. The US Open is due to start on 18 June at Winged Foot in New York, and reports in the United States suggest an unsurprising postponement is imminent.With more than 200,000 spectators due to attend the Open, which runs from 16-19 July, there is a rising sense the coronavirus pandemic won’t have settled sufficiently for the tournament to be staged in satisfactory form for players or fans. The Open clearly falls under “mass gathering” criteria, with issues relating to international travel also pertinent.The R\u0026ampA’s contingency has been the topic for deep discussion at high levels in recent days. Weather and light restrictions would theoretically leave September as the last month in which the tournament can be played. This year is the 149th playing of the Open, with the 150th scheduled for the home of golf, St Andrews, next July. With that in mind, the organisers are anxious to hold their major this year. Any extended schedule delays could impact on Royal Liverpool and Royal Troon, which have already been confirmed as venues for 2022 and 2023.The R\u0026ampA pointed towards their statement of last Thursday when asked for an update on the Open. In it, the chief executive, Martin Slumbers, said: “Our absolute priority is to ensure the safety of players, fans, officials, staff and all involved in our championships and that will be at the forefront of our thinking as we monitor developments.”It was announced on Friday that the Evian Championship, another women’s major, has been rescheduled for 6-9 August from 23-26 July. The August window was originally intended for the women’s Olympic golf tournament, before the 2020 Tokyo Games were postponed. It is thought the PGA of America also hopes to play the US PGA Championship, originally set for May, from 6 August at Harding Park in San Francisco.The former US Ryder Cup captain Davis Love and his wife escaped without injury after their home in Georgia was burnt down early on Friday morning. “While everyone in our family is saddened at the loss of our home that was filled with so much laugher and incredible memories, we’re very blessed that everyone is safe and unharmed,” said Love."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1360ac4e5c1fcb2be3e5f9c29e58b03889df5fd/0_52_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26c97678c6b469afe664feddbfdf3f70","title":"richard parks ski antarctica world record adventurers grand slam","story":"After a successful rugby career, including four appearances for Wales, Parks is now a world record holder in endurance skiingAs each of us languishes in isolation, one man is about to enter the Guinness Book of World Records for being on his own. When the next edition of every aspirant child’s bible comes out later this year, Richard Parks will be included for skiing more miles (2,299) in Antarctica, solo, unassisted and unsupported, than anyone else.If geographical isolation is the measure, no one has been lonelier. And yet over the phone in our new reality he can be heard handling the demands of his two-year-old son, Freddie, with aplomb, even as he handles those of this interviewer on the other end of the line.“Speaking frankly,” he says, when asked whether isolation is easier with wife and child in a flat in Cardiff Bay or on his own in the sprawling, frozen wilderness, “there are pros and cons. Every moment of every expedition I wish I was able to share it with my family and friends. It seems this cruel twist of fate has now landed us with exactly that wish. Managing the space together poses its own challenges. The other day I found Jo, who holds a pretty senior position, working in Freddie’s treehouse on the balcony in the flat.”Parks’s relationship with isolation is long and poignant. Forged in the boisterous rough and tumble of professional rugby, he was plunged into turmoil when his career, which included four caps for Wales, was cut short by a shoulder injury in 2009. In his award-winning autobiography, Beyond the Horizon, he describes how he retreated into the bare, white room at the back of the house his parents were renting. Crippled by despair and fear, he holed up for 21 days, emerging from the room only for the toilet and, from the house, for an operation on his ruined shoulder.“That first period of isolation was really painful,” he says. “I felt at sea with nothing to hold on to. I was completely powerless – over my emotions, over what had happened, the injury. That was terrifying, right. I can imagine there might be people going through feelings related to that now.”A line from his grandmother’s funeral two years earlier – “the horizon is only the limit of our sight” – had resonated so deeply he had it tattooed on his forearm. While staring at it in that white room, he was struck by an epiphany. His horizons had closed in, but thenceforth he would embrace the brilliant whiteness of mountains, wildernesses and the unknown, where the horizon stretches farther than anywhere else on earth.He launched himself into his new vocation, acquiring the skills of a mountaineer with remarkable facility. In 2011, he became the first to stand, in the same calendar year, at the highest peak of each of the seven continents and at the North and South Pole, known as the adventurers’ grand slam. He managed the feat in six and a half months.Since then, he has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity and worked with scientists as a kind of guinea pig at the extremes of human endeavour. But his current world record is not the one he had been seeking in his four expeditions to Antarctica, the first a training run in late 2012. Parks has been chasing a world record they say will never be broken.In 2011, his friend Christian Eide of Norway skied the 715 miles from Hercules Inlet on the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole in an astonishing 24 days, smashing the previous record of 39. The reason no one expects it to be broken is that the conditions were perfect throughout. Good weather is not something to rely upon in Antarctica, the driest, windiest and coldest continent.Parks, in that sunny Antarctic summer of 2011, was on the first two legs of his adventurer’s grand slam and testifies the weather has deteriorated since, becoming snowier, wetter and warmer. Despite the conditions, in 2014, he became the second-fastest skier to the South Pole, in a time of 29 days.The magnitude of the challenge beggars belief. A month’s worth of supplies and equipment must be hauled on a sled weighing roughly 70kg, as the challenger skis uphill from the coast to the Antarctic plateau, 3,000m above sea level, the height of an average Alp.Parks expended the calorific equivalent of two marathons a day in the most hostile environment on earth. Forced to abandon his second record attempt last year, because of even worse weather than usual, this year he skied for 16 hours a day, and slept for three, as he lowered his British record to 28 days in January. At halfway he was on course to break Eide’s world record. Then, sure enough, the weather turned, the wind howling at him from the pole with a chill factor of -45 degrees. By the time he finished, he had lost 14.5kg.“I’m genuinely at peace with it,” he says of the knowledge the speed record seems out of reach in the current climate. “There are some things I can’t control. That’s what makes this different from mainstream sport. And there’s a beauty in that.”He has not decided whether to try again. For now, the kind of isolation we are all wrestling with is preoccupying him more. “For any given expedition, there is years of preparation and training. With the current situation, we didn’t have that luxury. So we are all going through something akin to the grief curve.”Identifying and honouring what he can and cannot control is Parks’s mantra. Through it, he has transformed isolation from the scourge of his very soul to the field in which he is now a world-record holder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b342770cc517b166d4dcfbd87ead3daa7a34c4/0_40_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c965e631496a917055e368beaf317769","title":"rugby league world cup key workers 20021 free tickets england","story":"Frontline staff will be thanked for their dedication during the coronavirus pandemic at the tournament in England next yearBy Gavin Willacy for No Helmets RequiredThe decision to move the Olympics and the European Championship to 2021 could have Jon Dutton panicking. He is the CEO in charge of delivering the Rugby League World Cup in England next year, but he is staying calm using his position to reach out and thank the people doing the most for the country right now.Can you explain why you are giving away 20,021 free World Cup tickets to key workers? “Because those frontline workers are doing such wonderful work across the country right now. It’s our way of saying thank you. Their work, effort, dedication and sheer determination needs to be recognised. Hopefully we can provide these local heroes and their families with something to look forward to next year. We wanted 2,021 volunteers for the World Cup but in 48 hours we had over 5,000 register. We’ve asked them all to support the Covid-19 efforts in their own communities. Our legacy projects include work on loneliness and dementia, so those are even more important issues now.”How is coronavirus delaying your World Cup plans? “We were ready to announce the sequence of fixtures and the venues but it’s no longer practical to stick with our original timeline. At the moment we’re working on announcing team bases and a new brand with one logo that will represent the three tournaments – men’s, women’s and wheelchair – on 11 June, 500 days before the opening game at Newcastle. Then pre-sale of tickets in September and the ballot opening on 23 October, a year to the day before the opening match. We’ll revisit this if we need to. We were in talks with broadcasters to confirm kick-off times, but all that could change. It’s being dictated by other people, not us.”How worried are you by the Olympics and Euros moving to 2021? “We see it as a real opportunity, not a threat. They can be celebrations that we have come through this. World Cups bring togetherness, joy and inspiration and provide memories that can last a lifetime. And we’re in a stronger position than most: we have time on our side, a small staff, a low cost base and we’ve done a lot of planning already.”What concerns have you over the broadcast deals?“We’re having conversations with the BBC but we’re at a quite wonderful place in that they’re committed to showing every minute of every game – men’s, women’s and wheelchair tournaments – across the BBC, all 62 games. They may be impacted by the Olympics and Paralympics moving to next year, but their commitment remains firm.”If the NRL decides to play into November 2021, could the World Cup still go ahead? “Probably not. A scaled-down tournament is not really feasible. We expect two-thirds of the players in the men’s tournament to come from the NRL. We want the very best athletes in the world to be there.”Would you consider pushing the World Cup back to 2022? “No, for many reasons, one of them being the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. It has to be in October-November 2021. We’ll start conversations with venues about availability and player welfare to ensure the players get an appropriate break.”Given that 12 of the 18 venues are football stadiums – including Old Trafford, Anfield, the Emirates, St James’ Park and Elland Road – what concerns do you have about their availability? “No one has said ‘no’ to hosting teams and neither have any of the venues, but we don’t know what the future holds. Any disruption to the Premier League or Championship may have an impact on us – and so would changes to the Champions League or Europa League. We’re at the back of the queue.”What if Australia cancel the Ashes this autumn? “It would be a real blow as we need it as a marketing tool for 2021. We’ll wait patiently for decisions from the RFL and Australian Rugby League Commission. We don’t know what England are going to do yet. We do know that we’re planning for the warm-up games to be connected and harnessed to lead into the World Cup.”The decision on who will host the 2025 World Cup is due next year. Would England step in and host it again? “Absolutely not. If it should go ahead as planned, it won’t be here.”Follow No Helmets Required on Twitter and Facebook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39c510d50227249488bfe3b804fd0c732d43c17d/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d9697bf85fcdc8d9a01396b869a633b","title":"the breadwinners of barishal how women in bangladesh are starting their own businesses","story":"Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suitby  Thaslima Begum in BarishalIn the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.She uses the money to pay for her children’s education and managed to save enough to buy a small TV, which kept her busy during the World Cup. “Everyone here loves football, so I thought it would be a good investment,” she says proudly. “Not everyone in the slums owns a TV, so when they stop to watch, they also buy tea.”Married at 12, Rina now has five children and is the sole breadwinner of her family. Her husband suffered a stroke seven years ago and is no longer able to work. “I had no money to feed my children. I’d already taken out loans and was worried about our financial situation.” But in 2018, she received a small grant, which enabled her to kickstart her own business.Rina’s customers are mostly men labourers who come to drink chai during their breaks and catch up with their friends. Though they don’t speak to Rina much, she has learned a lot from listening in on their conversations. “They discuss everything – sports, politics, economics and the weather – information I never had access to while sitting at home.”Knowledge about the weather is particularly important for Rina as flooding hampers her business. “When the water comes in, people aren’t interested in sitting around drinking tea.”As she buys her tea wholesale, grown in north-eastern districts such as Sylhet, it’s important for Rina to know of incoming natural disasters that might affect her supply, so that she can plan ahead.Mahmuda, 36, has just had a baby and is making plans on how to balance her tailoring business with motherhood. After receiving a small business loan, Mahmuda was able to establish her tailoring business, which has been going from strength to strength. Dressed in a traditional shalwar kameez she made herself, Mahmuda gently rocks baby Diya back and forth.After going into labour early and losing a lot of blood, the doctors thought both mother and baby wouldn’t make it. Mahmuda was able to use the money she generated from her business to pay for hospital fees and basic necessities for her premature baby.“My business is slowly expanding, and I am able to feed my children,” she says. Mahmuda buys materials and sews clothes for the women in her community. She recently bought a wardrobe to safely store her clothing and protect it from flooding and the smell of the draining system outside her home.Mahmuda lives with her baby and two young sons, sick husband and elderly mother – all of whom she supports financially. Her father left when she was small, so Mahmuda’s mother raised her on her own. She is happy to now be able to take care of her in return. “I am also able to maintain my sons’ educational expenses, which I couldn’t do before – it was a real struggle to pay their tuition fees every month.”Every morning, before the sun rises, Mukhal, 28, sets off on a small dinghy to the local fish market. Dressed in a black burka and face veil so as not to draw attention, Mukhal is one of the few women who can be found in a market mostly dominated by men. Over time she has been able to develop her negotiation skills, so she gets a better price for the catch. She then fills her basket and carries it back to her village, where she sells the fish to her neighbours.Mukhal has led a difficult life. Forced into marriage at the age of 12 when her father died, she became pregnant at 15, and was beaten then abandoned by her husband who took another wife. Her home is on the banks of the river and prone to flooding. “Everything I do is for my son. My only hope is to be the best mother that I can be. I don’t want my son to live this kind of life – I want him to be educated and to have a good job. He wants to be an engineer! I work hard to pay for his education, so he doesn’t have to struggle like me.”Also driven by a strong desire to help her family, Chompa, 15, currently works in an electronics factory. Her father was a rickshaw puller, but because of his old age and the flooding from heavy rain, such arduous work has become difficult. So Chompa is now the main breadwinner in her family, spending all day at a factory where she uses her small hands to put together electronic goods destined for faraway places worlds she catches brief glimpses of through the TV screens that she helps assemble.Chompa earns approximately 4,000 taka (£36.30) a month, which she puts towards rent, food and her parents’ medicines. But a few months ago, while building a fan, it suddenly switched on and the blades sliced off three of her fingers. “There was blood everywhere,” she says. “After a few seconds, I passed out.” Though the factory covered her hospital bill, and at this time she is still receiving her monthly salary, a future without able hands feels uncertain – she says she is likely to be downgraded or dismissed from her role.“What can I expect from this life?” she asks. “I have many dreams, but there are no opportunities.” She wishes she could attend school, but like many young girls from Barishal, this isn’t always an option. One day, when she is old enough, Chompa wants to own a business. She has seen the examples of other women in her community achieving success providing her with glimmers of hope that another reality is not only possible, it is within reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c0bc9bc0c2cfc8701c78a3201d01ab4b1aad301/33_543_8122_4873/master/8122.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e75a59073bc6d0890f539662b4174a","title":"mehdi hasan interview","story":"The political interviewer on how he made it in the US and his anger at the deference the media has for Donald Trump which could cost lives during the pandemic‘We all know that the president is a pathological liar,” Mehdi Hasan says from his office in Washington DC. “But the lies he’s been telling about the coronavirus – they’re no joke they cost American lives. The US media’s failure to call Donald Trump out on those lies in real time makes part of the media, I’m sorry to say, partly complicit in those deaths, too.” Hasan, who moved from the UK to the US in 2015, is that rare species of TV interviewer: not in it to make friends, to network or to gain access. His passion for grilling his subjects is only matched by his frustration at his peers who do not do the same.When the White House press corps turned on the comedian Michelle Wolf after the 2018 White House correspondents’ dinner and defended Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, it was the last straw for him. In that moment, he realised that the US media is almost “irredeemable”.“If not now, when?” he asks. “If they’re not going to stand up against this administration’s secretary, then who?” A credulous New York Times headline in the wake of the 2019 El Paso shooting, “Trump Urges Unity vs Racism”, was, to him, just another stitch in the pattern of this submission. “The American press doesn’t want to rock the boat, and so things are just reported straight.”Such forthrightness has served Hasan well. Not only have his hard-hitting political interviews become regular viral hits, he has also become a fixture on the high-profile US cable news circuit. Rumours are beginning to circulate on the east coast about offers to host his own show on a US network. On such approaches he is coyly amused when I ask him, maintaining only that he very much loves his job at the moment.As an interviewer, he is relentless, a quality that boosted his profile after Trump came to office and the US media seemed unable to land a glove on the new president or his surrogates. As a columnist for the online magazine the Intercept and the host of UpFront and Head to Head on Al Jazeera English, Hasan has developed a reputation for somehow managing to nail dissimulating politicians by being forensic and refusing to move on until his point is made. His technique is simple. “Most people ask the question and move on whether they get an answer or not,” he says. “I don’t.”Hasan, 40, was already a successful journalist in the UK when he moved to the US to host an interview show for Al Jazeera English. An established pundit and political analyst with a erse journalistic background, he has worked in TV at Sky News and Channel 4, co-authored a book about Ed Miliband, and served stints as the political editor of the New Statesman and political director of the Huffington Post UK. For all that it seems like a charmed career, Hasan describes it as “random”. He started out on the bottom rung as a freelance news assistant at ITN and puts his success down to those “willing to take a chance” on him.But it was in the US where he really began to cut through. Clips of his Al Jazeera English interviews began to catch fire online. A clash with the Trump adviser and Fox News regular Steven Rogers in November 2018 heralded Hasan’s arrival in the mainstream. In it, he questions Rogers on Trump’s lies on birth right citizenship, among other falsehoods. Rogers starts out with bluster before quickly squirming and deflating under Hasan’s barrage.To date, a clip of the interview in which Hasan pummels Rogers has had almost 8m views on Twitter alone. It brought him to the attention of Seth Myers, who, when interviewing Hasan, called the Rogers interrogation “the template for talking to people within the Trump-sphere”. Hasan has recently also developed a following among Hollywood stars with an activist bent. Mark Ruffalo tweeted the Rogers interview saying: “There is such thing as the truth, even today. This is how a journalist does their job to uncover it.”But despite the rough edges, he is a public school boy, and he admits that the confidence his private schooling and Oxford education (he studied that favourite of future prime ministers, Politics, Philosophy and Economics), has been invaluable in compensating for the fact that there are very few people like him in the British or US media. The “outsiderness” was from being a Muslim and the son of immigrants.Even in the US, he says, the interviews that create a buzz are those by British interviewers: Emily Maitliss talking to Sean Spicer, or Andrew Neil to rightwing controversialist Ben Shapiro. “Shapiro lives on US TV, not just on Fox, on CNN, on Bill Maher and all sorts of shows. Why did it take Andrew Neil to come along and poke holes in the complete facade of Ben Shapiro? There’s a culture of deference not just to people in power, it’s the politeness. You have to get in people’s faces.”It is something he advises British journalists to do with Johnson, for whom Hasan interned at the Spectator, when the now prime minister was the magazine’s editor. He recalls a genial and polite Johnson, but remembers how the “untucking of the shirt and the ruffling of the hair” was clearly a deliberate act before meetings. While he does not believe that Johnson is as bad as Trump (who he says is “unique’ in his pathologies), he sees the danger of Johnson’s populism and the media’s complicity in both creating him and continuing to be soft on him. “I use the L-word, ‘lie’, I use the R-word, ‘racism’. In the Trump era, you have to be able to use these words. In the Brexit era, you have to be able to use these words. And there’s still a real shyness and reluctance for journalists to do that.”Hasan’s righteousness is infectious, but it has not always served him well. A zealous address he made over a decade ago to a Muslim congregation in the UK has cast a long shadow. The remarks are recycled and used against him by his opponents on a regular basis. His observations, caught on camera, on non-Muslims (“cattle”), homosexuals and atheists, are hard to style out. He has addressed these comments often, most recently on Twitter, where he said: “Like a lot of journos (humans?) I’ve said things years ago that I now deeply regret.”When I ask him about this, he is prepared. “Dumb comments,” he says. But his contrition is laced with a defiance, because he believes that non-Muslims are not held to account in the same way. “Boris Johnson’s comments haven’t stopped him from being prime minister, ones he hasn’t even disowned. Why?” he asks. “Because I’m Muslim there’s no debate about that.”His argument is borne out by an incident last July when Marco Rubio posted a clip of a 2018 Hasan interview with Ilhan Omar, aggressively edited to make her appear racist against white people. “It increases abuse and death threats to her, and to me. I wish I could switch off,” he says. The political climate in the US is one of constant threat to public figures such Omar and himself.Despite the prejudice and scrutiny that he says he and other Muslims and minorities in the public eye face, he sees a counterintuitive solidarity with Muslims developing in the US. Trump has been so nakedly Islamophobic and xenophobic that it has pushed “many people off the fence”, he thinks. The “silver lining” is that the open season on Muslims and immigrants has created a group of Trump’s opponents that is happy to support them. Hasan’s American experience is of a country that is becoming less Islamophobic and less anti-immigration, even as Trump’s Islamophobic rhetoric intensifies. He maintains that he has been embraced warmly by many in the US media, and is often asked for interview tips.When talking about this welcome, an earnestness and warmth creeps into his voice. Hasan has clearly been on a journey over the past few years, and when he talks about what really drives him, the professional interlocutor tenor, which sometimes feels like a hammer dropping relentlessly on an anvil, changes to a softer tone. “Fundamentally it’s about one thing, it’s about avoiding the dehumanisation of other people,” he says. “The No 1 issue in my lifetime right now is tribalism. I’m going to be there for human rights and civil rights. When I see the stuff I said in my 20s, across the board should I have been more careful? Yes. Because you cannot speak about people in sweeping terms. That is the No 1 lesson of life.”That, however, doesn’t mean he holds back on sweeping terms when criticising the rest of the US media. Despite his success, Hasan’s style of journalism is in the minority. The media “gave Trump a free pass in 2015”, he frets, and Trump’s ongoing bigotry is still treated with “both sides” equivocation. “My biggest worry, frustration, regret, annoyance, is that they don’t seem to have learned many lessons and we seem to be going down the same path for 2020.”The media’s handling of Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic has given Hasan little reassurance. “When the president turns up at the White House briefing room and falsely claims there’ll be 5m tests within a month or that Google will be involved in the testing or that people are being tested at airports coming into the country, isn’t it shameful that even now, no reporter stands up and says: ‘Mr President, why should we believe a damn word you say?’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a62889d8e84ed1f44a195a5e2e2abe350737c70/0_31_2125_1275/master/2125.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b308ac851bd916a8c9473d0a0ec7d3f","title":"lockdown tv which show would you like to rewatch with us","story":"As the coronavirus pandemic stops us from enjoying our favourites with our friends and family, come watch a classic from the BBC, ITV or Channel 4 with usLong gone are the days when the idiot box was seen as a solitary activity that rots your brain.

We watch you as you behave just as we did. You hold the same arguments we did until a short time ago, between those who still say “it’s only a flu, why all the fuss?” and those who have already understood.As we watch you from here, from your future, we know that many of you, as you were told to lock yourselves up into your homes, quoted Orwell, some even Hobbes. But soon you’ll be too busy for that.First of all, you’ll eat. Not just because it will be one of the few last things that you can still do.You’ll find dozens of social networking groups with tutorials on how to spend your free time in fruitful ways. You will join them all, then ignore them completely after a few days.You’ll pull apocalyptic literature out of your bookshelves, but will soon find you don’t really feel like reading any of it.You’ll eat again. You will not sleep well. You will ask yourselves what is happening to democracy.You’ll have an unstoppable online social life – on Messenger, WhatsApp, Skype, Zoom…You will miss your adult children like you never have before the realisation that you have no idea when you will ever see them again will hit you like a punch in the chest.Old resentments and falling-outs will seem irrelevant. You will call people you had sworn never to talk to ever again, so as to ask them: “How are you doing?” Many women will be beaten in their homes.You will wonder what is happening to all those who can’t stay home because they don’t have one. You will feel vulnerable when going out shopping in the deserted streets, especially if you are a woman. You will ask yourselves if this is how societies collapse. Does it really happen so fast? You’ll block out these thoughts and when you get back home you’ll eat again.You will put on weight. You’ll look for online fitness training.You’ll laugh. You’ll laugh a lot. You’ll flaunt a gallows humour you never had before. Even people who’ve always taken everything dead seriously will contemplate the absurdity of life, of the universe and of it all.You will make appointments in the supermarket queues with your friends and lovers, so as to briefly see them in person, all the while abiding by the social distancing rules.You will count all the things you do not need.The true nature of the people around you will be revealed with total clarity. You will have confirmations and surprises.Literati who had been omnipresent in the news will disappear, their opinions suddenly irrelevant some will take refuge in rationalisations which will be so totally lacking in empathy that people will stop listening to them. People whom you had overlooked, instead, will turn out to be reassuring, generous, reliable, pragmatic and clairvoyant.Those who invite you to see all this mess as an opportunity for planetary renewal will help you to put things in a larger perspective. You will also find them terribly annoying: nice, the planet is breathing better because of the halved CO2 emissions, but how will you pay your bills next month?You will not understand if witnessing the birth of a new world is more a grandiose or a miserable affair.You will play music from your windows and lawns. When you saw us singing opera from our balconies, you thought “ah, those Italians”. But we know you will sing uplifting songs to each other too. And when you blast I Will Survive from your windows, we’ll watch you and nod just like the people of Wuhan, who sung from their windows in February, nodded while watching us.Many of you will fall asleep vowing that the very first thing you’ll do as soon as lockdown is over is file for orce.Many children will be conceived.Your children will be schooled online. They’ll be horrible nuisances they’ll give you joy.Elderly people will disobey you like rowdy teenagers: you’ll have to fight with them in order to forbid them from going out, to get infected and die.You will try not to think about the lonely deaths inside the ICU.You’ll want to cover with rose petals all medical workers’ steps.You will be told that society is united in a communal effort, that you are all in the same boat. It will be true. This experience will change for good how you perceive yourself as an inidual part of a larger whole.Class, however, will make all the difference. Being locked up in a house with a pretty garden or in an overcrowded housing project will not be the same. Nor is being able to keep on working from home or seeing your job disappear. That boat in which you’ll be sailing in order to defeat the epidemic will not look the same to everyone nor is it actually the same for everyone: it never was.At some point, you will realise it’s tough. You will be afraid. You will share your fear with your dear ones, or you will keep it to yourselves so as not to burden them with it too.You will eat again.We’re in Italy, and this is what we know about your future. But it’s just small-scale fortune-telling. We are very low-key seers.If we turn our gaze to the more distant future, the future which is unknown both to you and to us too, we can only tell you this: when all of this is over, the world won’t be the same."},{"url":null,"title":"anywhere but westminster we need your help covering the coronavirus","story":"For our second episode we want to focus on work, and what the Covid-19 outbreak has done to it.

FRP Advisory, the restructuring specialist, confirmed it was working with the chain, which has 73 branches and about 2,000 employees.The firm said in a statement: “FRP is working with the directors of Carluccio’s to consider all options for the company in the current climate.”Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.The restaurant chain was founded by the late chef Antonio Carluccio in 1999. The plan to call in administrators, first reported by Sky News, follows a difficult period for casual dining chains, with tough competition and rising costs.In 2018, Carluccio’s landlords backed a restructuring plan in the form of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), an insolvency procedure that allowed it to shutter loss-making sites, and led to the closure of about 30 of its restaurants.Carluccio’s is controlled by the Landmark Group, the Dubai-based retail and hospitality conglomerate. At the time of the CVA, it promised to finance a multimillion-pound refurbishment for the restaurants unaffected by the CVA.Meanwhile, the rent-to-own firm BrightHouse, which has been accused of overcharging, will collapse into administration on Monday, putting 2,400 jobs at risk.The company – which sells household appliances and electrical goods on credit to primarily low-income customers – has been teetering on the brink for months after a regulatory crackdown on interest charges that reduced its income, but was tipped into failure by the economic stresses of the coronavirus outbreak.BrightHouse said costly compensation claims by customers after the crackdown were costing it £1m every month.It is understood that tentative restructuring plans were scrapped as the pandemic gained pace. The company – which is owned by a trio of investment funds, Alteri, Apollo and Highbridge – is expected to appoint Grant Thornton as administrators within days.Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, rising costs and broader economic problems as well as unseasonable weather. In the past few years names such as Mothercare, Karen Millen, Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld have disappeared from the UK high street as a result.In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. Companies such as Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.\u0026nbspAt the same time, there is a move away from buying stuff as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Uncertainty about the economy has also slowed the housing market and linked makeovers of homes. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.Retailers with a high street presence want the government to change business rates to even up the tax burden with online players and to adapt more quickly to the rapidly changing market. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no-deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs at the end of this year. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges, which they say put off shoppers.Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas – which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further potential Brexit wobbles to come – retailers are facing another tough year in 2020. The latest rise in the national minimum wage in April will also add to costs and hit profits. On the plus side, there are hopes of a boost to the housing market from increased certainty about Brexit after the general election. There are also signs that the shift to online shopping is slowing, potentially easing the pressure on high streets.A spokesman for BrightHouse said: “The national response to the Covid-19 pandemic has required us to prioritise the health and wellbeing of our staff and customers, in particular by closing all stores in the last few days. While we continue to actively engage with our stakeholders, these developments have made the task of finding a future for BrightHouse more challenging.”The company’s collapse will probably mean its 240 stores – which have been closed since last week – will disappear from the high street and leave thousands of staff unemployed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab5882c4b298aadd2add925ba7d64239a81cc212/0_187_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffe847d9fc1a25cdd165e815ca3da649","title":"china prepares to seal itself off from the world to stem imported coronavirus cases","story":"Phonecall between leaders came as China prepares to seal itself off from the world to stem ‘imported’ coronavirus casesChinese president Xi Jinping has called on Donald Trump to take “substantive actions” to improve relations between the two countries, as China prepared to shut its borders to foreign arrivals amid fears of infections coming from abroad.On Friday, Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping held a phone call about the coronavirus outbreak in an attempt to repair strained relations, following weeks of traded barbs over the virus. According to state media, Xi told Trump in a phone call on Friday that US-China relations had reached an “important juncture”.“Working together brings both sides benefits, fighting hurts both. Cooperation is the only choice,” he said. Xi said he hoped the US would take “substantive actions” to improve US-China relations to develop a relationship that is “without conflict and confrontation” but based on “mutual respect and mutually beneficial cooperation.”Trump has continued to call the disease “the Chinese virus,” despite protestations from Beijing. Chinese diplomats have in turn pushed the idea that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, originated in the US.Xi also said he hoped the US would take “effective measures” to safeguard the lives of Chinese citizens in the US, describing the pandemic as the “common enemy of mankind.” He said: “Only by united can the international community defeat it.”After the phone call, Trump said he had a “very good conversation” with Xi. He wrote on Twitter that China had “developed a strong understanding of the virus” and was working with the US.Starting on Friday, China will temporarily bar the entry of almost all foreigners and drastically reduce flights to the country. The ban comes as the country reported its first locally infected coronavirus infection in three days and reported 54 imported cases. The move was greeted with broad support inside China.The measure applies to those with valid visas or residence permits and amounts to China shutting its borders, inviting criticism given that Beijing previously condemned other countries for similar moves. At the time, World Health Organization also advised countries not to shut their borders to Chinese travellers.In Beijing, all overseas arrivals must undergo quarantine at government-designated centres. Shanghai and other cities and provinces have implemented similarly strict rules.As China prepares to return to work and officials lift lockdowns in Hubei province, the step was greeted with support online. “I support” several wrote in comments under news of the temporary“This could not have been easy decision. I support it,” one wrote. “Foreigners should not be allowed in. Our frontline people fought so hard and foreigners are harder to regulate.”“Finally,” several others commented. “We’ve waited very long for this,” another said. Others were angry that overseas Chinese would still be allowed to return home. “Those Chinese living overseas should just not come back,” one said.The interim ban on foreigners could contribute further to diplomatic tensions as Beijing and Washington trade barbs over who is to blame for the outbreak that first emerged in central China in December before spreading to much of the rest of the world. US president Donald Trump has repeatedly called coronavirus “the Chinese virus”, prompting condemnation from Beijing.The US has now overtaken China in terms of infections, with more than 85,500 cases, compared to 81,340 in mainland China. The death toll in China was 3,292, according to health officials on Friday.Donald Trump’s instinctive response was to question other countries’ statistics. “It’s a tribute to the amount of testing that we’re doing,” Trump told reporters. “We’re doing tremendous testing, and I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that’s a little hard.”In other developments in the coronavirus pandemic:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance 2","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths.

Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings.

Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 8,200 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 120,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves.

We spoke to some of them about starting their careers during a pandemic.Michelle Magadada, 22, is a third year nursing student at the University of Huddersfield.My placement has been moved forward from to June to April because of coronavirus. I’m very nervous, but excited. It’ll be a learning experience for everyone, not just student nurses. None of us has dealt with a pandemic.Do I feel prepared? No, in that I don’t really know what to expect. Yes, in that I’ve dealt with situations in hospitals where we’ve had to be on high alert for deteriorating patients. We’re putting our health at risk, but this is what we do every day as nurses we come into contact with so many infections. I feel like we can tackle this by following the routines we’ve been taught.I live with another student nurse who’s more ready than I am, to be honest. He’s excited for a longer placement, and this time we’re actually being paid. My year missed out on bursaries, so it’s been difficult financially. For two years I had a part-time job as a healthcare assistant with an agency, picking up shifts when I didn’t have so many uni assignments. It was nearly impossible to manage. If it weren’t for my parents, I would have struggled. It’s nice to be part of something so huge. I understand that there are many students who are scared to take on this responsibility, but I feel like it’s a good thing that they’ve called on us. You have to be positive, or you’ll lose your head.Rebecca Lennox, 29, is a first year nursing student at John Moores University.I’m starting my work placement at a post-surgery ward soon. I’m worried because I’ve got two young children and a husband with bad asthma. Although I won’t be working directly with patients who are positive with the virus, I’ll be travelling and working in that hospital. The patients are already at risk so I think, what if I touch something in a lift or on the bus on to work and pass it to one of the patients? We have to do 2,300 theory hours and 2,300 clinical hours before we can register to become a nurse. The university says we have the choice not to go on placement now, but where am I going to make those hours up? I’m classed as a mature student, so it can feel like I’m on borrowed time. My dad has dementia and I worry about whether he’ll get to see me graduate. I’m a course representative at my university, so I hear a lot of concerns from other students. We feel like we’re in limbo. The university is trying to give assurances as to what’s going on with our hours and so on, but they just don’t know everything.I feel ready for the work. As student nurses, we go with the flow anyway because the health service is already so understaffed. Although we’re not meant to be counted in the numbers, we pretty much are all the time.Joseph Brooks, 27, is a third year nursing student at the University of Northampton.I’ll be going on placement in the next couple of weeks. The situation is obviously not great, but with the new rules allowing us to graduate early we’re clamouring to get out there and work. I’m most worried about passing the virus on to the patients. Since we’re students, we need to be supervised – but I have no idea how it’s going to work if supervisors end up contracting the virus and have to self-isolate. I imagine we’ll hear something closer to the time we’re getting updates every couple of days.I’ve heard that we will be paid while on placement during coronavirus. There’s also going to be a new grant for student nurses, but that doesn’t arrive until September. But while the grant is coming in now is welcome, it’s lower than it was, and tuition fees are still over £9,000 a year. Luckily for me, my employer (St Andrew’s Healthcare) is giving me a stipend of about £16,000 to go to university.It’s not as if the government wasn’t warned back in 2017 that they’d see a massive drop in nurses when they scrapped the bursary for student nurses – and that’s what happened. The thing with nurses is that they’re incredible people, but it seems to me that the government takes advantage of their good nature. In order to be come a nurse, you have to saddle yourself with debt. I don’t blame people who are put off by that – especially if they’re from low income backgrounds. More needs to be done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/069ce448baaab601d1ef4266683da1ab5afff995/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4989e15568a8fd40586b89a5c63e4b6","title":"inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine covid 19","story":"Around the world, more than 40 teams are working on a vaccine for Covid-19. We followed one doctor in the most urgent quest of his life. By  Samanth SubramanianOf the dozens of places where a coronavirus vaccine might be born, one is DIOSynVax, a small company started by a Canadian pathologist named Jonathan Heeney. In ordinary times, I’d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I’d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I’d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated containment level 3, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney’s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be “of the type used in the nuclear industry” a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.But Heeney couldn’t take the risk. Understandably, he didn’t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. “It’s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don’t know who they’re passing on the bus or the train,” he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. “I don’t have time to get sick,” Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University’s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He’s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.Since 2016, Heeney has been honing a set of methods – a platform, in vaccine parlance – that can be used to fashion vaccines that destroy whole families of viruses. Last year, he won a Gates Foundation grant of $2m (£1.6m) to fund research into a universal flu vaccine – one that will prevail against every kind of flu virus. “It’s the mother of all challenges, the holy grail,” Heeney said. In January, he kept an eye on a new disease that was flying across eastern China. After two weeks, when Chinese scientists published the coronavirus’s genetic sequence, Heeney told me his team decided: “Let’s do with this what we’re doing with the flu.”Defeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine – the quintessential silver bullet – has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don’t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ’s genetic code – its DNA or RNA – which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.Until this century, crafting a vaccine for even a long-familiar pathogen such as the polio virus, ushering it through trials and bringing it to market could take as long as 10 or 20 years. The first of these three stages is now staggeringly quick a scientist at one company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, told New Scientist magazine that her team had a preliminary model for a Covid-19 vaccine after just three hours of work.The thrust of this revolution – the capacity to create an infinitesimal part of an already minute virus, without handling a virus specimen at all – can seem godlike. But the next two stages – testing vaccines in humans and then manufacturing them for wide use – remain mortally slow. This is especially so because these newest types of vaccines – DNA or RNA vaccines – have never yet been licensed for use on humans. Outside a lab, they are completely unproven. With Covid-19, both contagion and vaccine are so new that there’s no telling what human trials will reveal, or how long they will take. Every scientist, policymaker and researcher I spoke to said that we’ll be lucky to have a vaccine for use within 12-18 months.If a DNA or RNA vaccine against Covid-19 is ever approved, it will be a watershed moment – not just because it will bear out the promise of this technology, but also because the technology will fortify us against future pandemics. Over the past few years, epidemiologists, risk analysts and policymakers have made concerted efforts to sharpen research and rethink the industrial model of vaccine production, all in preparation for the hypothetical disaster they call Disease X: any unknown disease that springs suddenly into our species and races ruinously through it. Covid-19 is the first Disease X to arise since the term was invented, but it won’t be the last. The climate is warming, we’re hacking down forests, our population is expanding and our skills at waging biological warfare are improving. The odds that we’ll keep encountering more and more Disease Xs are increasing. We will need all the vaccines we can make.Heeney was spending part of his winter break with friends in Canada when he first read about an outbreak in China. “I’m a scientist,” he said. “I can’t help but follow this kind of news, even on holiday.” Back then, it seemed like a version of flu or pneumonia that might stay in Wuhan. A few days into the new year, though, the disease’s eagerness to travel became evident, and by the time Heeney rejoined his team in Cambridge, the nature of the pathogen had become clear, too. “We thought: ‘OK, this is a coronavirus. It’s going to be a tough one.’”The first time Heeney encountered coronaviruses was in 1988, as an HIV researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Heeney had initially trained as a vet, so his boss asked him to investigate a flurry of coronavirus cases in an unusual group of patients: a pack of cheetahs. “Some collector out in Oregon was trying to preserve the species by breeding them in a captive colony,” Heeney said. The cheetahs lost weight, their gums swelled and their livers and kidneys struggled to function. They moped about their park, depressed and ill. Later, Heeney found that the feline coronavirus had been passed to the cheetahs by a domestic cat. For the next couple of decades, Heeney remained an HIV scientist. He didn’t work much with animal viruses again until 2007, when he came to Cambridge to study diseases that spilled from animals to humans, and to develop vaccines for them.In its essence, even the most advanced vaccine functions on the same premise as the earliest mode of immunisation: cotton pads soaked in smallpox pus that were stuffed into the nostrils of healthy children in 16th-century China. The principle of vaccination is still to bluff the body: to slip in weakened germs, or even parts of germs, that do no harm but induce the release of antibodies that grant long-lasting immunity. The inducements have grown more sophisticated, but they continue to rely on the body’s biological defences. Humankind has developed no system of immune response more effective than the one that’s been inside us for hundreds of thousands of years.The latest class of vaccines – the type that Heeney works on – hold genetic material such as DNA or RNA these are the kind that have never yet been licensed for use. They can be developed quickly, and they jog our immunity in distinctly different ways from everything that came before. The oldest method of vaccination involves dosing a person with inactive or enfeebled forms of the pathogen. For most of the past century, sourcing these was a laborious affair. For decades, scientists depleted the strength of viruses by growing them in human cell strains kept in labs at low temperatures once the virus was sufficiently weak, it was safe to be sent into the human body in a vaccine. One line of lung cells, sourced from an aborted foetus in Sweden and multiplied again and again in lab cultures in the US, helped inoculate 300 million people against rubella, rabies, mumps and several other diseases.In the 1980s, researchers learned to mass-produce sub-units of a virus, each fragment assembled out of proteins and sugars. This might be a toxin or a part of the viral shell – just a signature whiff of the pathogen that can trigger immune reactions when introduced into the body. These molecular fragments are called antigens, because they generate antibodies that target them. Despite this technological advance, all these antigens still had to be cultivated in labs or factories.It wasn’t until this century that the real leap occurred, propelling scientists towards DNA and RNA vaccines of the kind that Heeney and others develop. Once computers became powerful enough to sequence the genetic code of a pathogen quickly and cheaply, scientists were able to easily create snippets of its genes, which could then be sent into the human body. These snippets, using our own cells as miniature factories, can manufacture their antigens within us. As soon as a germ’s gene sequence is known, scientists can begin concocting a vaccine for it.That’s what happened with Covid-19. On the last day of 2019, Wuhan’s health authorities reported the strange pneumonia variant to the World Health Organization. By mid-January, Chinese scientists had posted online the full, machine-readable genome of the Covid-19 virus: all 29,903 nucleic bases that comprise its sequence of RNA – ribonucleic acid, its genetic material.For scientists around the world, this was the starter pistol being fired. By studying the published genome, they could single out sets of genes that make specific proteins in the Covid-19 virus: the S-protein making up the spikes on the virus’s outer envelope, for instance, or the phosphorus-laden protein in the walls of an inner capsule, packaging the RNA within.Shortly after the coronavirus’s sequence was published, Heeney’s team set to work. The central question in their research is this: what antigens – what portions of the virus – can be found that are similar across a range of coronaviruses? If scientists discover these and, by deploying them in vaccines, drill our immune systems to recognise them, we will have given ourselves a way to fend off several kinds of coronavirus diseases, including Covid-19. The spike proteins jutting out of all these viruses, giving the appearance of a fringed crown, are a prime example of such antigens. Every coronavirus uses its spikes to invade human cells. Once our immune systems engineer antibodies in reaction to a vaccine of spike-protein antigens, they will have not just a method to identify coronaviruses, but also a prospective point of attack to cripple them.The first thing Heeney’s team did was compare the genetic sequences of the Covid-19 virus and other coronavirus strains, to figure out what structural commonalities they might use as antigens. This approach put me in mind of a captain of some medieval army, who had obtained the plans of the castles he planned to attack and was now studying them to see if they all contained the same weak drawbridges, so that he could order up a single siege engine to knock them all down.When, after a few days, they had selected their antigens – the spike protein, but also some others – the biologists in Heeney’s lab looked for their “blueprints”: the genes that direct the virus to construct each of these antigens. These lie in the gene sequences of the coronaviruses: one section of genetic code that holds the information to make a spike protein, another section for a different antigen, and so on. In late January, the lab sent these sections of code electronically to a German company, which built them out into synthetic genes – made artificially, but otherwise consisting of the same sugars and other material as our own DNA.These minuscule lengths of DNA were sent back to Cambridge suspended in vials of colourless, viscous fluid. In any eventual human trials, this DNA will be injected into the body to do what it’s meant to do: construct antigens to prod the immune system into action. This is all meticulous, elaborate work, but the power of modern computing can hurry it along at astonishing speed. By the first week of February, Heeney said, his scientists were carrying out trials in mice.In all of this, no one in Heeney’s team handled the coronavirus itself in fact, until the synthetic DNA arrived from Germany, most of their work was on computers. This would have been unimaginable for earlier generations of vaccine scientists, who took in full-strength pathogens and then, with immense care, whittled down their potency. Heeney longed to know, first-hand, how the virus behaves in cells and what kinds of antibodies respond to it. For weeks, he said, “no one outside China had isolated the virus”. Then, towards the end of January, scientists at the University of Melbourne announced that they’d grown cultures of the virus.Braving the uncertainties of travel, Heeney flew via Thailand to Australia, arriving in time for the first inoculation of a mouse with the cultured virus on 19 February. “I wanted to establish some collaborations with these teams. They’ll be important for us down the line,” Heeney told me. In a bygone time, he might have brought back a vial of virus with him. “When I was a youngster, people would just put samples in their briefcases, or in the breast pockets of their coats. But the biosecurity protocols are intense now, so you can’t do that any more.”Unlike Heeney’s project, which takes on a whole family of viruses, most vaccine projects are targeting just the virus causing Covid-19, but they follow the same basic, still-experimental approach: synthesise DNA or RNA, tuck that genetic material into a vaccine and have it build antigens once it’s shot into the body. (I found only a couple of projects that are working the older way, using a weakened form of the whole virus in a vaccine.) Heeney is fully aware that these DNA and RNA vaccines may all still collapse in trials. “There are graveyards full of failed viral vaccine candidates,” he said. But if even one succeeds, “then we’ll be entering a brave new world of vaccines”.To an outsider, the design of a DNA or RNA vaccine in a lab seems like cool, ordered science, conducted by computers, technicians in sterile oversuits, and machines that hum quietly. The next stage – when the vaccine has to negotiate clinical trials – is rife with all the messy uncertainties of human biology. In other words, while genetic technology has dramatically shrunk the first leg of the process from years to weeks, the second leg remains as long as ever, so that vaccine development now resembles a pair of misshapen trousers.In the literature, past mishaps flash like red warning signals. In 1942, a yellow fever vaccine contaminated with a hepatitis B virus was given to more than 300,000 American troops nearly 150 of them died. The field’s classic reference text, Plotkin’s Vaccines, by the physician Stanley Plotkin, refers sombrely to “the Cutter incident” – a 1955 episode in which a manufacturer named Cutter Laboratories failed to properly deactivate the virus in its polio shot. The faulty vaccine caused roughly 40,000 cases of polio, paralysed 260 people and killed 10.The US’s strict rules to regulate vaccines emerged, in part, because of Cutter Laboratories. The company survived, but paid out millions in civil damages. The Cutter incident set a precedent for more lawsuits during the next three decades, in which parents argued that their children had been disabled by malfunctioning vaccines. Some pharma firms, worried about multimillion-dollar claims settlements, abandoned vaccines altogether others hiked their prices to cover any future legal costs. To keep vaccines cheap and vaccinations regular, the US government had to set up a compensation fund that eased most of the liability on vaccine companies.In the midst of a pandemic, so many forces tug at the vaccine development process – politics, industry, science, money, fear, hope – that there’s a perpetual hazard of clinical trials being hurried or of a poorly planned vaccination scheme being rushed out. One historical analogue is found in 1976 – like 2020, an election year. That February, a bout of swine flu broke out in an army post in New Jersey, and one soldier died. In comparison to Covid-19, the outbreak now seems minor, but it jolted President Ford’s government, which was already suffering from the second-hand shame of Nixon’s resignation just two years earlier. The administration fretted that, in the autumn, at the height of flu season, the virus would exact a huge loss of life one government estimate figured that 1 million Americans would die.So Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country, and had the Centers for Disease Control draft a $136m plan to do it. He ignored Albert Sabin, one of the heroes of the polio vaccine, who advised against immunisation, believing that no epidemic was imminent. Ford also ignored the warnings coming out of clinical trials, in which one of the four manufacturers was found to have formulated some unknown number of its 2.6m doses with a different flu virus altogether. Congress exempted all these companies from liabilities if their vaccine harmed anyone. Beginning in October, 40 million Americans were vaccinated, but by mid-December, it emerged that the shot came with a slightly increased risk of contracting Guillain–Barré syndrome, an immobilising neurological condition.The vaccine campaign was scrapped soon after by that time, close to 450 people had been afflicted with Guillain–Barré. It was impossible to say how many of these cases were seeded by the vaccine. And if the vaccine really did prevent a swine flu epidemic, there was no way to know the counterfactual – no vaccination, a ravaging pandemic – was hidden from view. This vaccine’s legacy, in public memory, was the paralysis of those hundreds of people.Already, the temptation to accelerate the trials of Covid-19 vaccines is becoming apparent. Earlier this month, Donald Trump suggested using “a solid flu vaccine … on corona”. Not possible, scientists informed him. When he declared that a vaccine would be available within a few months, he had to be told that, in that time, vaccines would only be ready for testing. Ordinarily, human trials come after many phases of animal testing, but at least two companies – one of them Moderna – have decided to do both in parallel. The scientists I spoke to, though, kept telling me that testing couldn’t be rushed. “There will be many trials, and we need to be ready for some failures,” Heeney said. He leaned in towards his webcam as if to push his point physically through the internet to me. “We have to avoid overpromising, because if there’s an accident with one of those first vaccines – if someone gets ill and it gets into the Daily Mail, ‘New vaccine threatens survival’ or some ridiculous headline – then people won’t want to take even the later vaccines that do work. It’s a razor’s edge we’re walking here.”Among the peculiarities of this pandemic, moreover, is the fact that we, the general populace, might determine how well human trials go. If huge swathes of society become infected before the vaccine is ready to test on humans, the trials will be difficult to conduct, said Sarah Gilbert, an immunologist at the University of Oxford’s Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. Gilbert’s team also has a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, based on an earlier vaccine it had devised for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, another coronavirus disease. In mid-March, Gilbert had to put an auto-response on her email. When her team was ready to recruit subjects for vaccine trials, it would be advertised on the website, she wrote. “Please do not contact me about volunteering.”Gilbert’s worry is that, at the peak of infection, the virus will be bouncing so frantically around the population that “you can’t screen your volunteers. By the time you get their results back, they may have been exposed.” Organising trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have cultivated a natural immunity by then. Transmission will have dropped as well, Gilbert said – it’s hard to know how well a vaccine trial is going if the subjects aren’t being exposed to the virus at all. “This is herd immunity – good for the population, but it makes testing a vaccine more difficult,” she explained.The best possible scenario involves delaying the pandemic’s peak – pushing it through the summer towards August, to buy scientists a few extra months to run their trials. “So we’d really be pleased,” Gilbert said sternly, “if everyone will just do what they’re being told and stay at home.”At some point in March, Heeney’s sense of time started to grow muddled. Things happened so fast, and his weeks were so full, that dates lost their meaning once, while speaking to me, he had to thumb back through his email to recollect even roughly when a particular step in his research had happened. “The coronavirus dominates our days,” he said. He wakes before dawn to pore through feeds of scientific data and journal articles. “There are conference calls, there’s all this paperwork to fill out so we can deal safely with pathogens, there’s the need to scale up the lab to work on the vaccine. There’s just no routine anymore. It feels like the wild west right now.”Like every other scientist, Heeney spends part of his days worrying about funding. All these vaccine projects hurtling towards trials may yet be drawn to a screeching halt by a lack of money. Trials are expensive so is the outlay on manufacturing and marketing vaccines. “If you’re going to make enough doses for the whole world, you’re going to need billions and billions of dollars,” Heeney said. Earlier this week, the Wellcome Trust put an exact number on it: a further $3bn, across the industry, to fund and produce enough vaccines to beat the pandemic.Most of this money will go towards trials and production, the costs of which are now frequently borne by drug companies. After the 80s, when a series of mergers left the pharma industry in the hands of a few behemoth companies, vaccines fell thoroughly under the sway of market forces, subject to the kind of logic that prompted Goldman Sachs, in a 2018 report, to wonder: “Is curing patients a sustainable business model?” (It isn’t, the analysts concluded.)Diseases that are borne out of poverty, and that require cheap vaccines, such as cholera, are largely ignored, says Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So are diseases that are uncommon, or diseases that have come and gone. Taxpayers fund most vaccine research, but the pharma titans that can make them at scale are reluctant to commit to a vaccine if the likelihood of profit is meagre. “We have a broken ecosystem for making vaccines,” Hotez told me.If the business wasn’t set up this way, Hotez thinks, he’d have a Covid-19 vaccine to offer, based on an earlier project that wilted from lack of funding. The story of Hotez’s vaccine is a parable for this field, and it foretells one highly possible future for all the exciting vaccine work currently underway against Covid-19.When Sars broke out in 2002, scientists and companies rolled up their sleeves to deliver a vaccine. But after 2004, no Sars cases were reported, so research flagged one vaccine, from Sanofi, never made it past clinical trials. Ideally, Hotez says, vaccines would still have been run through the first few steps of trials and kept in reserve for future emergencies. Between 2011 and 2016, Hotez and his team designed a potential vaccine for Sars, and had the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research make 20,000 doses, to test on humans. But none of Hotez’s usual funders gave him a grant for these trials. “Sars dropped off their list of priorities,” Maria Elena Bottazzi, one of Hotez’s collaborators at Baylor, told me. “We had other situations, like Ebola or Zika.” The industry’s attention is easily erted, Hotez said. “It’s like little kids playing a football game. The ball goes in one direction and all the kids run after it. Then it goes in another direction and all the kids run that way.”So much about Covid-19 is still unclear that companies can’t yet gauge the profit margins on a vaccine. Will the disease fade before a vaccine is approved? Will DNA or RNA vaccines even work? Will everyone be inoculated – a bumper payday from billions of doses – or will vaccines go to just a few at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers or anyone over 40? “At some point, there will be a gono-go decision to make for companies,” said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy scholar at Yale. “And then they’ll have to figure out if it’s worth the risk.” One way to make it worthwhile is to engage in price gouging, which drug companies have always been happy to do. Earlier this month, the US passed a coronavirus spending bill that deliberately left out controls on vaccine prices.At the same time, pharma companies are indispensable, said Charlie Weller, who heads the vaccines programme at the Wellcome Trust. (When Weller spoke to me one evening on the phone, she had to break off for a minute to comfort her little daughter, who’d burst into tears after learning that, as the child of a key worker, she’d have to keep going to school even while her friends stayed home.) Pharma firms pay for most clinical trials, invest in experts and equipment, and bring drugs to market. They assume the right to set prices and decide what vaccines to sell because they claim to bear the most financial risk. “If we have to be ready for more Disease Xs, we need to rethink this whole underlying structure,” Weller told me. “We have to do it so that the risk is shared.”Two years ago, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) was founded to do just this: to allay some of the financial risk of research, and to keep this research going even in the troughs between epidemics. Cepi’s funding – about $740m – comes from a combination of philanthropists and governments. Melanie Saville, its director of vaccine development, told me that they were funding eight ongoing Covid-19 vaccine projects. But Cepi’s own money for Covid-19 was going to run out by the end of March. Without more donations, none of its funded vaccines would progress beyond the first phase of clinical trials.One of Cepi’s ambitions is to create its own “investigational stockpile” of vaccines – vaccines that have passed the first two out of three stages of clinical trials, and that then bide their time in cold storage. Everyone hopes they will never be required, but if necessary, they can be brought forth, hustled through the final clinical trial stage – which must be conducted in a real outbreak – and launched into production. Saville said Cepi has no storage or clinical facilities of its own, and that the stockpiles would reside inidually with manufacturers. This disappointed me for a second, I’d dreamed of a vaccine storehouse nestled somewhere in the Arctic – a Svalbard against sickness, a vault so titanic that it dwarfed the germs it intended to fight by zillions of orders of magnitude.A week after I met Heeney on Zoom, I called him again. He gave me a phone number in his Cambridge college he had decided to self-quarantine himself in a room after all. “It’s not like I’ve been at risk, but if one of us goes down, we all go down like dominoes,” he said. He was full of praise for his team – “all these bright, talented iniduals who are still living at home but are otherwise trying to live isolated lives, like monks in a monastery”. When Heeney moved into his room, he wiped down all the surfaces. One day, he went to get a cup of coffee, and when he came back to his room, he saw that two men had come in to change the batteries in the fire alarm. “It was crazy. I thought: ‘Here I am trying to keep the risk factor low. Does this have to happen now?’”His lab is still running trials in mice. It’s a long process, he said. “You take tissue cultures from the mice and you study them. We’re getting all this data, so that we can see what works and what doesn’t.” It’s too early to tell which of the vaccine projects out there will succeed, he said. “You know, I think it’s pretty amazing that humans have got vaccines in trials already,” Heeney said. “The trials will tell us what we need to know. My worry is that the devil is in the details with this coronavirus. But I hope I’m wrong. I really hope I’m wrong.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9de242ba20d36bd18694b4a7b8e1aaa9367ef4e7/0_6_6046_3629/master/6046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2355e3ec35f80480a36072a544ef8b80","title":"mothers say they being kept at work uk as fathers stay home","story":"Charities hit out at firms’ unequal coronavirus stance as pregnant women also lose outMothers with school-age children are being told they cannot work from home during the coronavirus pandemic, while fathers at the same companies are encouraged to do so, according to organisations providing legal advice and support for parents.Legal advice lines have also been inundated with calls from pregnant women who have been made redundant while male workers have been kept on, and others who have been told they must go to work or face the sack despite being categorised as a vulnerable group in government guidance.“We are seeing parents, the overwhelming majority of them mothers, getting in touch to say their employers are not letting them work from home because schools have closed, and in some instances their male colleagues have been allowed to do so,” said Julia Waltham, the joint head of policy and influencing at the charity Working Families. “Too often it is women who are expected to take up the slack at home and many mothers are feeling very vulnerable about work at the moment.”Anna (not her real name) said her pay had been cut and hours reduced since the crisis struck. “I’m constantly being advised to reduce my hours as I can’t possibly manage two kids and my job at home,” she said. “It’s only the women that get asked on calls how they are managing – the men with childcare are fine to work as normal.”People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.The charity, which has detailed advice for parents, praised action already taken to protect workers but called for clear messaging that employers should be as flexible as possible and staff should not be automatically furloughed. “If employers make wholesale decisions to ‘furlough’ one working parent in each working family, all the evidence suggests that it is overwhelmingly working mothers who will be put in this position,” the letter says.Joeli Brearley, the founder of the Pregnant Then Screwed campaign, said hundreds of pregnant women and mothers had called for advice and support since UK schools closed on 20 March, leaving millions of families juggling childcare and work commitments.“Yet again it is women scooping up the unpaid labour to keep things ticking over during a crisis,” she said. “We are seeing companies telling staff to work from home but denying women with kids that possibility, and we’re seeing pregnant women laid off without any sort of process while others are told they have to come into work.”Sarah (not her real name), who is pregnant and works in a call centre that arranges hire cars, was told she had to continue working as the firm’s staff have been classified as key workers and cannot work from home. She was advised that if she followed government guidelines and self-isolated for 12 weeks the company could not guarantee her pay.Pregnant women taking sick pay in order to self-isolate could also find they are not eligible for statutory maternity pay (SMP), which is calculated on the amount they get paid in the two months before the end of the 15th week before the baby is due. Claire, who works in customer service for a car insurance company, said she was not allowed to work from home even though she was 22 weeks pregnant, in the SMP qualifying period, and most of her colleagues were working remotely. “My family is putting pressure on me to stay home and not put myself or the baby at risk. I’m so stressed I don’t know what to do,” she said.“Many of the women we have spoken to, particularly single parents, are telling us they suddenly have no income, no way of paying their rent or buying food for their kids,” Brearley said. “It’s a horrible situation, and it’s been really stressful being at the coalface of that without any clear advice from the government to give.”Women’s rights groups have warned that the current gender-blind response to the coronavirus crisis risks setting gender equality back years, and called for the needs of women to be factored into policymaking. This week more than 50 organisations signed a statement calling on the government to consider the specific challenges faced by women, while women’s organisations are gathering data on how the crisis is affecting women specifically.Sam Smethers, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said women were more likely to be on the frontline delivering essential services, in low-paid and insecure work and caring for children and older relatives, as well as significantly more likely to be put at risk of self-isolating with an abusive partner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74879789f3f89076f2a2d94012597817a6f070d5/0_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c625535a65ee0307e96bb56b1759420f","title":"practical tips physical distancing shopping lockdown coronavirus supplies","story":"Buying essential supplies can be tricky during the coronavirus lockdown. Here’s how to navigate the new rulesWith lockdown conditions imposed in many countries to try to prevent the spread of coronavirus, everyday activities such as shopping are going to be different from usual for some time.Here are some tips on how to practise physical distancing while purchasing essential food and medical supplies.Keep clear of people on the way to and from the shops, and when inside them as well, if possible. Be patient and take your turn to access goods in fridges and freezers. Some supermarkets are helping to do this by limiting the number of people who can be inside a shop at any given time. When purchasing your shopping, try to keep your distance from shop workers as well. With self-service checkouts and pin pads, you may have no choice but to come into contact with surfaces that have been handled by many people. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth until you have washed your hands. Some stores are providing hand sanitiser, and cleaning shopping trolleys and baskets between customers.Clearly there will be exceptions: for example, single parents with small children who cannot be left at home, but where possible you should try to shop alone. That will reduce the number of people inside stores, making physical distancing easier to achieve. It also reduces the number of people in your household exposed to the outdoors. Remember: studies show that, on average, people can have coronavirus for five days before they develop any symptoms, and all that time they can be unwittingly spreading it.It is natural that people worried about potentially being stuck indoors self-isolating for 14 days want to stock up on supplies. However, panic-buying means there can be shortages of food and medical products for people who rely on them. And there are reports of increased food waste as people have stockpiled perishable goods that they could not possibly have consumed in time. If everybody buys only what they need, there will be enough for all.Many shops including supermarkets are setting aside certain hours of the week specifically for shopping to be carried out by key workers, the elderly, and those with underlying health conditions that mean they are trying to shield themselves from exposure to the virus. Clearly, it is difficult to enforce this, but be considerate when you choose to visit the shops to avoid coming into contact with these groups.The fewer people on the streets and in shops, the less chance there is for people to pass on coronavirus. If you can get delivery services, this will reduce the amount of times you have to leave the house. This will help slow, and ease, the peak of infections in the population that politicians and scientists worry will overwhelm health services."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfab7e160a506bdf7cdb9880908ace6382ee20c0/0_0_3318_1990/master/3318.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84bea2c6a02fad000ef7d74375e53da4","title":"stranded at sea cruise ships around the world are adrift as ports turn them away","story":"A  analysis finds that at least 10 ships – carrying nearly 10,000 passengers – remain at sea after their destinations refuse themPorts around the globe are turning cruise ships away en masse amid the coronavirus pandemic, leaving thousands of passengers stranded even as some make desperate pleas for help while sickness spreads aboard.Four passengers have died aboard one such vessel, the Holland America cruise ship Zaandam, which has been stranded for days after Chile refused to allow the ship to dock in its original destination of San Antonio on 21 March.The Zaandam is one of at least 10 ships around the world – carrying nearly 10,000 passengers – still stuck at sea after having been turned away from their destination ports in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a  analysis. Some of the ships are facing increasingly desperate medical situations.Holland America announced Friday that four elderly passengers had died and two others had tested positive for coronavirus, with 138 additional cases of respiratory illness on board further tests are still being conducted among its 1,243 guests and 586 crew. The Zaandam is carrying hundreds of American, Canadian, Australian and British passengers, and is currently off the coast of Ecuador and seeking permission to dock in Florida.The ship is steaming up the coast of South America, hoping to make it through the Panama Canal and on to the US. But the Florida port, where many of the passengers had planned to disembark on the final leg of the cruise, has refused to confirm that the ship can dock.While the Zaandam and at least two other ships still carrying passengers at sea have reported outbreaks of coronavirus-like respiratory illness onboard, other ships are being turned away from docking and unloading their passengers even with no signs of illness at all.Dramatic scenes of coronavirus-stricken cruises, such as the Grand Princess in California and the Diamond Princess in Japan, have become synonymous with the pandemic. The plight of those still adrift highlights how cruise ships have become a kind of pariah of the seas, with cities wary of becoming the next home for a potentially infected vessel.On the Zaandam, which was headed northeast along the coast of Ecuador on Thursday, anxiety was growing.Passengers who spoke with the  describe being locked down in the cabins, with three daily meals left on the floor outside their doors. Meanwhile the number of people reporting influenza-like symptoms has almost tripled this week: 56 passengers and 89 crew members, passengers say the ship’s captain has told them. Four elderly passengers reportedly required oxygen.But on Tuesday a port commission in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, delayed approving the Zaandam’s request, with some commissioners arguing the ship should be turned away because it didn’t originate in Florida, and others calling the situation a humanitarian crisis and saying the passengers should be allowed to disembark, according to the Miami Herald.Amid the confusion, passengers began an online lobbying campaign to convince Florida officials to allow the boat to dock. “I am a US citizen and longtime Florida resident who is stranded at sea off the coast of South America,” wrote passenger Laura Gabaroni Huergo on Facebook on Wednesday. “Some (Florida) county officials are trying to turn us away and abandon us at sea to fend for ourselves. We need help getting a plan together to dock and return to our lives.”Holland America said this week it had dispatched support in the form of another cruise ship, the Rotterdam, carrying 611 extra staff, supplies and coronavirus test kits to meet up with the stricken ship.The company announced Friday that it plans to offload healthy passengers to the Rotterdam, while keeping ill passengers and those who have been exposed to them aboard the Zaandam.“Priority for the first guests to transfer will be given to those on Zaandam with inside staterooms and who are over 70,” said the statement from Holland America. “Once aboard Rotterdam, all guests will continue to remain in their staterooms until disembarkation. Any guests who are currently ill, or in isolation as a close contact, and all crew will remain on Zaandam.”The company’s statement said there are now four doctors and four nurses aboard the Zaandam and two doctors and four nurses on the Rotterdam.As the Rotterdam pulled alongside the Zaandam in darkness Thursday night, passengers exchanged photos and cheered each other on a Facebook group created for the ship.“I would have rather had a helicopter, but beggars can’t be choosers,” said one.As of Thursday, the  had identified five ships in the Americas that were unable to unload nearly 6,000 passengers. At least three other ships were having trouble off the coast of Australia, including one which sought urgent medical attention for an outbreak of respiratory illness. Two more ships were trying to get passengers to ports in Italy.Lori Bessler, a southern California resident whose parents are stuck onboard the Coral Princess, another boat stranded off the coast of Brazil with no reported illness onboard, says she is nonetheless concerned for her family’s health and wellbeing. “My mom and stepdad are diabetics and … we’re very concerned about them having enough medication to sustain them,” she told the .The Coral Princess was due to dock in Buenos Aires on 18 March but is now headed for Florida. So far the cruise ship has only been allowed to disembark passengers from South America more than a thousand US, Canadian and British citizens, including Bessler’s parents, remain on the ship.Bessler said she has struggled to get information from either the cruise company or from US government officials. She worries that Florida may become overrun by Covid-19 cases by the time the ship arrives there in two weeks.“It’s a scary situation,” said Bessler, who has been texting with her mom many times a day. “I think they need to be rescued and brought to their homes.”The fast-moving nature of the virus has added to the confusion – when many passengers left for vacations in early March there were no cases of Covid-19 in South America, so they thought it would be safe to travel.But Ross Klein, a professor at St John’s College in Newfoundland who has written four books on the cruise industry, said companies should have acted weeks earlier to cancel trips and refund customers. He noted that cases of cruise ships being turned away from ports as a result of coronavirus fears began as early as January and escalated in February, with passengers being quarantined on the Emerald Princess in Japan on 3 February.“There is a level of greed on the part of these companies,” he said. “They want to make every penny – and they make money when people are on the ships.”Cruise ships are drawing increasing government scrutiny for not doing enough to protect their passengers during this pandemic. In Florida, the attorney general’s office is investigating potentially misleading sales practices, after the Miami New Times obtained leaked emails showing representatives for Norwegian Cruise Lines may have downplayed the coronavirus in sales pitches to passengers, even as the pandemic was disrupting trips. “The Coronavirus can only survive in cold temperatures, so the Caribbean is a fantastic choice for your next cruise,” said one sales script obtained by the paper.Despite Donald Trump’s repeated vows to bail out the cruise ship industry, money for cruise companies was not a part of the $500bn in aid for large employers included in stimulus bill passed by Congress on Wednesday.Most of the major cruise operators register their companies in countries such as Panama and Liberia, thereby avoiding most US taxes and labor laws. Thus, the cruise industry’s trade group said on Thursday the companies will not have access to the US aid for large employers, according to the Washington Post.Meanwhile a report from the US Centers for Disease Control this week laid the blame on cruise ships for spreading the virus in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak, linking hundreds of cases to the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess.“Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of their closed environment, contact between travelers from many countries, and crew transfers between ships,” the CDC report concluded.Back aboard the Zaandam, passengers are passing the time however they can. Some chat with other cabins on a Facebook group, others enjoy the free liquor, snap pictures of brown boobies flying outside their windows, or partake in meditation, yoga classes and a daily quiz offered via the ship’s TV. Passengers joke the top quiz prize should be extra face masks or toilet paper, or a chance to get outside and do laps around the promenade deck.But despite moments of levity, the situation is bleak.“I’m safe and healthy right now. Staying confined in my cabin except for the strange ritual of eating meals in the crew mess while maintaining a safe distance from each other,” he wrote on Monday. “I won’t lie: things are looking grim here and I just want to go home. We all do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb6769976a80b599c5af2d47f19250ad6447b53/0_199_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a46393ac51450fd73e04825ee3456e3d","title":"uk urged to help stranded brits covid 19 pandemic pakistan nepal","story":"Hundreds of citizens are stuck in countries including Nepal and Pakistan, lacking consular support A cross-party group of more than 60 MPs has urged the government to arrange charter flights to bring home British nationals stranded abroad as further stories of people stuck in dire circumstances emerged.Hundreds of vulnerable British citizens are stranded in Pakistan with many of them running short of the vital medication they need to treat serious health conditions.Accounts also emerged from Nepal, where hundreds of British tourists are stuck, some high up in the mountains with no way of getting back to the towns and home.British nationals have complained of receiving little to no consular support and say there is a lack of clear advice from the Foreign Office. The cost of commercial flights has skyrocketed.Among the British people stranded in Lahore, Pakistan, is 60-year-old Tanweer Ahmed Khan from Manchester, alongside six members of his family.Khan’s daughter, Ikra Naser, said her party, aged four to 65, had been due to fly back to the UK on Friday after visiting a sick relative but they had been stranded.Naser said: “My father has a severe heart condition and severe arthritis. He took enough medication to last until Monday but then we don’t know what he’ll do. My mum also suffers health conditions and she must travel with my dad to look after him, given how strong his meds are.”The outward flights cost £500 each for a return but the family is facing paying up to £2,000 for a single trip back – if they can even find one to take. Khan said she had spent many hours contacting the FCO. “But they don’t seem to care. I’m scared for my parents.”Another Briton, Adnan Aftab from Birmingham, said he was with his mother who had underlying health issues.Sahiba Sajid, an NHS hospital social worker from Leeds who is stranded in Pakistan, said: “I’m frustrated that I’m not able to return. The team I work in was already under a lot of pressure before I went abroad and I can only imagine how they are managing. I just want to go back and work but I’m stuck here instead.”Afzal Khan, the MP for Manchester Gorton, said a significant number of British nationals were stuck in Pakistan.Khan said: “I have been contacted by a number of constituents who are growing increasingly anxious about being unable to return home to the UK. Many have serious underlying health conditions and are running low on essential medication which is only adding to their anxieties. We are calling on the government to do more to bring British citizens home to safety.”Julie McElhinney and Dave Wong, from London, were in the Nepalese mountains when it was announced that flights were to stop. “We struggled to find things in English to understand what was going on,” said McElhinney.They managed to get to Kathmandu but information was still scarce. “We were gleaning information from fellow travellers and locals, basically trying to work on rumours,” McElhinney said.“We and others have used family to phone the Foreign Office, the embassy and airlines but mostly just had generic information that they are working on it. There’s a lot of frustration that communications has not been good. We’ve managed to reschedule flights for 4 April but we don’t know if it will happen. The challenge for everyone is not knowing.“We feel apprehensive about what could happen in the coming weeks. There is uncertainty about food, accommodation, flights. A large number of locals have fled Kathmandu for their villages so a lot of things aren’t open. Our Nepalese hosts have been trying their best to get us food and look after us but there’s a lot of fear here about the poor medical facilities if Covid-19 was to take hold.”Wong said: “The main issue is the lack of transparency, action and progress from the British embassy when compared to our European neighbours.“Further up in the mountains there are people worse off than us and are worried about how they are going to get home. They’ve spent all their money on multiple airline tickets and are struggling to get refunds.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6371354c3458869a0c36e89ecc13d6a77b7ebcc1/0_194_818_491/master/818.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9928c3c45cdd331a2f75657779c4f12","title":"utrecht rooftops greened plants mosses vertical forest","story":"‘Vertical forest’ tower will have 10,000 plants on its facade in bid to reinvigorate bioersityEvery roof in the city district of Utrecht is to be “greened” with plants and mosses or have solar panels installed under plans driven by the success of a similar scheme for the municipality’s bus stops.The “no roofs unused” policy is part of an attempt to reinvigorate bioersity in the city and create a less stressful and happier environment, of which the construction of a so-called “vertical forest tower with 10,000 plants on its facade is set to become a leading example.That building alone, close to Utrecht railway station, will host 360 trees and 9,640 shrubs and flowers, equal to 1 hectare (2.47 acres) of woods, once it is completed in 2022.Alderman Kees Diepeveen said: “In this city district every roof will be either used for green or for solar panels. It will be that when you look at the different heights, the lower rooftops will be mainly green and the higher ones will be mainly solar panels. And now again a combination of the two because solar panels need some cooling.“The green can offer the cooling for the solar panels to function properly. It will be a regulation: all roofs are used.”Utrecht, the fastest growing city in the Netherlands, was rated in a 2019 study by Natuur \u0026amp Milieu as the most “sustainable” in the country in terms of buying green electricity, its use of environmental zones, exploitation of solar power and encouragement of cycling.The municipality completed the installation of green roofs on its 316 bus stops last year, capturing fine particles of air pollution, storing rainwater, and providing cooling during the summer months.The bus stops roofs are planted with sedum, a plant with small yellow flowers in the summer months, draws birds, bees and butterflies. The bus stops, fitted with bamboo benches, feature energy-efficient LED lighting and 96 of them have been outfitted with solar panels.The bases of the shelters are made of recycled concrete and the municipality says the maintenance will be carried out solely by electric vehicles. The city, the fourth largest in the Netherlands, plans to use “completely clean public transport” by 2028 with the electricity used to power the buses being produced by Dutch windmills.The 300ft-high Utrecht vertical forest, a landmark building in the newly greened city centre, will comprise 200 apartments. Its facade, roof and balconies will be filled with around half the trees and shrubs presently found in Central Park in New York.Its developers claim it will absorb about 5.4 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year and produce about 41 tonnes of oxygen, equivalent to that generated by a hectare of forest."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213251.1585250368!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"stop trying to be superheroes principal s message to parents","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCatriona Golden, principal at Ennis Educate Together National School, says many parents feel stressed and  overwhelmed by the schoolwork being sent home for their children.At a time when parents are fretting about trying to juggle work and their children’s home learning, one school principal’s advice has gone viral: “Stop trying to be superheroes”.Catriona Golden, principal at Ennis Educate Together National School, sent a message which struck a chord with parents feeling stressed and overwhelmed by work sent home for their children.One of her blunt, but practical, messages was that trying to give your children educational activities at home “is not homeschooling”.“This is an unprecedented emergency situation impacting the whole world. Let’s keep perspective,” she wrote in a message, reprinted in full below.\u0026nbsp“Homeschooling is a choice . . . you are your child’s school teacher in whatever form you choose . This is at best distance learning. In reality, it’s everyone trying to separate their bums from their elbows because none of us know what we’re doing and what’s right and wrong here.”She also said it was “absolutely not possible” to facilitate distance learning with a primary-aged child and work from home at the same time.“The very idea is nonsense. If you’re trying to do that, stop now. You can certainly have activities where your child learns, but your focus is your job, and survival. Again, unprecedented. Stop trying to be superheroes,” she wrote.Speaking to The  , Golden said she wrote it originally in a parenting group after seeing parents’ anxiety online.“They felt they were suddenly expected to be parent, employee and teacher all at the same time, as well as wading through their own stress and worry around this unprecedented situation.“But ultimately I wanted people to recognise that they are in charge, they are the primary educator and they needed to let go of any worry or guilt around their choices for their children in this timeHer post has now been shared by hundreds of thousands of people, by schools and by parents across the world, which has been “a surreal experience”.“I didn’t expect it to go beyond the original group. Hence the tone being very informal and casual and not what I’d have gone with had it been a letter directly to our parents or an article for the website,” she says.“It’s been shared over 100k times on Facebook between different pages which is surreal to say the least. But I’m happy it struck a chord and the feedback that it has really reassured parents is very rewarding.”Message from Catriona Golden to parents:Covid Distance Learning Q\u0026ampAUsual disclaimer, I’m a school principal but I speak only for myself. Others may have different ideasI’m seeing a lot of threads online with the same general theme, so I wanted to just given a schools perspective on it all and answer some FAQs. Also happy to answer any questions people have that I can answer.Lots of people feeling stressed, overwhelmed and under pressure by the work being sent home for kids. I hope this can help with that somewhat.Few points to note first :1) This is not homeschooling. This is an unprecedented emergency situation impacting the whole world. Let’s keep perspective. Homeschooling is a choice, where you considered, you plan for it and you are your child’s school teacher in whatever form you choose . This is at best distance learning. In reality, it’s everyone trying to separate their bums from their elbows because none of us know what we’re doing and what’s right and wrong here.2) You are, and always have been, your child’s primary educator. If you decide that your child isn’t going to engage with anything sent home and is going to spend the entire period playing in the dirt, or baking, or watching TV, that is your choice. That is your right. It is clear in the constitution. There is nothing to stress or feel guilty about.3) Schools don’t know what they’re doing either. They got no notice, no prep time and we’re told “continue to plan lessons as normal and just send them home’ as if that is in any way possible. If it were, we’d all be out of a job very quickly. I won’t rant about my thoughts on the Dept on this, but suffice it to say your school is winging it.”4) It is absolutely not possible to facilitate distance learning with a primary aged child and work from home at the same time. The very idea is nonsense. If you’re trying to do that, stop now. You can certainly have activities where your child learns, but your focus is your job, and survival. Again, unprecedented. Stop trying to be superheroes.- My school has sent home lots of physical work. Pages and pages, hours and hours. How am I supposed to get through it all?!You’re not, don’t try. Your child’s teacher spent a couple of hours in utter panic gathering things to send home so they could say they did their best and there weren’t a lot if complaints that enough didn’t go home. It’s not a competition, or a race, it’s unlikely the teacher will even manage to look at it all.- My school keeps sending home links and emails with more work. How do I make it stop. AhhhhhhSee above. These are suggestions and ideas because the school is worried it’ll be said they’re not offering enough. Use them if they suit you, don’t if they don’t. If you’re getting stressed, stop opening the emails. No one will know!- X in my child’s class has everything done and we’ve barely started. Will they fall behind?Even if everything were equal in terms of support and time and number of kids etc (which it’s not) kids learn at different rates. In the class there’s a wide range of levels in all subjects, there’s different paces and there are many kids working on differentiated level of work. It’s almost impossible for teachers do differentiate at the moment, so you have to do it. By expectation and by time.Your child will not fall behind. This is all revision and reminder work. If kids could learn new concepts without specific teaching we wouldn’t need teachers. They will cover all of this again, multiple times.- I’m not doing any work with my kids. All their doing is Lego, cooking and playing outside.All of this is learning. Very valuable learning. Give yourself and them a break.- How can I get three different lots of work done with 3 different kids of different ages?You can’t, stop trying. If they’re old enough, try to get them to do little bits independently. Otherwise try to do something they can all engage with, reading a story together, some free writing, baking etc.- So what’s the bare minimum you’d expect?For me, survival mode. I won’t pretend that may be true of all teachers, but you know what if they can’t have perspective in a time like this then I wouldn’t overly worry about their opinion anyway.My ideal for my kids in our school?- A bit of reading every day (independent or to them or via audiobook etc).- some free writing now and then. If they’ll keep a diary or something, great. If not, would they draw a comic?- Practical hands on maths. Be that via cooking, cleaning, outside or some maths games physical or digital.- Some fine motor work. Lego, cutting, playdough, tidying up small toys.- Some artmusic where possible through the week. Doesn’t need to be guided.-Stretch goal, if old enough getting them to independently work on a project is great for keeping brains ticking over. Get them researching in a book or online and putting together something to present to you or family.- If younger, lots of imaginative free play, the more independent the better.You are doing enough. You are loving your kids and supporting them through a difficult time. Look after yourself. Minimising stress is absolutely vital in a time like this for mental health. Don’t let this be something that stresses you. Only you can control that by accepting it is in your circle of control, you are the primary educator and this is all your call.Happy to answer any questions if you have any.*Apologies, this post is much longer than anticipated! *Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

The Government has been given approval to send a repatriation flight to the country to pick up more than 100 Irish citizens who are stranded as a result of restrictions introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Image: iStock.The Government has been given approval to send a repatriation flight to Peru to pick up more than 100 Irish citizens who are stranded as a result of restrictions introduced in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Department of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that following a call between Minister Simon Coveney and his Peruvian counterpart “diplomatic clearance” had been secured for the flight to leave at 4pm on Sunday. The Government has been partnering with the UK embassy in Lima in arranging the flight. “Our Embassy in Santiago is in contact with our citizens on the ground in Peru keeping them informed,” the department said.“A large amount of effort is also going into arrangements for the internal transport of our citizens, especially from Cusco to Lima. That remains a very challenging situation and we are doing everything that we can in order for this to take place as planned over the next couple of days.”Around 135 Irish tourists, most of them backpackers, are awaiting repatriation after the Peruvian government ordered the closure of its borders on March 16th as it imposed a strict 15-day national lockdown in response to the pandemic. Around half of them are thought to be outside Lima. Some of the Irish nationals in Peru have reported having to stay in shared hostel rooms for up to 23 hours a day because of the restrictions. The Irish ambassador in Chile, Paul Gleeson, has been coordinating the repatriation effort on the ground. Irish citizens in the cities of Cusco and Arequipa are expected to begin the journey to Lima on Saturday while others face a longer journey to the capital. They have been awaiting details of the flight since Sunday when Mr Coveney said an agreement had been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a plane from Lima “in the next few days”.CautiousGalway native Gearóid McKendrick, who is in Cusco, said he was relieved to hear the flight had been arranged but remained “cautious as we’ve seen other nations being turned back when they are on buses to the airport”. In his communication announcing the flight, Mr Gleeson said officials were aware that some Irish nationals might not be able to leave because of quarantine restrictions. “I’d like to reassure those citizens that we will be continuing to work with EU and UK partners to identify solutions to bring you home as soon as circumstances allow,” he wrote.Rhys McKendry from Belfast said he was worried that he could miss the flight due to the quarantine at his hostel and is awaiting a call from the embassy to update him. “I am still totally in the dark,” he said, adding that he had hoped to take a Covid-19 test to prove he was negative so he could travel. “But I haven’t had any update on testing. Ministry of health instead showed us how to wash our hands, instead of interviewing us as promised.”Irish travellers stuck in Peru contacted by The  have expressed their appreciation for the efforts of Irish diplomats.“In my opinion I think the Irish Government have been doing everything they can behind the scenes,” says Mr McKendrick. “It sounds like the block has been coming from the Peruvian side. Tourists from other countries in Europe stuck here have been receiving the same information from their embassies about limited numbers of planes allowed to come into the country and airspace being closed and that causing complications in organising the flights.”ChallengeFor the department the challenge of getting Irish people stranded abroad because of the pandemic has been unprecedented. Global aviation is currently experiencing the largest shutdown in its history, with airspace across some regions closed off.An estimated 2,000 Irish citizens have been caught up in the crisis. Most are in Australia and New Zealand but diplomats are dealing with cases in 86 countries in total. In recent days the priority has been to try and get as many Irish people as possible onto the rapidly shrinking number of commercial flights.Until next week at the earliest there are no commercial flights permitted in or out of Peru. Frightened by the threat Covid-19 posed to its fragile health system, Peru moved swiftly to shut itself off from the outside world.

Several of those are Aer Lingus flights bound for the US where travel restrictions imposed by the Trump administration mean Irish passport holders will be denied boarding.Department presenceThe Department of Health retains a significant presence at the airport although the role of its officials remains an advisory one and incoming passengers are not being screened for symptoms of coronavirus or being asked to provide details of their movements once they leave the airport.“Dublin Airport is open and operational to facilitate the repatriation of Irish citizens stranded overseas and to enable overseas citizens in Ireland to return home,” said Dublin Airport spokesman Paul O’Kane.“The airport is also open for cargo flight operations which will maintain Ireland’s supply chain and enable the continued import and export of essential products such as medical supplies and pharmaceuticals,” he added.“So far this week, passenger numbers are down by about 90 per cent compared to the same week last year,” he told The .Passenger flights will continue to be facilitated for as long as they continue to operate, he stressed but services were currently subject to change and cancellation and all passengers flying to or from Dublin Airport are being advised to stay in regular contact with airline for details in relation to their specific flight.“Dublin Airport’s future passenger operations will be determined by factors such as Ireland’s travel policies in relation to the coronavirus pandemic, the schedules of our airline customers, and the travel policies of the airport’s main overseas markets,” Mr O’Kane said.“We will continue to keep our runways open during this crisis to ensure Ireland has access to the vital supplies that it needs.”Shops closedThe airport has been making regular public announcements in relation to social distancing guidelines and there are also floor signs in place to encourage our customers to maintain social distancing in all key areas such as check-in and immigration.Virtually all the shops and restaurants at the airport are now closed and all the bars have been closed since before St Patrick’s Day in line with official guidelines. Of the 42 food and beverage operations and coffee docks operating at the airport, just eight remain open.All the retail businesses at the airport have closed and only the Terminal 1 taxi rank is currently operating due to reduced passenger numbers.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4214190.1585336201!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"public service staff urged to only attend workplace where essential","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Public Expenditure and Reform Paschal Donohoe: updated guidelines to public service employers were issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on Friday. File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsPublic service staff should only work in their traditional locations in cases where their organisations consider it essential to have personnel on site, new official Government guidance to managers has urged.The updated guidelines to public service employers issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on Friday said that all employees who could work from home should continue to do so.“Only where organisations deem it essential that people need to attend the workplace should they work on site. This in line with the public health guidance in the Taoiseach’s statement of 24 March to avoid all non-essential journeys and limit social interactions.” “Where employees do not have access to remote working employers should explore every possible avenue of making a suitable arrangement. Employers should continue to explore opportunities for work which can be performed at home, both inside and outside the organisation, as critical services come under increasing pressure.” The new guidelines said that where there were limited opportunities for remote working in an employee’s current role, organisations should seek to identify any staff suitable to be redeployed elsewhere under the Government’s new temporary assignment scheme.“It is a matter for each organisation’s senior leadership team to determine which services are currently essential to business continuity in the context of its organisational business continuity plan, and to identify specific iniduals (including contingency for Covid-19 illnessback-up) required to manage the delivery of these services.” The updated guidance said there was no special paid leave available to public service staff to care for children or others during the current Covid-19 crisis.“All forms of flexible working must be considered including working from home where possible andor working adjusted hours to facilitate employees to balance work and caring responsibilities. Employers should be looking at alternative arrangements eg staggering hours, wider opening hours including weekend work, looking at temporary assignment etc. This will be a standard approach across the entire public sector.”‘As productive as possible’The new guidance said that where a person could not work outside the home and could not perform their current role, he or she would still be considered as actively on duty and available to work.“Employers need to be flexible and innovative in terms of ensuring that their employees remain as productive as possible during this time. If the employer cannot assign work to them remotely, then the employee canwill be assigned work outside of their usual core duties ie potentially a new role, and will be paid, provided they are available for work. There will be temporary assignments in the public sector under the principle of one public service to deal with this crisis. What this means is that any employee can be assigned work outside their usual core dutiesa new role as required by the public service.“Any employee who wishes to avail of existing leave allowances during this time is entitled to have such requests considered by their employer, as always, including parental leave, annual leave etc.”Public service managers were told earlier this month by the Department of Public Expenditure that the virus, also known as Covid-19, was “potentially the most significant crisis faced by our country for many years”. “Our primary focus in the civil and public service is to support the health and wellbeing of all our citizens.”It said public service employees “may be asked on a temporary basis to work in a different role, or even for a different organisation in order to meet critical work needs”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213989.1585323359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"vacant property owners need to answer ireland s call","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCoronavirus pandemic. Tom Gilligan of Mayo County Council says the emphasis of the initiative  would be on sourcing homes for key workers, and to assist people living in overcrowded accommodation. Photograph: Chris IsonPA WireA local authority initiative designed to bring vacant homes back into use is seeking property owners to “answer Ireland’s call” and make housing available for medics returning from abroad.Vacanthomes.ie was developed in 2017 by Mayo County Council on behalf of the local government sector, to allow local authorities to identify empty houses that could be used to help solve the housing crisis.Tom Gilligan, director of services with Mayo County Council, said the emphasis of the initiative during the coronavirus pandemic would be on sourcing homes, on a short-term basis, for key workers such as hospital staff, and to assist people living in overcrowded accommodation.“We are already in the midst of a housing crisis and obviously with the new coronavirus pandemic the need for housing has become more acute.”In particular, he said, doctors nurses and other healthcare workers returning from abroad may not be a position to move in with family members, and could find it difficult to source appropriate accommodation.“People are coming back from abroad to help with this pandemic – medics and other key hospital staff. None of us know how long this pandemic is going to last, and hotel accommodation may not be the most suitable accommodation for them, beyond the very short term, if we want these medics to perform at their best,” Mr Gilligan said.“Those doctors and nurses are answering Ireland’s call. We want to send out a call to property owners who have vacant properties that it is time for them to step up and answer Ireland’s call.”Self-contained unitsVacanthomes.ie is working with the Housing Agency on a proposal to source vacant homes on short-term leases of three to six months to provide accommodation quickly. Mr Gilligan is appealing to anyone with a vacant property to come forward, including student-accommodation providers, where they can offer self-contained rather than communal units, institutional-property investors and large-scale landlords, or even people who have holiday homes.“The 2016 census showed there were 62,000 holiday homes. With remote working, it might be possible for people who live in cities or near hospitals who own holiday homes to instead move to those holiday homes, for the duration of the pandemic, so their houses in Dublin and elsewhere could be rented out to hospital staff for a short term.”The duration of the lease could be restricted to three to six months, but for those with concerns about being able to recover their properties at the end of the term, particularly large-scale landlords, “service level agreements” instead of leases could be established with local authorities, Mr Gilligan said.“We need to be innovative and think outside the box here. We want to look at all the options to maximise the number of homes we can bring into use.”Overcrowded homesIn addition to the need for housing for healthcare workers, there was a concern that coronavirus could spread in overcrowded homes.“We welcome that evictions can no longer take place but some people are still living in overcrowded accommodation, so we also need some of the many vacant homes around the country to help alleviate that pressure.”The reuse of existing homes was likely to become more important if larger housing construction sites began to close down, he said.“We are facing an extraordinary situation, the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes. And we need to look at radical solutions.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213878.1585316787!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"this is not nearly over coveney calls for new government to tackle invisible enemy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney has warned of the need for a new government to tackle Covid-19.

One that is realistic, ambitious and erse. He said part of his priority “now must be finding a way to work with others to design a basis for a government that can command a lasting majority in the Oireachtas”.“It is possible to get it done and it’s possible to get it done quickly.”Opening Friday’s Seanad debate on the swathe of emergency measures passed by the Dáil on Thursday night, Mr Coveney said “this invisible enemy is just beginning to spread through our country and our people”.But he added that “we also know from the experience of others that we can act and those actions can make a huge difference to the spread of this virus and save thousands of lives”.Stressing the need for a new government to combat the pandemic he said Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are working together “through our negotiating team, to shape a process that I hope will encourage others to join us in designing a erse but stable government with a credible mandate not only to lead us through this emergency but also to focus on reimagining and reshaping Ireland for the better as we emerge on the other side.”He said they needed a government that “not only makes the right decisions now in the face of a pandemic, but is also planning for a recovery that can inspire hope and a confidence that we will emerge stronger and more united as a country from this, able to look to the future with optimism based on a clear path forward”.He said Brexit was “a fight for our citizens’ identity and livelihoods.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4213861.1585313856!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"focus on mardi gras as new orleans faces coronavirus nightmare","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Bourbon Street in New Orleans earlier this week.

Photographer: William Widmer via New York TimesYanti Turang, an emergency room nurse at a New Orleans hospital, walked out into the car park in full protective gear early this month to meet a woman with flu-like symptoms who had just returned home after a layover in South Korea. The woman was immediately taken to an isolation room.Around the same time, a man who had never left the country and had been in New Orleans throughout the just-concluded Mardi Gras season, showed up at the ER with a high fever and a dry cough. He was placed in a neighboring room and cared for by hospital workers without any special gear.To everyone’s relief, the woman who had travelled through Asia tested positive for the standard flu. The man, however, did not, Turang said. His symptoms improving but his diagnosis unclear, he was told to take Tylenol and get some rest. And he was sent back out into the city.Turang does not know what became of that man, but he was on her mind two days later when the first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus was announced in Louisiana – another person, at another hospital. The coronavirus had been in the city all along. Since then, the outbreak in the state has become one of the most explosive in the country.According to one study, Louisiana, with more than 2,300 cases as of Thursday afternoon, is experiencing the fastest growth in new cases in the world. State governor John Bel Edwards said on Tuesday that the current trajectory of case growth in Louisiana was similar to those in Spain and Italy. This week, US president Donald Trump approved the governor’s request for a major disaster declaration, which unlocks additional federal funding to combat the outbreak.OverwhelmedThe situation in and around New Orleans is particularly acute, with the city reporting 997 confirmed cases as of Thursday afternoon, more than the total number of cases in all but 13 states. Hospitals are overwhelmed and critical safety gear is running low.Orleans Parish, which shares its borders with the city of New Orleans, has suffered the highest number of deaths per capita of any county in the nation. Of the parish’s 46 deaths – more than double the death toll of Los Angeles County – 11 are from a single retirement home, where dozens more residents are infected.In a grim irony, there is a rising suspicion among medical experts that the crisis may have been accelerated by Mardi Gras, the weeks long citywide celebration that unfolds in crowded living rooms, ballrooms and city streets, which this year culminated February 25th.It is the city’s trademark expression of joy – and an epidemiologist’s nightmare. “I think it all boils down to Mardi Gras,” said Dr F Brobson Lutz Jr, a former health director of New Orleans and a specialist in infectious disease. “The greatest free party in the world was a perfect incubator at the perfect time.” The feeling is at once familiar and distinct for a city whose history is punctuated with epic disasters, including the deadly yellow fever outbreaks of 1853 and 1905, and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Once again, New Orleanians are afraid they could be neglected by national leaders, only this time because the coronavirus is a worldwide calamity.“This hurricane’s coming for everybody,” said Broderick Bagert, an organiser with the community group Together Louisiana. Edwards, who, like most other Louisiana governors, has extensive experience dealing with hurricanes, said the state was struggling to confront this new kind of disaster. “We don’t really have a playbook on this one,” he said. “If you have a flood or a hurricane it’s only a small part of the country that’s affected, so you can get the full attention of the federal government and you can get a lot of help from sister states. That’s not possible right now because this is in every state in our country.”Silent clubsAs a kind of ghostliness settles over a locked-down nation, the effect of social distancing feels particularly jarring in New Orleans, a city that runs on intimacy – from the deep webs of kinship and geography that connect families and neighbourhoods to the fleeting threads that bind strangers and regulars in storied restaurants and packed, sweaty clubs.Now the grand restaurants are offering takeout, if they are open at all. The clubs are silent. Bourbon Street is just another lonely street, its only crowds the hordes of rats that have become increasingly brazen in their hunt for food. But O’Neal blamed no one for failing to take action to limit Mardi Gras festivities. At the time, no cases of the virus had been identified in Louisiana and there were fewer than 50 known cases in the United States. “We were still talking about hand-washing,” she said. Dr Susan Hassig, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, said there were other likely reasons, beyond Mardi Gras, that may explain why New Orleans has been so hard-hit – the dense, compact nature of the city its tourism industry its port, which connects it to the world and the way people connect culturally.“Everybody talks to everybody, which means you stop and you have a conversation and then you move on and have a conversation with somebody else,” said Hassig, who rode in a Mardi Gras parade with the Krewe of Muses this year. ‘Blindsided’Turang, the emergency room nurse, who worked in Sierra Leone during the Ebola epidemic in 2015, said doctors and nurses now talk of the patients who had shown up to hospitals between Mardi Gras and the announcement of that first case on March 9th, people with moderate flulike symptoms who had tested negative for the flu.“We were blindsided,” she said, “by the fact that it was actually here in New Orleans already.” That first confirmed case in Louisiana was announced less than two weeks after shrove Tuesday. Around the same time, reports had begun popping up around the South – Tennessee, Arkansas, Texas – of people who had tested positive after recently returning from New Orleans.The first people to test positive in New Orleans, according to Dr Jennifer Avegno, the city’s health director, had not recently returned from anywhere. But their array of unusual symptoms had troubled doctors. “They just had a sense that something wasn’t right,” Avegno said. “It became clear pretty quickly that there was community spread, that the cases were not directly linked to each other.” Within days, the state’s schools were shut down and large public gatherings in New Orleans were banned – including the huge annual St Patrick’s Day parade, though enough people came out anyway that Saturday to draw the police. A week after the first case was announced, the governor issued an order closing restaurant dining rooms and bars, some of which had to call carpenters to install locks on doors that had not been secured for years.Edwards also limited gatherings to fewer than 50 people. But some have remained defiant, including Tony Spell, pastor at Life Tabernacle Church outside of Baton Rouge, where, according to reports, hundreds of people have been gathering to pray without observing social distancing rules. Spell has called the virus “spiritually motivated” and said that he would heal infected members of his flock by laying hands on them and praying.Surge in casesAs testing ramped up, the number of cases in Louisiana surged. A medical worker at the city jail tested positive, as did a founder of the Grammy-winning Rebirth Brass Band. Sean Payton, the coach of the New Orleans Saints, announced that he had tested positive. The archbishop of New Orleans did, too.The growth rate of new infections in Louisiana was the fastest in the world when comparing areas during the two weeks that followed their first confirmed diagnosis, according to a recent study by Gary A Wagner, an economics professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In a small and close city like New Orleans, that means that nearly everyone knows someone who has been infected. “One of my members, Sister Monica, is on a ventilator,” said Tyrone Jefferson (46), pastor of a church in the city’s St Roch neighborhood. “Another rushed to a hospital yesterday. Two are at home with it.” Doctors and nurses at city hospitals, like hospital workers all over the country, describe a dire shortage of critical protective gear. The Cajun Navy, one of the informal Louisiana volunteer brigades famous for rescuing people from floodwaters, and the Cajun Army have delivered several boxes of masks and gallons of hand sanitiser to medical workers.But the deluge of patients keeps coming. Edwards, a moderate Democrat in his second term, has always been careful about criticising the Trump administration for both political and practical reasons: After a hurricane, there is little use in picking a fight with a federal government that holds the key to disaster relief.On Tuesday, however, Edwards said he would like to see the White House get more involved in the coronavirus response in a way that prioritised harder-hit areas. Ventilators and personal protection equipment should be allocated, he said, “based upon demonstrated need, as opposed to the current situation, where every state, every health care provider, is working the best they can but independent from one another”.Economic devastationAs the disease spreads and sickens those fighting it, a potential shortage of medical workers, particularly nurses and respiratory therapists, is for many the biggest worry. For now, many exposed health care workers – a description that accounts for more than half of the city’s emergency medical technicians – are wearing masks and checking their temperatures but, as long as they are not showing symptoms, staying on the job. The attendant tragedy of the pandemic – economic devastation to a city that lives on tourism and good times – has been following close behind. Most of the city’s tens of thousands of hotel and restaurant jobs do not pay enough for workers to have sufficiently saved for weeks on lockdown, but they pay better than nothing at all.“Our food banks say they’ll be out of food by next week,” said New Orleans mayor LaToya Cantrell, adding that the city was estimating a budget deficit of at least $100 million (€91 million) next year, given the vanishing sales tax revenues. “And,” the mayor continued, “we have hurricane season coming in June.” In his request for a federal emergency declaration, Edwards said that projected hospitalisations would exceed the state’s capacity by April 4th, and that the state had begun contracting to “build out hotels” to provide additional hospital beds. Three state parks have also been outfitted with mobile homes to house more than 300 patients.If hospitals hit capacity, state officials are considering housing noncritical patients at the New Orleans Ernest N Morial Convention Center, which housed thousands of residents who were forced from their homes by Katrina’s floodwaters, and became a symbol of the chaotic response to that disaster.Death tollFor now, the death toll continues its steady climb. A well-known 44-year-old DJ who championed the city’s bounce music scene. A 53-year-old man who drove for Uber and Lyft at Mardi Gras. On Thursday, health department officials reported the death of the state’s youngest known victim, a 17-year-old in Orleans Parish.Ellis Joseph was friends with Oliver Stokes, the DJ, and also with Ronald Lewis, a New Orleans cultural icon who died on Friday of the coronavirus, as a test would posthumously confirm. In another time, Joseph would have walked with his bass drum behind the coffin at Lewis’s funeral procession, leading a brass band in the traditional dirge “Just a Closer Walk With Thee.” Hundreds if not thousands of people would have followed or lined the streets.“I’m going to say a silent prayer for Mr Ronald now and roll for him later,” said Joseph, who is now trying to avoid even going to the store. The funeral was on Monday. In accordance with the current regulations, it was limited to a pastor and nine others. – New York TimesStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: UK deaths rise by 181 in 24 hours as Boris Johnson tests positiveFears for Europe\u0026#39s fresh food supply as border closures hit harvestsGatwick to close North Terminal in attempt to \u0026#39shield business\u0026#39 from coronavirus downturnSocial distancing: new study suggests two metres is not enoughNo 10 blames mix-up in communications for missing deadline to get extra ventilators in EU scheme Elderly people \u0026#39should talk to families about whether they want coronavirus treatment in hospital\u0026#39Duchess of Cornwall warns about dangers of domestic violence during Covid-19 isolationClap For Our Carers: Meet the women behind the moment of national applauseDoubts surface over Chinese virus death toll after thousands of urns spotted in WuhanComment: Defeating coronavirus will be as much a PR battle as a global medical challengeNHS to build two more field hospitals and test its staff for coronavirus, chief executive announcesWilliam, Harry, and coronavirus: A tale of two royal brothers and their reactions to a crisisWhy Covid-19 has spread so fast in the USWhen will coronavirus peak in the UK?  Prime Minister Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus - everything we know so far What essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?Can I drive during the lockdown?

The problem was that, earlier in the day, he had suggested there might be as many as 600,000. Asked to account for the difference, he said his earlier answer had taken into account asymptomatic cases. So what is it? 54,000 or 600,000?Italy is not alone. Earlier this week, the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo published a report into the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in February with more than 800 of the 3,711 people on board eventually diagnosed with Covid-19. According to the report, cited by the Japan Times, four-fifths of those infected showed no symptoms or just mild symptoms. Scans showed their lungs had suffered some physical consequences from the virus, but the patients had not been led by their symptoms to believe they were infected. Quite the reverse.Even in China, the poster child for lockdown and trace tactics which is edging back towards business as usual, there is uncertainty about asymptomatic cases. Estimates are classified. Officials insist all asymptomatic cases are unearthed by so-called contact tracing, yet even if this is true and every such case is detected, the numbers are not trivial: the South China Morning Post obtained details which suggested some 40,000 asymptomatic cases had been discovered in this way. It\u0027s hard not to believe there are many more. One way or another, it is clear that far more of us have, or have had, Covid-19, than the official figures tell us. But how many more? Only mass testing will give us a real picture of what is happening, and thus needs to happen at a far greater rate in the UK than is currently the case:Without mass testing, two very different pictures of the spread of the virus are emerging. On the one hand, there is the optimistic scenario, suggested by an Oxford paper which on Wednesday gained a huge amount of attention for a model suggesting that, given the current state of the UK outbreak, some 68 per cent of the population would have been infected by 19032020 – some 45 million of us, by last week, most presumably without even knowing it.Such a result would be dramatic. The outbreak is overblown, it would confirm. Most of us have already had the disease and are now fine. The NHS has survived the epidemic without even knowing it. But that was just one paper. There is another scenario. This one is that yes, there are lots of asymptomatic carriers (though far from 45 million), but rather than being beacons of hope and joy, they represent hidden problems – mines sown among the rest of us, ready to explode and cause a new outbreak just when it appears we might be on top of this one. According to researchers at the Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (in a paper awaiting peer review), children may represent such mines because only around 20 per cent of them develop clinical symptoms (as opposed to 70 per cent in older adults). Yet it is not yet clear how infectious such largely asymptomatic people are. This critical question must be resolved to effectively forecast and control Covid-19 epidemics, the authors note.Such infection is certainly possible. In Wuhan on Tuesday, the one new case was that of a doctor reportedly infected by an asymptomatic patient. And on the Diamond Princess, studies suggest some of the 20 per cent of infected passengers who  suffered serious symptoms either went several days without obvious outward signs of the condition or caught it from those who never went on to develop serious symptoms.So is the epidemic mostly over or every bit as bad as we think, with the potential to erupt when we imagine we\u0027re through the worst? A single truth emerges: we will only discover the genuine picture through mass blood testing – a simple finger-prick tests that works like this:The testing must be followed, once the outbreak (whatever its true size) is controlled, by picking representative samples in the population to screen regularly, just as such samples are quizzed by pollsters to get a more or less accurate snapshot of national voting intention.In the middle of a mass global outbreak, it seems impossible to carry out whole population testing. Yet fate has twice thrown up unusual circumstances in which this has happened. The Diamond Princess was one such. The other was the 3,000-strong town of Vo, in Italy, where the entire population was tested after one of its citizens became the first to die of the disease.There, too, researchers found a significant proportion of the population (three per cent) had been infected without knowing it, representing the vast bulk of the 89 cases discovered. More generally, in the researchers\u0027 estimation, asymptomatic or quasi-symptomatic subjects represent a good 70 per cent of all virus-infected people.There is good news in this: mass testing in Vo meant there were no further deaths. And factoring in asymptomatic cases also dramatically lowers the disease\u0027s mortality rate, which is currently based only on those who receive tests – usually those showing obvious or severe symptoms. And finally, if you had a fever or a hacking cough earlier in the year and, looking back, now swear you must have had Covid-19 – well, you might just be right.

So while we may not be allowed to enjoy spring sunshine as we usually would (wine on a riverside terrace, beers in a pub garden, cans in the park, whatever floats your boat) there is still plenty to savour when we can venture out.In this spirit, the National Trust urged us all to enjoy the spring blossom on Thursday. Bloom boom time tends to last for about two weeks, a fortnight we’d usually spend commuting, perhaps noticing blossoms only when they’d fallen onto the floor and disturbed our peripheral vision as we gaze downwards at phone screens.We’re all doing more than enough website consumption at home at the moment, so collectively looking up and enjoying the blossom seems a noble aim. Andy Beer, nature expert at the National Trust says: “It’s really easy to take this moment in nature for granted.  Celebrating blossom is a pivotal, seasonal moment that can often be all too fleeting and we want to do all we can to help people and families at home to enjoy and take stock of a special moment in the calendar.While we’re in the mood for enjoying nature, here’s a rare bird that has been photographed for the first time recently:And I would highly recommend the great Joe Shute’s piece today about how self-isolating is turning us all into birders.Here’s Harriet with the rest of today’s reasons to be cheerful.Battersea Dogs and Cats Home reportedly rehomed more than double their usual amount of cats and dogs last week.

For comparison, South Korea, one of the best testers in the world, has carried out 300,000 for its 51 million population, or 1 in 170 people.In South Korea, there is free and easy access to testing for anyone whom a doctor deems needs it, and authorities have been tracing the contacts of infected patients.The picture countrywide, however, is a different one. Nationally, America has tested just 125 people per one million.States have been hit with testing shortages. The lack of kits and testing supplies has led to rationing of coronavirus tests in states like Georgia, Oklahoma and others.We are flying a plane in really foggy weather without radar,” is how one medical expert in Georgia described the situation.Mr Cuomo said New York has carried out 25 per cent of all tests in the country. It has 10 times the number of cases than the next nearest state, neighbour New Jersey.Los Angeles County has been carrying out an average of 500 per day, compared to New York’s capacity of up to 18,000.This suggests that the number of people with coronavirus in America is likely much higher than the official figure.Just look at the map below. New York has nearly 40,000 confirmed cases - half the total for the US, and dwarfing any other major US city.But is the problem just more exaggerated in the state because it is doing more testing? Yes and no.New York has been doing far more testing than any other state, but also if you look at the death toll - 461 - it is nearly six times higher than the next state - New Jersey, which has recorded 81.The stats suggest the problem is much worse in New York than other states. Why would this be?Density is one of the major problems working against it. New York is far more crowded than any other major city in the US. It has 28,000 residents per square mile, while San Francisco, the next most jammed city, has 17,000, according to data from the US Census Bureau. Millions of New Yorkers had until recently been using the subway system, whereas most residents of other cities, like Los Angeles and Washington, DC, drive. That spatial closeness makes us vulnerable, Mr Cuomo said in his daily press conference on Wednesday.Temperature is another factor in the differing rates between New York compared to LA for example, may be the warmer weather in Southern California, a climate that some early analysis suggests may slow the spread of the virus. Regions with average temperatures above 18 degrees Celsius account for fewer than six per cent of global cases so far, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Slow initial response. Mr Cuomo has won much praise for his cool and collected daily briefings, but New York was comparatively slow in enacting measures to help stop the spread. The state was days behind California in ordering schools to close and banning social gatherings.Tourism. New York City is a world-renowned tourist destination and the most visited destination in the US. As such, contagious people from countries that had earlier coronavirus outbreaks travelled to the city and spread the virus.Let’s look now at death tolls to see how lethal the virus has proved to be in the top three affected countries. China recorded a total of 81,897 cases and 3,292 deaths.As of Friday, the US recorded 85,996 cases and 1,304 deaths.Italy has so far recorded 80,589 and 8,215 deaths.The ratio is lowest in the US, however, the outbreak is not considered to have peaked yet here. Experts predict that the US could overtake China in terms of number of fatalities.On the Global Health Security Index, a report card that grades every country on its pandemic preparedness, the US has a score of 83.5—the world’s highest.But the US was slow to react to the outbreak. As you can watch in the video below, President Trump initially tried to downplay the problem, which led to a confusion between state and federal officials.The country then faced a testing shortage, despite being a biomedical powerhouse.As states report increasing numbers of patients, they have complained of a severe lack of masks and ventilation equipment in hospitals in the worst-hit areas.The US also has one of the lowest number of acute care hospital beds per 1,000 people in the developed world - just 2.2. Compare this with Japan, which has nearly eight and Germany, which has six.What is also concerning is the number of states - 15 out of 50 - which are reporting more than 1,000 cases.As testing increases across the US new hotspots have begun to emerge, including in Louisiana. The number of cases in New Orleans has increased by 30 per cent in 24 hours, up to 1,000.China essentially had one epicentre: Wuhan. South Korea initially had just Daegu. Italy has Lombardia and the UK has London. Multiple epicentres is a nightmare for any country. It makes it much more difficult to concentrate resources, but also to contain the problem.Experts have warned the mishandling of the pandemic could cost lives. “As an American, I’m horrified,” said Seth Berkley, who heads Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. “The US may end up with the worst outbreak in the industrialised world.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2020/03/26/TELEMMGLPICT000228537332_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"doctors must make tough decisions whether elderly coronavirus","story":"The government’s former chief scientific adviser, Professor Sir David King, has urged people over 90 not to go into hospital because they are unlikely to survive and will overburden the NHS. It\u0027s fair to say this has been greeted with a degree of controversy. His words in an interview on Radio 4 were blunt, pointing out that “you go into hospital at that age with problems and you may never come out”. But his honesty will resonate with many - including healthcare staff and older people.Despite it being a new disease, the data on covid-19  is clear - older people, and those with serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, are most likely to come off the worst. Demand on the NHS is likely to exceed supply. It is likely to lead to tough decisions about who to treat - and who not to. Contrary to the assumptions of many, doctors cannot be forced into giving ineffective treatment. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation simply does not work for people whose bodies are frail and at the end of their natural lives. Intensive care is a highly invasive treatment which many do not survive. Many medical treatments have always been \u0027rationed\u0027 - from intensive care to transplants - based on rational consideration of who is most likely to benefit. The problem with covid-19 is that it will make these decisions starker.This is not an argument against giving people of whatever age the best treatment. But realistically, that best treatment may be comfort at home, rather than dying in a highly pressured hospital environment. Unless doctors articulate this, the risk is that patients will be given more treatment than they want, or can realistically benefit from, in an unfamiliar clinical environment. Which is potentially both unfair on the patient and an ethical issue - as it leaves fewer resources for people who could benefit from them.   We need to be practical. If hospital care cannot make someone better or more comfortable then they would have been at home, given the realities of this pandemic, the resources of hospitals should be kept for people who could. This might sound harsh. We also need a sense of proportion - most people who get covid-19 will have temporary symptoms and only a few will get seriously ill. But we are all mortal, and we should be open about the reality of death, whether from coronavirus or not. These discussions should not just happen behind closed doors. There needs to be transparency - for both patient and professional protection.Difficult decisions lie ahead. We have got better at talking about death but the coronavirus crisis has thrown a fuzzy subsconcious knowledge of our mortality into sharp relief. When Dr Kate Granger, who died in 2016, tweeted her experiences as she died of cancer, she wrote about the work that needed to be done in order to die peacefully. She had to organise drugs and equipment - prescriptions must be written, then dispensed, and then collected. As I write, several organisations are putting together guidelines for doctors and nurses to use to help people die well at home despite the complications of coronavirus. The risk of infection to others by the dying person will need to be factored and mitigated. Cure sometimes, treat often, comfort always holds true. My experience is that people who are already reaching the end of their natural lives usually want to have as few medical interventions and hospital visits as possible. The problem for medicine is that it treats death as a failure, rather than an inevitable reality. We all need to articulate what we do and don\u0027t want - and doctors must be honest about what is and is not possible.Coronavirus latest news: UK deaths rise by 181 in 24 hours as Boris Johnson tests positiveFears for Europe\u0026#39s fresh food supply as border closures hit harvestsGatwick to close North Terminal in attempt to \u0026#39shield business\u0026#39 from coronavirus downturnSocial distancing: new study suggests two metres is not enoughNo 10 blames mix-up in communications for missing deadline to get extra ventilators in EU scheme Elderly people \u0026#39should talk to families about whether they want coronavirus treatment in hospital\u0026#39Duchess of Cornwall warns about dangers of domestic violence during Covid-19 isolationClap For Our Carers: Meet the women behind the moment of national applauseDoubts surface over Chinese virus death toll after thousands of urns spotted in WuhanComment: Defeating coronavirus will be as much a PR battle as a global medical challengeNHS to build two more field hospitals and test its staff for coronavirus, chief executive announcesWilliam, Harry, and coronavirus: A tale of two royal brothers and their reactions to a crisisWhy Covid-19 has spread so fast in the USWhen will coronavirus peak in the UK?  Prime Minister Boris Johnson tests positive for coronavirus - everything we know so far What essential shops are open during the coronavirus lockdown?Can I drive during the lockdown?

There is no shortage of food, just an excess of demand as people stock up. So far, at least.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhen it comes to making sure everyone is fed, the front line of the fight is not in the pasta aisle at Tesco as shoppers scrap it out for the last pack of fusilli, but in fields up and down the country.British farmers warned this week of a coronavirus-induced labour shortage that could see millions of tonnes of strawberries, cabbages, apples, cauliflower lettuce and more rotting in the fields.‘Green lanes’ could ease shortages of fruit and veg to European shopsFor many years, the bounty of Britain\u0027s agricultural land has been picked and packed mostly by Eastern European hands. Work that years ago used to be the preserve of students making some extra money over the summer is now almost exclusively done by migrant labour.Some of those seasonal workers, mostly from Bulgaria, Romania, a few from Lithuania, are already in the UK but restrictions to stop the spread of Covid-19 mean there is a shortage of about 50,000 seasonal workers, presenting a serious problem for farmers.To plug the gap they have joined forces and launched a nationwide recruitment drive, calling on Britons to Feed the Nation by taking up seasonal roles in the fields. It\u0027s hoped that those who may have lost their jobs as a result of the crisis - chefs, retail assistants, waiters and others - will seize an opportunity for a very different kind of work.So acute is the need that the government is reportedly readying its own Pick for Britain campaign taking inspiration from the Land Army that tilled the fields during the Second World War.\u0026nbspMost places are OK for labour at this point, but in six weeks we\u0027ll be picking, says James Porter, whose family owns East Scryne Farm, a soft fruit farm near Carnoustie, home of the storied golf course on Scotland\u0027s east cost.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If things drag on, the apple harvest could suffer as could vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, celery and cabbage.That would mean more imports of fresh fruit and vegetables. But other countries are experiencing their own problems. In Kenya, a major supplier of Europe\u0027s green beans and peas, Reuters reports that half of workers involved in growing and exporting have been sent home as flights are grounded and prices for freight rise.Spain is Europe\u0027s largest exporter of fruit and vegetables and a big supplier to the UK. But it too relies on thousands of migrant workers, many of them from Morocco, who have also been stranded at home due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.It\u0027s fair to say that British workers have turned their noses up at seasonal farm work in recent years, perhaps partly due to the availability of other, more secure jobs in more comfortable surroundings.It\u0027s hard work and the Eastern Europeans are experienced at what they do, says Oliver Shooter, owner of AE Lenton, which runs a group of farms between Skegness and Boston in Lincolnshire, the centre of England\u0027s vegetable production.It\u0027s not rocket science but it is quite a skilled job that these guys do, he says. A top picker needs to know and apply supermarkets\u0027 exacting standards for exactly how fruit and veg must look, as well as how to cut it and pack it. For that they\u0027ll earn £12 an hour if they\u0027re good. Many farms also provide free or subsidised accommodation.The process is more high-tech than most would probably imagine, says Beverly Dixon, group HR director at G\u0027s, a network of large farms growing salad vegetables across East Anglia.We harvest our products in rigs, little mobile factories that go out into the field. They cut the veg at the front of the machine, it travels along a conveyor belt, gets trimmed, wrapped, boxed and put onto pallets all in one go, ready to be transported.Each rig is manned by a team of 16 who work as a family unit and will be kept apart from others as part of social distancing measures the farm is introducing.G\u0027s is looking for 700 seasonal staff, many of them pickers, but also jobs in packhouses and processing operations, team leaders, quality checkers, tractor drivers, bus drivers, forklift operators, some administrators and a handful of engineers.Bardsley, one of Britain\u0027s biggest apple producers, with an 850-hectare estate in Kent, says that in just a few days since the recruitment campaign launched the response has been overwhelming.Come July, when Bardsley starts harvesting 90 million apples - mostly Royal Gala, Braeburn, Cox\u0027s and the farm\u0027s prize-winning Bramleys - it will need some 500 extra workers. We\u0027ve put out the message on our social media saying \u0027come and join us\u0027, particularly to those people who unfortunately may be out of work at the moment. We are not slowing down, says marketing director Georgia Bardsley.We\u0027ve had such a erse range of people getting in touch. Among them are many who had until recently been working the hospitality sector that\u0027s been hit so hard by the coronavirus, including one head chef.Hopefully it gives people who have been affected a bit of hope, says Bardsley.The company\u0027s agricultural technology director, Antony Yousefian, says he\u0027s quietly confident the farm will find the people it needs. He also sees another potential positive to the situation.We\u0027ve seen a big change in consumers wanting to connect with what they eat in the last few years, he says. What a great opportunity for people to do that.I think, longer term, students will come back to doing this as a summer job.More and more of our jobs are higher skilled.

But those are the headlines the difference lies in the details.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Employees (and employers) will have to wait until the end of April to get their money. For the self-employed, there’s no prospect of the cash coming in until “the beginning of June”.That’s a yawning gap of time for someone to go without income.Why the longer wait? Because the Treasury will have to establish an entirely new scheme to process claims from the self-employed.Officials will have to look at three years of declared self-employment tax returns so they can decide what the appropriate replacement income is for that worker, based on their average earnings.What of those who have only filed returns for one year or two? Officials will, apparently, use their discretion to decide on the right amount of compensation.And those who haven’t yet filed any tax returns at all?The chancellor made it clear they will, unfortunately, have to fall back on the welfare system, albeit one that has been made more generous in recent weeks. For some, that will mean a serious drop in income.And those self-employed who need cash now? They can try to access small-business loans. Or, again, there’s the unemployment benefits system safety net.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And they’ve swallowed a lot of late.It seems that Rishi Sunak wasn’t planning to do anything initially for the self-employed beyond boosting the benefits system.This was never tenable given the fact that this group of workers has grown so rapidly as a share of the workforce in recent years and that they are, on average, less well off than employees.In the past, many would actually have been regular employees but for the perverse incentives of the tax system and cost-cutting employers.Government support for low and middle-income employees but not the low and middle-income self-employed would have been manifestly unjust.The government has – rightly – come a long way in a short time on this.However, with joblessness already rising fast and businesses struggling with the support schemes already set up, it would be rash to bet against ministers having to go further still in the coming weeks of this crisis.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns.

It’s notably used by healthcare workers who need to avoid infection.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I want to thank @rihanna and the Rihanna Foundation for donating Personal Protective Equipment to New York State,” Cuomo tweeted.“We’re so appreciative of your help and that of so many others who have stepped up.”How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe message came a day before Cuomo gave a solemn address from New York City’s Jacob K Javits Concention Centre, which has been turned into a temporary hospital.New York could see a peak in the demand for hospital capacity in three weeks due to the coronavirus, and is planning to build a total of eight temporary hospitals to meet the surge, Cuomo said.Speaking against a backdrop of makeshift hospital beds, the governor also said schools should remain closed for another two weeks until 15 April.Cuomo\u0026nbsphas become a leading national voice on the coronavirus pandemic as the state has accounted for roughly one third of the national death toll and half the known number of cases.He said 44,635 people have tested positive in New York, up about 7,400 from Thursday, and that 519 New Yorkers have died from the virus, up from the previous day’s total of 385 deaths.Cuomo said the state was seeking to build another four temporary makeshift hospitals to add an additional 4,000 beds, which he called part of a plan B to try to make up for a shortage of medical resources.He plans to ask the White House to grant the request to build those additional resources.Additional reporting by ReutersThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

People are going to be waiting for help, likely until May or June as the bureaucracy to deal with this system is put in place.This risks pushing the self-employed into debt or will discourage them from staying at home even when they need to due to ill health.One of the key justifications for providing government funding for self-employed workers\u0027 earnings was to remove the financial incentive to go into work despite the risk of spreading coronavirus.Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, urged the government to introduce a dedicated hardship fund for self-employed people who are struggling while waiting for grants to be made.“Nearly every single call we are taking at our Business Debtline service is from self-employed people affected by the impact of Coronavirus, said Ms Elson.\u0026nbspThe electricians, plumbers and taxi drivers we are hearing from, who cannot work from home, are losing money by the hour – and telling them they can try and access Universal Credit is not enough.Accountants pointed to potential gaps in the new scheme. “The limitations do stand out, said Duncan Swift, president of insolvency and restructuring trade body R3.There are quite a few gaps in the support: for people who have only recently started working for themselves or who pay themselves through idends, there may be no help at all.Payments will be calculated based on each worker\u0027s last three years\u0027 self-assessment tax returns. People with fewer years self-employed will be assessed on the returns that are available.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Frasers has offered its fleet of lorries to the NHS to help deliver medical supplies during the emergency, he added.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsIn hindsight, our emails to the government were ill-judged and poorly timed, when they clearly had much greater pressures than ours to deal with.On top of this, our communications to our employees and the public on this was poor.To reiterate, I am deeply apologetic about the misunderstandings of the last few days. We will learn from this and will try not to make the same mistakes in the future.He added: Our intentions were only to seek clarity from the government as to whether we should keep some of our stores open we would never have acted against their advice.The Newcastle United owner said staff at the retail group are working very hard to save our business so that the company can continue trading after the coronavirus pandemic.Frasers Group is still selling goods online with orders processed at the firm\u0027s Shirebrook distribution centre.Next, River Island and Net-A-Porter are among retailers to have stopped selling clothes online amid fears for the safety of warehouse workers.Asos has also come under pressure after allegations that it has not implemented adequate social distancing measures at its South Yorkshire warehouse.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How much food do you need to eat? How much do you need to store away?\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlines“Please show some restraint,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“There is no shortage of food...

He said he ventured out to the supermarket for the first time in two weeks on Wednesday.The online supermarket boss said Britons should avoid going to supermarkets at peak hours and only buy what they need.He called on Britons\u0026nbspto “make your meals work”.“If you buy a chicken, roast the chicken, have the roast chicken dinner, the following day turn it into a stir fry, the following day make it into soup,” he said.“You can make a relatively small amount of food go a long way and I think we live in a very profligate society today – we buy too much, we eat too much and we have to learn new ways.”Ocado has been operating at capacity during the crisis, and on Tuesday said it had around 10 times more demand for its services than it did before the outbreak began.Some British supermarkets have introduced stricter measures to protect their customers and staff.Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda plan to limit the number of shoppers allowed into their stores at any given time.Tesco boss Dave Lewis has written to customers saying staff will draw new floor markings in the checkout areas, install protective screens on checkouts, and introduce one-way aisles.“Our social distancing plans aim to protect customers from the moment they enter our car parks, to browsing products, to paying and finally exiting our stores,” he wrote.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These customers have priority over all slots.“Our customer careline has been inundated with requests from elderly and vulnerable customers – we have had one year’s worth of contacts in two weeks.“We have proactively contacted 270,000 customers who had already given us information that meant we could identify them as being in these groups,” he said.Mr Coupe, who apologised to regular online customers, said they have already booked in slots for 115,000 elderly, disabled and vulnerable customers this week.Meanwhile, Sainsbury’s said it is temporarily closing 12 convenience stores that have seen “significantly fewer customers in recent days as people are working from home”.The employees will move to neighbouring stores until these stores re-open.Elsewhere, shoppers at Asda have seen changes including markers on the floor to help them keep two metres apart, barriers, signs and announcements. The supermarket has also asked shoppers to ditch cash in favour of card payments.Lidl has announced it will install new donation boxes in store to collect for vulnerable families, extending a scheme that has been in place since 2017.All non-essential stores have been forced to close as Britons are told to stay inside as much as possible, and only leave for supplies and a brief daily exercise.Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, Mr Khan’s spokesman insisted ministers were told “countless times” that Tube frequencies reflect high levels of staff sickness and self-isolation.Shortly before 7am on Wednesday, a senior nurse named Danny posted on Twitter: “Another busy tube. Can we not stagger people’s start times so we aren’t all squashed on the same tube! This is unsafe and not fair!”Barry Trimble, who said his work involves ensuring cancer patients receive chemotherapy, posted an image of a busy Victoria line carriage shortly after 7am on Wednesday.“The Tube is packed, with social distancing impossible. We need more people to stay at home and more trains running in morning and evening peak.”The Tube is currently operating at around 50 per cent of its normal capacity during peak times. Transport for London\u0026nbsp(TfL)\u0026nbsphas pledged to “continue to run as much of a Tube service as we possibly can”.On Tuesday Mr Hancock said: “Transport for London should have the Tube running in full so that people travelling on the Tube are spaced out and can be further apart – obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible.“And there is no good reason in the information that I’ve seen that the current levels of Tube provision should be as low as they are.

Mr Beshear has ordered all non-essential retail businesses closed until the end of a state of emergency, which has also seen him activate the national guard.The governor’s tone remained even throughout his address, but he made clear that the circumstances of the new case had infuriated him.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“My job in these press conferences is to talk to you about how we’re going to get through it — and we are — and that we’re going to do everything we can to protect the lives of those around us.“But this is one that makes me mad.

Similar gatherings have been condemned in other states.In New York, now the epicentre of the US outbreak, a full lockdown has had to be imposed to stop people violating distancing rules. In Florida, meanwhile, CBS interviews showed young college students on spring break openly dismissing the risk of infection while drinking and mingling on the streets. “If I get corona, I get corona,” said one.Mr Beshear clearly has no truck with this behaviour. Laying the potential consequences uncompromisingly at the distancing-defiers’ feet, he had sharp words for them:“We are battling for the health, and even the lives, of our parents and grandparents.

Our nation will never be the same again.So many features of our society will be transformed, from the way we are governed to where we work and how we entertain ourselves.The state will be far bigger and more powerful. Free enterprise will no longer flourish. Welfare dependency, even for businesses, will the new norm.Our social lives will reshape around the home, with travel firms, cinemas and restaurants feeling the burden, while key workers like our NHS heroes will replace narcissistic celebrities in our adoration.And in practice, we will live under a socialist system, where the government has effectively nationalised the entire economy.That dramatic change will be a legacy of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Treasury in the face of the coronavirus challenge.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has recently announced a range of policies that amount to the biggest bailout in history, including a £ billion rescue package for businesses, a massive expansion in the social security system, and an unprecedented subsidy of up to  per cent for wages in the private sector.This vast intervention is on top of the Budget a fortnight ago, in which Mr Sunak announced the biggest increase in public expenditure since the s, as well as a colossal £ billion capital investment fund for infrastructure projects.Great Britain PLC has now been the subject of a takeover by the state.Mr Sunak’s phenomenal splurge is more radical than anything even Jeremy Corbyn proposed at the last election. And the clock will not be turned back.Having tasted economic control on an epic scale, Whitehall and Westminster will be reluctant to give it up.After all, the post-war socialist expansion of the state by the - Labour Government was not reversed for decades, despite long periods of Conservative rule, until Margaret Thatcher came to power in .Recent nationalisations like those of the railways and airlines will remain in place. The public sector will continue to dominate.But the new socialist Britain will be poorer and less dynamic.The services sector, which currently accounts for  per cent of the economy, will take decades to recover from the shutdown imposed by the coronavirus panic.With the collapse of so many businesses, especially in the hospitality trade and retailing, mass unemployment will cast a long shadow.At the same time, record levels of government debt will require huge levels of borrowing and higher taxation.The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis will probably also make our nation more inward-looking and less enthusiastic about globalisation.The barriers that are now going up around Europe will remain in place, while Britain is likely to impose stronger border controls.Immigration, currently running at over , new arrivals every year, is bound to plummet, especially when shrunken firms cannot claim to need cheap foreign labour.The international travel industry will continue to struggle once the crisis is over, with clients fearful of health risks.With reduced activity, it seems doubtful that the third runway at Heathrow Airport will ever be built.Ruined airlines and cruise companies will look back on pre-corona days as a golden age, though domestic tourism may receive a boost from the greater number of Brits holidaying at home.The Covid- catastrophe has exposed how fragile our inter-connected world really is.In an attempt to reduce our vulnerability, Britain is likely to become far more self-sufficient by strengthening our domestic supply lines, rebuilding our manufacturing base and bolstering the agricultural sector.Similarly, our dangerous dependence on Chinese contractors for everything from nuclear power to broadband technology will end.Future governments will be reluctant to reach the kind of deal that Boris Johnson recently did with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to play a key role in the expansion of the G network.One key result of the Covid crackdown has been to show businesses that it is perfectly possible for a signicant number of their employees to work from home, thanks to the web.This trend is bound to gather pace even when the crisis has passed.The huge increase in home working will herald a long-term decline in the office, for so long one of the symbols of our sophisticated civilisation.And the consequences of such a change will be enormous.Commercial property, which is estimated to be worth around £ billion in Britain, will drastically fall in value.Commuting by road or rail will become far less common, leaving trains emptier and roads less congested.For the first time since rail privatisation, passenger numbers will drop signicantly.Nor will there be any justication for huge, expensive transport projects like the £ billion HS rail link or the vast proposed new £ billion Lower Thames crossing, linking Kent and Essex by road.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.In a culture dominated by home working, expensive city living will lose much of its appeal.Already overblown, property bubbles in fashionable hotspots like London and Manchester could soon burst.Yet, while the urban housing market runs into deep trouble, coastal and rural regions may well see a revival.Will Margate be the new Islington On a more profound level, the shock of the present crisis will leave us more oriented towards our homes and family le.We will be less obsessed with eating out, more focused on home entertainment. TV streaming services will grow rapidly. Cinema chains will shrink.Hardly any area of British le will be free of the covid revolution’s impact.Throughout the academic world, there will be more respect for valuable, practical subjects like science, engineering and medicine - and less for academic pursuits like media studies.In politics, there is likely to be less partisanship and more consensus, as highlighted by the remarkable praise heaped last week on Mr Sunak by the TUC for his bailout.In a shell-shocked country, trying to recover from economic meltdown and social lockdown, there won’t be much time for isive fads, poisonous identity politics or invented victimhood.Shrieking about safe spaces will sound like pathetic self-indulgence in a society where thousands are likely to have died from the Corona killer.What could be beneficial for Britain is a fundamental rethink about the values of our age.The health crisis has graphically revealed who really matters when it comes to the le-and-death crunch.As the death toll mounts, it is not the property speculators, lawyers, quango chiefs, and hedge fund managers that keep our country going, despite their vast financial rewards.It is the NHS staff, the care home workers, the retail assistants, the emergency services personnel, the lorry drivers and the shelf-stackers, many of whom have limited earnings.Perhaps in the new Britain forged by the coronavirus, we will lavish more on our carers, and less on our celebrities.Out of the current despair, we may come to recognise our real priorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That figure includes  per cent of Conservative voters and  per cent of Labour voters.What’s more, only two per cent of the public said they don’t intend to follow the new rules.His personal favourability rating has skyrocketed too.So how has the Prime Minister achieved the type of public support that most leaders during any era of our history could only dream of Because he made it clear he was desperate not to impose these measures.We support Boris introducing draconian rule over our lives now because it’s obvious that doing so is his worst nightmare.He started slowly, initially allowing schools to stay open and football games to still be played based on scientic advice.But as the modelling changed and the threat to le became very real, our willingness to comply dramatically increased too.Only time will tellhe did too much too soon or too little too late. However, I am prepared to say on the record that the measured response was the right one.The British public, who have been brave enough to put their lives and ideology to one side, will be horried to learn that leaders within the Labour party have tried to snf out a political opportunity here.Labour party chairman Ian Lavery has been caught by the Guido Fawkes website plotting to use the coronavirus crisis as what he disgustingly calls a “great opportunity”.He said: “By the way when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour Party members, community champions out there a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it gets people together. We need to make sure that we do that, and community organising what a great opportunity it’s going to give us.”How revolting.The coronavirus pandemic is not a great political opportunity, Mr Lavery.It’s an international tragedy of epic proportions that will cause grief for many and economic catastrophe for years to come.It’s caused someone I know to lose a dear relative before their time. It’s caused weddings to be cancelled, jobs to be lost and le savings to go down the drain.It’s not a “great opportunity” for anyone – and Lavery should immediately apologise for such a smear. Or resign.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But as the disease relentlessly spreads and deaths soar, it will not cope without a monumental national effort of a kind not seen for  years.The exhausted doctors and nurses on the frontline, dealing with stricken or recovering patients, now need the support of an army of , volunteers. If you are in good health and unable to work, why not join them It has been moving beyond measure to witness the , retired or former medics, nurses and pharmacists rejoining the NHS to fight this disease.They could be safe at home. Instead they have put themselves in harm’s way. That takes great courage and public spirit. MPs may not be popular these days, but those workers include Tory Maria Caulfield and Labour’s Dr Rosena Allin-Khan. We salute both.And we wish luck to the , final-year doctors and , student nurses who, at the very start of their careers, are tasked with tackling the gravest public health crisis in a century.They and all their colleagues should know, from the thousands of “I Love NHS” messages pouring into us from Sun readers, how grateful the nation is.Millions are doing their bit just by staying home. Many are going the extra mile to help friends, neighbours and OAPs who are self-isolating. Some, with their own jobs in peril, have poured money into good causes close to ruin.For their part, some of our businesses are repurposing factories to produce ventilators and other vital supplies.Now, the Government is asking every one of us to volunteer for the NHSwe can. Together we can help the health service beat this virus and restore some semblance of normality while minimising casualties. And it is desperately urgent.As the latest heartbreaking death toll shows, this crisis is likely to get much worse before it gets better. THE eerie, deserted streets tell their own story. Britain has begun to listen and obey.More than  million of us watched Boris Johnson’s stark, historic address to the nation — among the highest TV audience figures ever. And it hit home.Yes, there were still some crammed carriages on London’s depleted Tube yesterday. There is still confusion over some of the guidance and rules — and more clarity would be welcome.But there WILL be mistakes and inconsistencies from the Government. It is having to react minute by minute to a sudden, global catastrophe. It cannot cover off every inidual situation. We all have to use our common sense too.The vast majority of people get that.

We were high on euphoria and expectation before the inevitable responsibilities and occasional disappointments of adult le set in.For me, it meant a week in Tywyn, Wales, in the caravan of my friend Mandy’s mum and dad, followed by a summer job in Littlewoods and Sundays spent hanging around the local rec with my mates while passing round a warm, spittle-filled bottle of budget cider.Ah, those were the days. Today’s kids are more likely to be drinking canned Pinot Grigio at an American-style prom party before heading off on a family holiday to Spain, but the sense of closure they feel at the end of exams is exactly the same. It’s a rite of passage.So for all those GCSE and A-level students for whom Covid- has put paid to that “end of exams” feeling, I have nothing but the utmost sympathy.Last Wednesday I was on a dog walk with my youngestwhen news came in that her GCSEs were off.It’s tempting to think that she and the rest of Class  might have whooped with joy at this unprecedented cancellation of national exams, but that would be to sorely underestimate the level of pressure placed on their generation to get a qualication that will elevate them out of the in-tray of le and into paid employment.Like the Olympic athletes who’ve spent the past few years training for that one event in Tokyo that has been postponed until next year, our kids have been preparing for exams that their parents and teachers have drummed into them are so critically important to their future.So forgive them , despite the deaths that give perspective to the little things that many of us find frustrating about this plague on all our houses, they allow themselves a spell of feeling deeply sorry for themselves.They will now be given “predicted” grades — though the Government is still frustratingly vague on the exact detail of how they will be decided upon.There has been some suggestion that mock results might be a factor but, let’s face it, they’re rarely taken seriously at the time and never match the grades kids get in the real thing. So let’s hope they come up with something fairer.Either way, it’s going to be potentially fraught with pitfalls.“I wanted to earn my grades,” the youngest said, plaintively, the other day. “Now I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing.”I reassured her that, one day, knowledge such as “changes to Tanzania’s economy through private and foreign investment” , “the formation of polyesters through the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monomers and diol monomers”and “parallel and collinear vectors”might come in handy when, ten years from now, she’s at a pub quiz. Or maybe not.Which brings me to my final point on this unprecedented cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels.The latter are fine as they are, but perhaps those in the upper echelons of education could use this time of isolation to take a long, hard look at GCSEs and whether they are fit for purpose in the modern world Most kids know their subject strengths and weaknesses by the time they’re  so, aside from basic maths and English, which prove useful whatever your chosen employment, do they really need their heads crammed with often obscure information that,needed in later le, they could simply look up on Google Better, surely, to teach them vital le skills such as entrepreneurialism, money management, how to compose an impressive CV and do well in job interviews Like a reverse version of a minute’s silence, it’s to show our hard-working NHS staff how much we appreciate their efforts at this deeply challenging time.So whether you do it in a garden balcony windowbox or post it live on social media, put your hands together and show that we care about them too.MADONNA has posted an, er, inspirational Instagram video of herself ponticating on the Covid- plague while luxuriating in a bath full of rose petals.Her Madgeness declares: “That’s the thing about Covid-. It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.“It’s the great equaliser and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it.”Hmmmm. Nice sentiment, but the reality of self-isolation for the majority brings to mind the famous quote from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”Be it the Queen Of Pop, with her vast mansion and multi-million dollar nest egg to see her through these trying times, or The Queen with her “skeleton staff of eight” – being in lockdown is far nicer when you’re wealthy.But when there’s loads of you in a pokey space and with no discernible means of paying next month’s rent, it’s not so “great”. GOVERNMENT advice on who should be doing what and when is still a little woolly.And where there’s potential loopholes there are those who will either misunderstand or willfully exploit them.Step forward Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who, post-lockdown, told his staff they should turn up for work before being publicly shamed in to telling them to stay home after all.But with cycle shops being allowed to stay open, he could perhaps mitigate that as he’s in the business of sports equipment, he thought the same rule applied to his business too.­Similarly, while the building work on one house near me has ceased, another is still ongoing with at least eight construction workers – all of whom will have either shared a van or taken public transport to get there.So one suspects the Government is going to have to ramp up the “lockdown” rhetoric to make it clearer exactly what is deemed essential and what’s not.Meanwhile, I’m going to exploit this small pocket of vagueness by hopping on my bike and heading to the local pharmacy for a packet of hair dye, not least because it comes with a handy pair of disposable gloves.As the Donald Trump meme shows above, no one wants to see that much harsh reality.THE closure of McDonald’s prompted s of people to queue round the block for one last Big Mac.They shouldn’t worry.Given that a man in Utah claims to own the world’s oldest McDonald’s burgerand it shows no sign of decay.All those desperate McAddicts could have bought  of them and they’d still be edible at Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It has just taken this crisis to give us all a wake-up call to realise what is most important — our family, our friends and our fellow human beings.In my street we have set up a WhatsApp group so we can all help each other out getting shopping, medicine and simply checking to seeeveryone, especially the elderly and those living alone, are doing OK.And tens of thousands of you have heeded the Government’s call and volunteered to help deliver medicines and supplies to vulnerable patients on lockdown.I have signed up to have a chat with anyone who needs a bit of reassurance.Cab drivers are giving pensioners free transport. LA Taxis in Newcastle picked up dozens of elderly people to take them to the local supermarket and back home again with their essentials.Our youngsters have also been amazing.James Burnett, , from Grimsby, set up a Facebook group to connect people who want to help — and thousands have joined.He has also been taking sandwiches to his local hospital with sister Ellie-Mae, , and brothers Robbie, six and Oscar, four. I know hungry NHS workers enduring gruelling long shts are so grateful to these big-hearted youngsters.It truly brings a tear to my eye and I am so proud of all these thoughtful acts.To raise my spirits, I go for a daily walk with my little dog Angus. I do not see as many people as usual — and I obviously keep a safe distance from any I do — but I have seen a real change in attitude.Everyone now shouts a cheery greeting or exchanges a rueful smile and wave.There is a real sense of us all being in this together.Like many of you, I have been feeling anxious and unsettled, but focusing on the positives has been keeping me sane.YOU are our heroes daily!!! Thank you!!! We love you.KURT RIEMERYOU’RE all truly amazing.SOPHIA GODWINMaybe, just maybe, all of these small but important acts of kindness and that renewed and revitalised community spirit will continue when the virus has been defeated. And remember: We will get through this.In the meantime, it will be more bearablewe all take care of each other.What a wonderful day it will be when we are able to embrace all of those we love and hold them tight to our hearts.­To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

because it needs to pass trials before being certied as safe to use.Usually, drugs and vaccines are tested in phases before they approved for human use.The first involves safety testing where a small group of people are given a dose to see how they react.Phase two sees more people tested while scientists work out the right dosage.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

and should anything happen they would receive excellent care in state of the art facilities.Volunteers would also have the risks fully explained to them so that they can make a decision about going forward.MPs heard yesterday that several coronavirus vaccines are being developed and could be available in six months.Prof Andrew Pollard, from Oxford University told the Commons science and technology committee that the timeline depended on trials going well and production sites being expanded.However, he admitted a timescale of  to  months was more likely.The jabs would protect high risk groups such as the sick and elderly who are currently being shielded at home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cross-contamination is rampant. The animal cruelty is off the scale.Bears, tigers,  wolf cubs, crocodiles, hedgehogs and turtles are not spared in this notorious wildle food trade, either.Now the despicable wet markets used by some Chinese people — markets already responsible for the Sars outbreak in  — have finally brought the world to its knees.Scientists have established that it is highly likely Covid- was linked to a notorious live animal market in Wuhan.Gene sequencing analysis shows the new coronavirus probably started in bats and was transferred to humans via the scaly anteater the pangolin.So why is there so little outrage about the wet markets that we know have the potential to cause catastrophic outcomes to human health Even Donald Trump — slammed for branding Covid- the “Chinese virus” — avoided criticising the wet markets when prompted during a press conference at the White House on Wednesday.Maybe that’s because the moment someone tries to speak up they are accused of racism.That happened to reality star and retail entrepreneur Luisa Zissman earlier this week when she posted a video on Instagram of a wet market and called for them to be “banned completely”.After the usual social media outrage, she told me: “I wholeheartedly disagree with this particular part of Chinese culture, but that does not make me racist.” It should be remembered there are many campaigners within China desperately trying to get the wet markets banned too.After all, the addition of more exotic animals only dates back to the s, as the ruling communist party struggled to feed the population and million people perished in what became known as the great famine.By , the ironically named Wildle Protection Law encouraged industrial-level breeding of the likes of bears, bats and turtles to be sold through wet markets. And that’s when the viruses began to form.When the Sars crisis was linked to a wet market in southern China, officials shut it down and made wildle farming illegal. But they reversed the decision just a few months later.As of  it was a £billion industry, mainly because the rich and the powerful pay copious quantities of money to eat rare wildle as they believe  claims about their role in Chinese medicine.Now with coronavirus spreading, the government has again temporarily banned wildle trading and shut down wet markets.But it’s not permanent yet — and it must be.We already know that the early Chinese cover-up of Covid-, which makes Chernobyl look like a misdemeanour, resulted in the disease’s rapid spread.In fact,China had taken early action experts reckon the number of coronavirus cases could have been cut by  per cent, making its rampage all over the globe far less likely.The new illness was directly linked to the infamous wildle market in Wuhan on December , but it wasn’t until New Year’s Eve that the World Health Organisation was informed and the site closed.The brave Chinese doctors who tried to spread the word about Covid- were shut down by the authorities too, and early testing was stopped and samples  destroyed.I have no doubt the Chinese government has blood on its hands over coronavirus.And saying that now, at the peak of the health crisis, is not the time to tackle the issue is wrong.We must have this uncomfortable discussion while our anger is raw and the pain  all too real.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.I DON’T have enough superlatives to describe my adoration for Lady Gaga.No pop star of her generation has been more consistently savvy, smart or, for that matter, talented.So it pains me to so deeply disagree with her decision to delay the release of her highly anticipated new album Chromatica, which was due to drop on April , in the middle of quarantine hell.In fact, I actually think the delay is quite selfish.Thanks to the technological advances in streaming, listening to new music is one of the few activities we can engage in collectively without having to leave the house. Gaga wrote that: “It just doesn’t feel right to me to release this album with all that is going on during this global pandemic.”Instead she wants us all to focus on “finding solutions”, such as providing medical equipment and school meals.All very good aims, of course.But what the world also needs now is music, sweet music, to unite us and, frankly, distract us.She’s also made a strategic error, given she had a captive audience with time on their hands at home to stream to their heart’s content.This is the time for the UK to show that, eight decades on, we still have the Blitz spirit in our blood.Many of our parents or grandparents were sent to the front line to fight Hitler.All most of us have to do is put our lives temporarily on hold while scoffing Domino’s pizza and watching Netflix.I don’t for a second underestimate the signicance of such a call, by the way.These are dark days and there is a growing coronavirus-shaped cloud over our daily lives right now, causing extreme stress and anxiety.It’s so easy to feel angry and uncertain and tearful and depressed.Like you, I’ve been through the gamut of emotions while practising social distancing.However, that is simply not an excuse not to try to  carry on with your normal lives.It won’t be for ever. In fact, the sooner we do this properly, the sooner this nightmare will be over.At such a trying time it is imperative we celebrate the brilliant work being done by so many to keep society running.So thank you to the doctors, the nurses, the NHS workers, the first responders, the supermarket staff, the cleaners, the bus drivers, the Tube staff, the delivery drivers, the journalists and anyone  who NEEDS to keep working to keep our society going.They’ll thank the rest of us for doing our part too and staying indoors.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Today, he busts some myths surrounding the coronavirus – and gives tips on how everyone can help to prevent its spread . . .Q: I’ve heard hot drinks can kill the virus. Is this correct A: There is absolutely no truth whatsoever in that, unfortunately. People are reading all sorts of information and perhaps they have got this from the fact the virus is affected by high temperatures. But hot drinks would have no effect on the virus in the eyes and nose, which is often where it gets in. There is also no evidence hot drinks could prevent the virus or make it more mild.Q: Will the UV light from the sun help stop the coronavirus A: Ultraviolet light can weaken and kill the virus because UV radiation can destroy lots of microorganisms. That is why it is OK for people to go out in the fresh air and exercise — but not in groups of more than two people from the same household. Butyou already have the virus in your nose and throat UV light won’t have any effect.Q: You said you shouldn’t take ibuprofen. Ginger has anti-inflammatory properties too. Is it still safe to eat it A: Herbs such as ginger and garlic do have anti-inflammatory properties but the effects are so mild they would not have an appreciable effect. There is no reason to avoid culinary herbs.Q. If I get the virus, what should I do A: Stay at home and self-isolate for seven daysyou live alone or for  daysyou live with other people. Treat your symptoms as you would with any other upper-respiratory infection. Take paracetamol to help bring down your temperature, use cough medicine to help ease your cough, use lozenges or a spray for your sore throat, andyou have a bunged-up nose, use a decongestant. Drink plenty of fluids.Q. Should I still take my child for their routine vaccination A: Yes, you should still take your child. Routine immunisations continue to protect children from all the usual infections. They are being held in a safe clinical setting.Q. I am heavily pregnant and due to have my baby in hospital in a few weeks. Is this still safe A: Antenatal and obstetrics care is continuing. All midwery teams are taking every precaution for services to continue as normal. No one needs to be frightened going into hospital to have a baby. Hospitals are a safe clinical environment and you will be discharged as soon as is appropriate and practically possible.Q: We are waiting on a cancer diagnosis for our daughter. Will they delay starting treatment because of the virus A: No. Serious and emergency treatments will continue despite the virus outbreak. This cannot be postponed.Q: The streets are now full of runners and some push past me on the pavement. Can they pass the virus through their sweat A: This is a respiratory virus, transmitted through droplets in the air we breathe out and through sneezing. Our hands can be contaminated and when we put our hands to our face that’s how the virus gets into the body. Sweat and blood are not thought to transmit the virus.Q: I’ve always had a weak immune system and I seem to catch everything going. How much at risk am I A: There is no evidence that people who are prone to catching ordinary colds are more susceptible to coronavirus. Just take the necessary precautions and keep on physically distancing from others.Q: I ride a motorbike. Is there any reason I can’t A: In theory there is no reason why you can’t continue to ride. But the main risk is of you getting injured and requiring hospital treatment. Certainly, the last thing we want to do is overload the NHS with injuries that can be avoided so keep the consequences of what you do in mind.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: My husband is a self-employed gardener working on his own. Is he safe to go to do someone’s garden when he has no contact with the people A: While it sounds very strict, the Government’s advice is now clear. That is that everybody should stay at home unless their work is absolutely essential. Evenyour husband’s work involves travelling by car on the road, needing to fill up with petrol for example, that increases human-to-human contact, which is how the virus is transmitted.Q: I’m  and a volunteer driver for cancer patients. Is it safe for me to still be doing my voluntary work A: While you do a wonderful job, your age puts you in the vulnerable category and you should stop doing what you’re doing. We now have more than , NHS volunteer responders who will all be younger than you and can take up this kind of work. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

either positive or negative - within as little as two and a half hours.At the moment, most of the commonly used tests take at least  hours to deliver a result following laboratory analysis.Dr Jochen Rupp, a Bosch product manager, told the : “It’s all automatic – stick in the swab and seal it – and it saves interminable transportation routes.“It’s very simple and, with minimum manual work, the doctor gets the result direct, day or night – negative or positive – and can react directly and quickly.”The device can also dferentiate between coronavirus and nine other infections that cause similar symptoms, such as seasonal flu.Its already in use at clinics near Boschs headquarters in Stuttguart and will be made more widely available in Germany next month.There are also plans to distribute the technology - which was created in just six weeks with help from Northern Irish diagnostics company Randox Laboratories - across the rest of Europe.Marc Meier, managing director of Boschs healthcare ision, said: We have succeeded in developing an innovative test in a very short time, which can contribute to curbing the global spread of the coronavirus.The particular quality of the Bosch test is that through its dferential diagnostics doctors can spare themselves the time they would otherwise spend on further testing.The company refused to say how much each test would cost or how many machines it would manufacture. It also failed to specy its tests  positive rate - which means the number of samples that are wrongly identied as containing coronavirus.Boschs Vivalytics device relies on very similar methods to other tests - polymerase chain reactions, also known as molecular photocopying.When a swab is taken from a patient, the strands of genetic material are copied, passed through a detector and compared against other genetic sequences.Germany is carrying out , coronavirus tests a week, which is the equivalent of more than , of the devices operating for  hours a day.In the UK, testing is being carried out at a much lower rate of around , a day.Last week the test numbers topped , but then fell to a low of ,.As of am yesterday, a total of , people have been tested, of which , were confirmed negative and , were confirmed positive.The government has promised that tests for current viral infection, will reach ,.It also announced that it had bought . million antibody tests which can determine whether someone has already had coronavirus.When a person gets infected by the virus, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies to fight the infection.The new finger-prick test looks for these specic antibodies in the blood to determine whether that person is immune.Once the tests are available, NHS staff and key workers -

We’ve been told that within  hours we’ll at least have a plan, so that’s some optimism.But it’s still a worry, how we’re being exposed. In some cases, the protection is not adequate.We had news of the first GP to possibly have died of Covid- today. It’s tragic – we were bound to see it at some point. It won’t be the last case.As this thing grows, we’re going to get more health workers exposed, just like in Italy, because they’re on the front line.It’s very easy to be gloomy and doom-mongering about the pandemic, but overall I have a sense of optimism.We’ve got some tough weeks ahead, we know that, but in the long-term we’ll come through this crisis.General Practice will also have learned some new ways of interacting with patients that will probably make the NHS better in the long term too.Doctors have learned how to do video consultations so hopefully we’ll see less of the queues outside surgeries on a Monday morning.And last night’s applause was great too. It made the hairs stand up on the back of my neck.It feels like the NHS has the support of the nation.Kirsty Gage, , is a childminder from Kettering, Northamptonshire. She lives with partner Lewis and their -month-old son, Tommy.She says: “Yesterday, we spent all day in the garden.I gave the kids cups of water and a paint brush and they did some painting, they played on the bouncy castle and slides, we played Bear Hunt and we had lunch outside.It was actually good fun and they loved it butit gets cold again, it will be harder to keep them happy.I was gutted to hear the Government announcement last night, about help for the self-employed.It’s great that they are paying  per cent of wages for some but I am not entitled to it as I only started last May so I haven’t filed a taxyet.I’m right back to square one. It seems really unfair. There are other ways I can prove my income.I do monthly invoices for parents, we have proof of bank transfers and contracts.I was a teacher for four years so I’ve always paid my dues. It’s really disappointing.I tried applying for Universal Credit but when you try and upload the necessary documents, it crashes because the site is overloaded.I tried ringing and left a message. I managed to talk to the mortgage company and they said we could freeze our mortgage for three months but there would be extra charges and they can’t tell us what they are yet.Now I’m worried that whatever they charge will put us in a trickier position long term.They should have sorted this by now, because it’s more uncertainty for us.I’ve lost £, a month in income and I feel really let down.”Shannon Summerfield, , is a support worker with not-for-profit Dimensions in Cardf.

I was outside and there were fireworks going off and pots and pans.We didn’t knowpeople would take it seriously and go out and actually do that. To hear those people clapping was really, really nice.I do feel a lot better than I did at the beginning of the week – I still think the lockdown was the right thing to do.I hope people will stick to what’s being said and what’s being expected of them. People are working very hard for the NHS.I just hope it doesn’t go on too much longer.My mum, a nurse, had some news yesterday – she might be working on a coronavirus ward.She might have to stay in a hotel to keep me and my sister safe. I wasn’t too happy because obviously I can’t see anyone as it is, and my mum is always there.She might be working with people who’ve tested positive and keeping them safe.Because she works shts it might mean I don’t see anyone in my own house for days.

We’re as fully prepared as we can be and none of us really know what’s round the corner.Hopefully the measures Boris Johnson has put in place will help the numbers stay down.The lockdown is being well observed and everyone is being so considerate, phoning aheadthey need to come in, or conducting everything by phone.Yesterday, my colleague Clare had a client bring in a goody bag for her, full of sweets and juice.She said, ‘I know you’ve had some dficult calls to make this week and you’ve been great, so I wanted to give you a little treat.’Clare was quite emotional about it and I thought that was lovely.We’ve had so many clients expressing their appreciation across the board which means a lot.The clap for the NHS, last night, was a really emotional gesture too.I meet a lot of NHS staff in my work and they do an amazing job.

For me, because I have some savings, I’m covered for now.But for a lot of guys, this is going to force them back out and working, it’s a battle between morals and looking after yourself money wise.I’ve got the option – but some people don’t.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailThis is Mr and Mrs Jones. He is an engineer, she is a florist. They have two children, one car, and a mortgage. He was made redundant from a petrochemical company two years ago. He used the money to set up his own firm, and had a big idea for a pollution-free carburettor. To start with, he worked as a taxi driver to make ends meet. He earned £, that first year. Then he had an idea for a device that would enable people to fry sausages evenly, and sold it to a manufacturer. They gave him £,, so he and his we traded in their -year-old Peugeot for a new estate, putting down a deposit and agreeing a finance deal for the rest. In the past  months Mr Jones has paid his income tax, idend tax, and corporation tax. He has carried on designing his carburettor, drives the taxi at weekends, and has had little other income.In early March, the florist closed because of coronavirus. Mrs Jones was laid off a week before the government announced a furlough scheme which would have got her % of her salary - which was only £,, and part-time, anyway.Mr Jones paid last monthaposs £ mortgage, but has just heard the government wonapost be giving him anything, either. The Chancellor says he canapost be helped, because they donapost know enough about him - even though heaposs paid tax for nearly  years.  Mr Jones is cross. He cannot get through to his bank. He applies online for a mortgage holiday, but has no ideaitaposs even been received.Mr and Mrs Jones isolate when theyaposre told to. She starts home-schooling the children. Mr Jones starts doing shopping deliveries for his neighbours. It costs him £ a week in petrol. They hope for the best, and decide to treat it as quality time with their family.At the end of the month, there is a £ council tax payment. There is a £ car payment. There is a £ electricity bill, which has shot up because theyaposre all at home, and £ water rates to pay. Mr Jones got his mortgage holiday, but no holiday from everything . He decides to pay it all except the credit card, which they had to use during that year he left work and have steadily been paying down. The next month, there is a red credit card bill. Mr Jones cancels the car payment and the council tax. Mrs Jones is trying to make each meal last for two meals, to save money. The children are arguing. Mr Jones spends more time alone, tinkering with his carburettor. Mrs Jones starts to get cross with him.The next month, there are red credit, car and council tax bills. The oldest child racks up a £ phone bill, and Mr Jones hits the roof. He decides to stop delivering shopping to his neighbours. He gets cross when they ask for help, and tells them to bugger off. He and Mrs Jones have lots of arguments about money. She asks him to self-isolate in the spare bedroom. Mrs Jones is told her first mammogram is being cancelled. She does not know it, but it would have caught a small tumour nice and early. It grows, instead. Mr Jonesapos mum, who lives a long way away, becomes ill with coronavirus, then dies. His sister becomes ill, but survives. Her teenage son does not. Mr Jones is not able to go to the funerals, due to the distance and cost of petrol. Mr Jones starts drinking. Now his children are cross with him too. When the government announces the lockdown is over, she takes them to stay with her mum. Mr Jones drinks more. He has started putting the red bills in a cupboard. He doesnapost sleep. His neighbours do not speak to him anymore. But his old employers at the petrochemical company give him a short-term contract. Mrs Jones has her delayed mammogram. The tumour is found, but while before sheaposd have just needed pills now she needs surgery. It makes her re-evaluate things. Afterwards, she trains as a nurse. Thereaposs a shortage, after so many died. Mrs Jones meets a nice man, who doesnapost drink, and isnapost in despair. She goes home to ask her husbandthey can try again. He is bitter and angry, worried about all the things he canapost control. They argue, she says sheaposs met someone but nothingaposs happened, and he hits her. The  call costs £., the trip to hospital £, and police call-out and advice £,.She leaves with two suitcases, and does not come back. Mr Jones cries, and drinks some more. The orce is simple, because she doesnapost want anything and he hasnapost got much anyway. It still costs him £,. The economy recovers, a little. But then the crisis hits a peak in the USA, with , dead. The virus starts spreading through Africa, with the worldaposs supply of raw materials halted. The petrochemical company does not renew Mr Jonesapos contract. Bailfs take the car. The bank which was too busy to talk to Mr Jones when he needed it now calls him twice a day. The local authority want him to tell a magistrate why he didnapost pay his council tax. The phone is cut off, as well as the electricity and the gas. The Jones children do not want to talk to him, but he could not Skype or ring them anyway.  He goes and stands outside the house they are now living in with the nice man. The police call out costs another £,, the legal aid lawyer £, and  hours in custody another £. He accepts a caution.His application for Universal Credit came through. He decides to spend half on food, and half on Scotch, as he does not eat when he is drunk. There is not enough for him to even think about paying the bills.Mr Jones drinks a whole bottle. Then he finds an enormous pile of toilet roll in the garage, which Mrs Jones had bought at the start of the pandemic for reasons which never became clear. In a rage, he sets light to it. The fire engines, ambulance, police, pathologist and coroner investigation cost north of £,. The nice man pays for Mr Jonesapos funeral. The house insurance had lapsed. The insurance company sells the land to a developer, who rebuilds the house. The insurance company and developer make £, in profit.Others do better. A neighbour with a good job begins working from home permanently, and has a better relationship with his children. The teacher next door gets a pay rise in post-pandemic gratitude to public servants, and someone  starts up a new local food delivery business. The area has an uplt in community spirit.But in other areas, thereaposs an uptick in crime. More burglaries, drug problems, street robberies. The police are stretched because thereaposs more domestic abuse, too. The prisons get full. Families get broken. Shoplting is re. There are millions of unemployed.Taxes rise to pay for all the new doctors and nurses, the public pay rises, and the bailouts that were given to businesses. The welfare net stitched together so hurriedly because of coronavirus begins to fray, and lots of people drop through it. This costs us more than helping them.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma announced a relaxation of the rules governing annual leave this morning. Most workers are entitled to  daysapos holiday including bank holidays every year, most of which cannot be carried between leave years, meaning they lose their holidaythey do not take it. Employers also face financial penaltiesthey do not ensure their workers take their statutory entitlement in any one year. Regulations announced on Friday will allow up to four weeks of unused leave to be carried into the next two leave years. The Government said the changes will ensure all employers affected by Covid- have the flexibility to allow workers to carry over leave at a time when granting it could leave them short-staffed in some of Britainaposs key industries, such as food and healthcare.  Mr Sharma said: Whether it is in our hospitals, or our supermarkets, people are working around the clock to help our country deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Todayaposs changes will mean these valued employees do not lose out on the annual leave they are entitled to as a result of their efforts, and employers are not penalised. Environment Secretary George Eustice said: From our fields to our supermarkets, we are hugely grateful to the many people working around the clock to keep the nation fed. At this crucial time, relaxing laws on statutory leave will help ensure key workers can continue the important work to keep supplies flowing, but without losing the crucial time off they are entitled to.

Have you been affected by the coronavirus  Email webnews@trinitymirror   Regional mortuaries may close to free up staff to work at the airport facility. The West Midlands has emerged as a hotspot for people testing positive for the coronavirus. Latest official data recording deaths of those who had contracted Covid- showed that  of the  people who died in the most recent period - % - had come from the region. Sandwell politan Borough Council has been co-ordinating scoping, on behalf of all West Midlands and Warwickshire local authorities, to find possible sites for temporary mortuary space. Other sites, including one in Rugby, Warwickshire, and the NEC itself, had been suggested as possible locations, before the option to use the airport site became available. The sprawling airport site includes a vast cargo hub, with several large hangers on the opposite side of the airstrip from its two main passenger terminals. The Government is making £. billion available to councils to deal with pressures on existing services from responding to coronavirus.  The plans are being co-ordinated on behalf of councils in Wolverhampton, Dudley, Walsall, Sandwell, Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull and across Warwickshire. Deputy leader of Sandwell Council Wasim Ali said: In reality, we have to prepare for the worst as local councils. Weaposve seen the numbers of deaths just keep rising. If it does get to that point, we have to be prepared. Itaposs a big logistics operation, so we have to take that decision to start the planning. He added: We really donapost want to have to use it, butwe do, then itaposll be available.  Mr Ali said a plan is needed because municipal mortuaries could run out of space. The back-up mortuary would also give grieving families a breathing space to make funeral arrangements,the system is placed under great strain, delaying how many burials can take place. He said staff at the hospital - and where in the health service - are working incredibly hard and need the public to help by staying at home, cutting non-essential journeys and following self-isolation rules. Mr Ali added: The clapping yesterday was phenomenal - people are coming together and understanding how important the NHS is.

I just feel permanently sore, nauseous and knackered, a bit like the months after I became a dad again at , and thought I’d turned into an extra in a zombie film.My we’s in the same land of the living dead, so we’ve been taking it in turns at night to self-isolate on the couch in case the other person’s coughing, sweating or wheezing tempts us to self-smother. The best thing is you lose your sense of smell, so picking up dog mess is like gathering blossom petals, but the worst is you lose your taste, meaning opening a bottle of Rioja brings on the Jesus effect in reverse. It turns wine into water denying you the pleasure of drinking away the pain. Plenty of friends are going through the same ordeal making a mockery of the small number of cases alleged to be out there. Like us they can’t test, so don’t knowthey have Covid-, even though it’s odds-on they do. My we and I are lucky, as we’re both journalists who work from home, so we can still do our jobs and get paid. Some self-employed people with the symptoms are still turning up for contract work for fear of being sacked. Others, who live with vulnerable family members, have been toldthey want to self-isolate they won’t get paid.Which feeds into the narrative being set by some of those household name, self-made, business mavericks, whose initial response to the crisis showed they don’t give a toss about anything other than their place in the Sunday Times Rich List. You know these noble patriots: Sir Richard Branson, the tax exile worth around £billion, whose first reaction was to tell his Virgin Atlantic staff to take eight weeks’ unpaid leave, before demanding a £.bn government bailout. He has since put £million into his vast empire to keep it afloat. EasyJet owner Stelios Haji-Ioannou telling pilots and cabin crew to take two months’ unpaid leave while paying himself £m in idends. Tim Martin, who begged for his ­Wetherspoon pubs to stay open despite the threat of infection, then advised his , workers to get a job at Tesco. He’s since been embarrassed into a U-turn and is now taking advantage of the taxpayer-funded staff retention scheme.

Sir Patrick tweeted that he has experienced no symptoms and has therefore not been tested. Some scientists were critical of the fact the House of Commons has largely stayed open for business, enabling the virus to spread. Professor Susan Michie, director of the Centre for Behaviour Change at University College London, said: Whilst the PM was telling people to stay at home and keep at least two metres apart from each other, the House of Commons was open for business and face-to-face parliamentary activities were carrying on.  Given the transmission routes of touching contaminated surfaces and breathing in virus-laden droplets, it should not come as a surprise to hear that the PM and Health Secretary have tested positive for coronavirus.

Joanna Phillips, , and Jonathan Metcalf, , were due to tie the knot in Las Vegas last summer, but had to cancel the wedding after Joanna was diagnosed with cancer.They also had ringside seats to see Tyson Fury take on Deontay Wilder in Vegas the day after their wedding date.Joanna was diagnosed with breast cancer in March last year, and she went straight into chemotherapy and just a month later, in April, she had lost all of her hair. She said: It happened so close to the day, so we had to postpone the wedding and the stag and hen dos as well. We were absolutely gutted we had to miss that .

If you have a serious problem or an emergency, and the dentist does not feel that you can manage it yourself at home, you will be referred to a local urgent care dental system.

Research carried out by Oxford Universityaposs Evolutionary Ecology of Infectious Disease group suggests that Covid- may have reached the UK by mid-January at the latest. The scenario is one of the several the researchers presented as possible, and goes against previously understood death rates. In the non-peer reviewed study they suggest that the coronavirus, like many emerging infections, may have spread invisibly for a month before its effects became clear at the end of February. If the Oxford researchers are right, then as much as half of the countryaposs population may already have been infected. Many people have contactedto claim that they experienced symptoms linked to Covid- in the weeks following the New Year. Below are the eight symptoms that may suggest you have already been infected by the coronavirus. Get all the latest coronavirus updates in our LIVE blog  Eye infections New research has indicated that eye infection such as conjunctivitis may be a symptom of Covid-. The College of Optometrists said: It is recognised that any upper respiratory tract infection may result in viral conjunctivitis as a secondary complication, and this is also the case with Covid-. However, it is unlikely that a person would present with viral conjunctivitis secondary to Covid- without other symptoms of fever or a continuous cough as conjunctivitis seems to be a late feature where is has occurred. A dry cough  Perhaps the most recognisable of the Covid- symptoms, given how dferent it can sound compared to a typical cough. The cough is generally new for you - or dferentyou generally have a smokeraposs cough -and persistant. More often than not it will last for at least half a day. Mental fatigue    Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue. Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache. The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. A high temperature    Although numbers y for dferent people, a rise in body temperature generally counts as a fever once it reaches .C . You can tell you have a feveryou feel hot to the touch on yourchest or back. Itaposs dficult to catch your breath If your chest starts to feel tight or you cannot breath, you may have caught the coronavirus. Most young people or those without pre-existing health conditions are unlikely to experience this symptom. Dyspnea - the term for when someone has dficulty breathing - may be coupled with a tightness in the chest, rapid breathing and heart palpatations. Loss of sense of smell and taste    Over the weekend the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology warned that losing your sense of smell and taste may mean you have Covid-. The ear, nose and throat specialist recommended anyone with such symptoms self-isolate immediatley. It has been suggested that the phenomena may be caused by the coronavirus killing cells in the nose and throat. Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas, the Association said in a statement. We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus. Tummy ache    As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea. Physical fatigue    Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult.

He had been following government advice to self-isolate at home, but on Thursday he was found dead by his partner Rhiannon Elias, also , at their home in Penygroes, Wales.  Paramedics dressed in protective clothing took his body away. Ms Davies said: When I arrived at the hospital, they were all in their suits. “I couldn’t even touch him, I wasn’t allowed. “I wasn’t even allowed to see him for long because they suspected the virus, and they needed to put him back into bags. “He had a plastic bag over his face.” Ms Davies, a health care worker, said tests were due to be carried out to establishThomas - who had no prior medical problems - had Covid-. His mother said: He was fit, he was healthy, he was energetic, he never smoked.  “He had nothing wrong with him. It’s a shock. “We’re just all in zombie mode at the moment. “I’ve been told to keep isolating. We’ve all got to self isolate. It’s all so cruel.” Rhiannon has now been told she must isolate with her children, Dylan Elias-Davies, four, and newborn Morgan, for the next fortnight. They had been unable to see Thomasapos body after he died. Ms Davies added: Rhiannon is absolutely devastated. She is in a million pieces. Her heart has come apart.” Paying tribute to her son, Ms Davies described him as having a “heart of gold”, and said he was a “devoted dad” to his boys.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter.

Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody!

Veronica said: “After coming up with the idea, I created the page and I contacted a friend of mine as I know her sister is a local singer, so she agreed to come on board with this.“She’ll be presenting and singing herself and naturally we’ve enlisted a few other people too.“I don’t sing so will not be making any live appearances as I’m not one for public speaking.“Marie Western will be presenting and is really what you could refer to as the face of Lockdown Live Aberdeenshire.“She’s got a list of artists so far and we’re just awaiting some more.“Our aim is to do it like a gig, with time slots for each artist, not going on too late in the evening as we understand people are doing it in their own homes so have to take noise levels into consideration as we head into the evening for

one of the first health board’s in Scotland to be able to do the test using special machines.Up to  samples can now be tested in the city each day # though it is understood that many tests are not currently required.There are plans to increase testing capability in the coming weeks.NHS Grampian’s consultant and service clinical director for medical microbiology and virology, Noha EL Sakka said: “There is an essential need, in order to manage this outbreak, for having prompt diagnostic technology.“Prior to Monday we were sending samples to the reference lab and there is a high turnaround time and time is wasted on transportation.#That has all been cut-off.#It cuts down on work for the lab with packaging and also in terms of reporting results too.“That is why we tried to streamline things

microbiology and virology network manager, added: “When the covid- outbreak first emerged in Scotland and the UK, Glasgow and Edinburgh started testing for the whole of Scotland.“NHS Grampian is one of the first health boards to go live with its own testing.“It’s great news we’re able to do this but there has been a lot of work.”Dr El Sakka added: “The massive benefit of this is it cuts out a huge time lag and is easing pressure on our colleagues at the reference lab.#We get results locally and faster and this is even more important with patients who require critical care.“We have changed sht patterns to extend the coverage so we can report results late into the evening and that helps with patient flow and that helps move pressure away from our frontline care teams.”Dr El Sakka said scientists from the north-east had travelled to the reference lab to witness the process that was being undertaken before beginning work to launch a service in the north-east.She added: “In order for the lab to introduce the test we had to show that our lab, our staff and the skills we have were capable of producing an accurate result.“We demonstrated that our samples were accurate.#Then Health Protection Scotland was happy for us to start testing on our own form that point onwards.”Dr El Sakka praised the ability and dedication of her colleagues to get the testing up and running swtly in the north-east.She said: “It’s a huge tribute to the dedication and skill of the team we have here in Grampian that we have got to this place so quickly.#I’m so proud of the staff and the dedication they have and their commitment.”Dr MacKenzie, who is a clinical scientist at ARI, added: “In Aberdeen, at NHS Grampian, we have a particularly good skill mix, we have very highly specialised

Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch. And the change in atmosphere was so marked that I genuinely wonderedmy trousers had somehow dropped to my ankles without my noticing.Thankfully, my clothes had remained bound to my body, but any faith I might have had in the ghost-hunting process was sliding away fast.As the tour continued, taking in several other locations promising ldquohigh activity, it became increasingly dficult to muster the energy to stay alert, with the clock ticking into the wee small hours.That said, there was one incident which aroused a certain degree of puzzlement - a maglite which appeared to flash when certain questions were posed.Admittedly, that was a curious development. But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread.

Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility. But the government does say people who are self-isolating can keep windows open to get fresh air.Whatrsquos social distancing The government is advising everyone who is not currently self-isolating to still practise social distancing.This means not meeting with friends and family, staying away from crowded areas, avoiding all non-essential travel, and working from home where possible.Luckily for these people, there is no restriction on going for walks outside. The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

So far, so Bonfire of the Vanities. The teen starts to work her way into the older womanrsquos le and, long story short, offers to be a surrogate infor pound,.Dan thinks this is a crazy idea, not to mention illegal. As does his sister, his lawyer, Emilyrsquos colleague, and probably every viewer watching. Many a drama would struggle to get beyond such a point, but the writer here is Nicole Taylor , who carefully takes each objection and picks away at it.: Susan Swarbrick meets Martin CompstonUltimately, the viewer has to believe that Emily is unhinged by grief, and that Dan would give in because he is desperate to keep her. Madness happens when people convince themselves a situation is all or nothing, black or white. That is how noir works.Even so, Taylorrsquos story is such a high-wire act that it needs to keep propelling itself onwards at speed or it will crash to the ground in a heap of improbabilities.Helping immensely with the task of keeping the viewer on side is a terric cast. Rundle is a convincing mix of fierce determination and eggshell fragility. Mack, a real find, does that bravest of things as an actor and makes herself an unlikeable pain in the neck.Then there is Compston. Once the prince of Sunday nights as Essex wide boy DS Arnott in Line of Duty, he is even better back on his home turf and in his own accent.It was a nice touch by Taylor to make Dan a bad boy made good, eventhe working class middle class contrast was laid on a a bit thick.

If this were the era of switchboards, operators could tap into millions of lines and hear the increasingly anxious voices of the middle-aged trying to get their stubborn and defensive old ones to see sense.The problem is, the over-seventies are exceptionally proud of retaining their independence.

Thatrsquos true, but itrsquos not the point. Thatrsquos not what culture is for. Culture isnrsquot there just to keep you distracted. Culture is also meant to reflect the world wersquore living in, to express the human spirit right here and right now. When culture stops, that canrsquot happen.

And once catastrophes end, culture blooms like a parched garden after rain. The aftermath of the First World War and the Spanish Flu saw modernism flourish, jazz take over the world, the triumph of cinema. After , there was Rock and Roll, and Angry Young Men.

In , he won pound, in the final of Scottish EDGE ndash the competition aimed at identying and supporting Scotlandrsquos up-and-coming, high-growth potential entrepreneurial talent.From its early roots in Glasgow -with the first two intakes creating  new businesses with an annualised combined turnover of over pound, just four months after the programmersquos launch- Orbit has established ldquochapters in major cities across the UK, including Edinburgh, Birmingham, London and Manchester.Kieran Aitken dropped out of university to focus on building his own business empireOrbit has decentralised its structure and now entrepreneurs based overseas can apply for a licence to run the programme. The organisation, meanwhile, has plans to open chapters in Australia, Canada and the USA by .The incubator programme is a powerful one, suggests Aitken. ldquoWe cover everything that you need to help you be successful in business, he explains.ldquoFrom generating ideas, all the financial and legal stuff like tax and accounts to raising finance and sales and marketing ndash itrsquos very, very comprehensive.ldquoWe provide mentoring and access to leading business figures, advice on how to scale up and grow a business, how to build and lead your team ndash everything that will help create the winning mindset and knowledge required to run a successful business.That said, no amount of teaching, coaching and mentoring can prepare a young person for the hard work and determination required in setting up and running a business. ldquoI think some people have that entrepreneurial gene, says Aitken, who launched his first business at the age of .ldquoFrom quite a young age I wanted to make money and at school I was selling lsquoanything legalrsquo in the playground, he continues. ldquoI was never very academic at school but was an avid reader of business books and started a car and van detailing company with just pound. By the time I was  it was generating a healthy five-figure net profit annually.All the same, the Renfrewshire schoolboy went on to study business at the University of Strathclyde.ldquoIt wasnrsquot a case of not enjoying university, but I was still running my business and not devoting enough time to study so I dropped out in third year, he says. ldquoContinuing wouldnrsquot have been fair on my tutors or myself.Today, he explains, many of his ldquoOrbiteers have the same outlook in that they donrsquot necessarily feel that further education is the best career option for them.ldquoA lot of young people donrsquot know what they want to do, but go to university without any clear goals, says Aitken.ldquoSchool just doesnrsquot work for everyone andthere are problems at home or other issues then that can impact on their studies ndash and for others, the prospect of another three or four years of studying after leaving school isnrsquot attractive.ldquoA good brain and personal drive ndash and the determination to make your own path in le ndash can be worth much more than a degree, he says.ldquoFrom coffee shops to online magazines, wersquove helped young people with bright ideas in many dferent business sectors launch their own companies with some achieving a five-figure income before their th birthday.But Aitkenrsquos message to all young people starting out in business is to ldquonot get carried away too soon.ldquoI moved too quickly on a flawed revenue model and didnrsquot plan very well, he admits. ldquoWe bounced back and are much more careful now and take advice, but it taught me that you canrsquot run a business without making mistakes.ldquoWhen you do make a mistake, donrsquot give up ndash pick yourself back up, get on with it and yoursquoll come back stronger.Orbitrsquos three-month incubator programme, believes Aitken, is the ldquoultimate training experience for the entrepreneurs of tomorrow.To date,  new businesses have been created with Orbitrsquos support and on average there are  applications for every space available on the programme.In addition to running Orbit Enterprise Education as a social enterprise, Kieran Aitken operates DripDrab, a tech business he launched last year that provides card payment processing to tradespeople and allows households across the UK to book a window cleaner at the click of a button.The business is growing at pace and there are plans to expand the  to incorporate additional services such as plumbing and dog walking.Find out more at www.orbit-incubator and www.dripdrab"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11201286.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-artist-colours-blues-away-social-isolation","story":"OVER the coming weeks, we are all likely to struggle with the boredom of being stuck at home.Butyou find yourself twiddling your thumbs ndash or climbing the walls - then adult colouring could be the answer.No longer just a pastime of kids trying to stay between the lines, intricate grown-up colouring books have been proven to reduce stress and anxiety, improve motor skills and even aid sleep.In our current hyper-anxious world, adult colouring appears like the perfect solution.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.You said earlier in this thread: #We have much ignorance and  information in the media.# I suggest you focus on getting your facts right before you start bashingor the press at large. Unless of course you have abandoned the truth and decided to take the path of the most habitual of liars Donald Trump  In which case I#d have more success debating this issuewith a brick!Now stop panicking and do like me. I have volunteered to come out of retirement and rejoin the NHS. I am qualied to help and will do so without questionI can. Now just stop your moaning, spreading of alarmist criticism and postulating about something you know little. Nothing is much worse than raising fear and alarm when one is not remotely qualied so to do.Ian T # I#d advise you to crawl out of your own behind, but you appear so far up it any effort to to do so would likely be futile. I#ll leave it for others to read this discussion and decide who knows what between us.With the government shutting down Parliament, and effective scrutiny of its actions, yesterdaythere is no prospect of outside pressure changing their course at the moment. Everybody#s time, is therefore, best spent dealing with the practicalities of the situation we face for now.Your offer to come out of retirement to help the health service is commendable and I wish you all the best with that. It was inspirational to see over half a million people sign up yesterday to volunteer with the NHS.I remain sceptical about the path our government is on with this coronavirus but the likes of these NHS volunteers give me hope. I urge everybody to follow their lead and do whatever they can to look after themselves, those around them and other people in general during these challenging times.Good to see your motivations are political rather like the newspaper you keep quoting from. If you believe what you babble on about Parliament Shutting down rational argument is pointless. Try not to be too frightened and really understand a little science and use some common sense.For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  . Unlike Shetland they are almost certainly testing for Covid- more widely in the community, so it is not possible to directly compare our current figure of  hospital tested cases to their .Whoops, no. I gave the population of Faro!! Portugal!!! Dyslexia rules OK!!!!Just to state the obvious. If you are afraid for yourself,relatives and loved ones. All you have to do is stay inside your house. It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin. Retrieve mail only every two to three days to minimize exposure.As to groceries, avoid fresh produce.Wear disposable gloves when shopping.Only buy canned or frozen items and sanitize them before putting into storage.Ideally, buy enough that you can rotate the stock.Use only grocery items, canned or frozen that have been in your possession for  days or more.On the other handyou literally stay in your house and not opened the door to anyone or thing, for the next month or two, or three, or four# the virus probably will not be able to get to you.

It’s like you feel part of the French Resistance # you’ve got to keep on doing what you do.“It was ambiguous, where they were saying ‘ you can’t work from home you need to go to work,’ but the goalposts changed quite rapidly.“We can’t be seen to just be carrying on because that’s quite a selfish thing to do.“From my point of view it would definitely be wrong for me to sneak around and think I could work..”He said he believed he could get by until June.“We have other income, Myra’s working. It’s not disastrous for us. When this is all blown over I’ve still got a job to go to.”Mr Carmichael welcomed the announcement, but indicated they could have gone further.“MPs of all parties have been highlighting the lack of support for self-employed people for some days and I am glad that the government is starting to catch up,” he said.“As I put it to the Prime Minister on Wednesday, self-employed people are not looking for special treatment but for equal treatment with employed people. The measures today seem to go some way towards that.“There are, however, still large gaps in the support for self-employed people. The wait until June will be extremely challenging for many, especially with the reluctance of many banks to offer bridging loans currently.“Tourism, which makes up such a vital part of the local economy in the isles, is obviously highly seasonal and yet this is not recognised in the Chancellor’s plan.“Three months of government support based on an ‘annual average’ will not paper over the financial hole faced by those who rely on the usual summer trade to cover them through the rest of the year.” raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"wilma named as shetland wool week patron ","story":"This years Shetland Wool Week patron Wilma Malcolmson.The Shetland Wool Week patron for this year was named today as knitwear designer Wilma Malcolmson, who is internationally renowned for her skilfully blended Fair Isle knitwear.The much-anticipated annual hat pattern, which is now synonymous with the launch of the patron, has also been released. This year’s official hat, designed by her, is called #Katie’s Kep#.The wool week organisers said they were delighted to have Mrs Malcolmson as this year’s patron. She was a key player in the local knitting community, a wool week and Shetland Peerie Makker tutor, and also one of Shetland’s most influential and innovative designers.She has lived in Shetland all her le and, like many others who grew up in the isles, has knitted from childhood. Originally from Garderhouse on the West Side, she later moved to Cunningsburgh where she lived with her late husband Leonard.She established her business, Shetland Designer, in  and during that time she has seen her creations reach all four corners of the world.Mrs Malcolmson said: “I am touched and honoured to be this year’s patron. Wool week is a wonderful event that helps to bring people, not just knitters, from all around the world together.#To me, the festival represents a time of friendship, of learning from each other and an appreciation of our islands and way of le as it celebrates old and new by putting traditional patterns and techniques on equal terms with new, innovative ones.#The hat is the common bond for us all and I am delighted to have been asked to design it and become part of the wool week story.“My hat ‘Katie’s Kep’ is named after my mother Katie. It includes the patterns that she taught me when I was a peerie lass because they were her favourites. She belonged to that large group of professional knitters, without whom our Shetland colour work and lace heritage might not have been as alive and vibrant as it is today. This is my tribute to all the known and unknown designer artists of Shetland throughout the centuries.”On her love of knitting, Mrs Malcolmson said: “My mother instilled in me an interest in patterns and colours, from her I learned the importance of contrast and ‘blending’. Colour inspiration is all around us in Shetland – you only need to look at the rugged landscape, seashores the ever-changing skies to find shades that work together.”She has created four very dferent colourways for the hat using yarn from Jamieson’s of Shetland, Jamieson and Smith, Uradale Yarns and Shetland Handspun.Each company has prepared yarn kits and are available to take back orders online, but are currently unable to guarantee specic delivery dates. Customers are urged to keep an eye on the respective websites for updates.The organisers said: “We are always thrilled to announce the new patron and hat, and perhaps even more so this year. Throughout this ongoing global crisis we have received many requests urging us to release the hat pattern and we are pleased to be able to make it available, as always, as a free download from our Shetland Wool Week website.#We hope it will bring some welcome light relief and focus as well as a sense of connection for all our supporters.”#Katie#s Kep# – this year#s official wool week hat.Mrs Malcolmson added: #I really do feel that this is in the interest of knitters. Under these strange times we are living in there are so many knitters around the world taking comfort from their work and enjoying their knitting when they are self-isolating.#Knitting has been so important to Shetland all through the years. When I grew up the knitters around me were knitting to help the economy, to put food on the table. It wasn#t a hobby at that time.#The th Shetland Wool Week is due to run from th September and already a huge amount of effort has gone into preparing for the event. However, in light of the coronavirus pandemic, the event remains under review.• An extensive question and answer interview with Mrs Malcolmson is available to read via the Shetland Wool Week newsletter and website. A special Facebook SWWKALhas also been launched for Katie’s Kep and the organisers are encouraging everyone to join in and share their hat works in progress, questions and photos. raquo.."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/001WH0603NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 6th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week service users at Tigh na Drochaid Resource Centre in Portree produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

More centres will open in the coming days, with at least one Covid- centre in each Trust area.Minister Swann said: “Primary Care Covid- Centres are an essential part of the fight against this virus. To ensure vital GP services can be maintained throughout the coming weeks and months, it is absolutely critical that those who show symptoms are separated from the patients with non Covid- related conditions. “Covid- centres are not testing facilities and are only for patients who are very unwell, are suspected of having Covid- and require medical attention. Patients will not be able to report directly to these centres without being referred by their GP or Out of Hours provider.“Whilst the centres will help to free up GP services to deal with the Covid- pandemic, it is vital we balance this with the need for primary care services to continue with the minimum of disruption.”Patients attending these centres will receive appropriate treatment, assessment and,necessary, onward referral to hospital.Dr Tom Black, Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, is among the GPs working at the new Primary Care Covid- Centre at Altnagelvin. He said: “GPs have organised themselves very quickly and there has been a huge amount of work done between the Department of Health, the Health and Social Care Board, Trusts and GP Federations to provide the community with these Covid- centres.“This method of GPs working in the middle ground is vital to protect hospital services for patients with the greatest need. I have no doubt that this work will save lives.”Concluding, the Health Minister said: “I want to pay tribute to the vision, rapid action and commitment shown by our primary care doctors. Without hesitation, they have risen to meet this unprecedented challenge. On behalf of everyone in our community I want to thank them for the hugely important work they are doing.“We must all now do our part to support these healthcare professionals in the fight to stop the spread of this virus.

They thought the embassy might be able to get them shelter or repatriated back home.They came out with leaflets with phone numbers which we#ve all been trying to ring for days but are just left on hold for hours and hours. The Irish Embassy itself was actually closed and there was no one to speak to. Lots of people here have no family support.We don#t know how long this is going to last so they#re all living day by day, not eating or drinking.I#m really worried about the people here, especially the mental health of young people.Dr McGourty does have a flight booked home for this weekend, but this isn#t an option for many travellers who are saving their money.I#m not worried about myself, he said. If anything happened to my family and I can#t be there for them, that would be the worst thing possible.Sinn Fein#s West Belfast MP Paul Maskey has added to the calls for both governments to repatriate citizens.With increased flight restrictions and flight cancellations, citizens are finding it increasingly dficult tohome, he said.Mr Maskey said he welcomed new guidelines from the Republic#s government which helped  peoplehome to Dublin yesterday, including around  doctors. These guidelines include the establishment of a register that will be used to advise Irish citizens ing home and alternative flight arrangements, he said.I would encourage citizens to both read and follow these guidelines. But both the Irish and British governments must do much more and take a more proactive approach to assisting citizens. This is a time of great fear and anxiety for families as Covid- continues to spread, the additional burden of being stranded abroad should not be placed on them.In Peru, hundreds of people have said they fear being stuck for months after two reported cases of Covid- in a hostel saw  tourists placed into quarantine. Many say they face a race against time as hostels are due to close by the end of March.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the first Government-charted flight from Peru arrived back in the UK yesterday.He added he was working urgently with Peruvian authorities to deliver more flights.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This should be done alone, unless it is with members of your household.If you provide care or help to a vulnerable person you will also be able to leave home for this purpose.If you are a “key worker”, such as a police officer or nurse, and your child children are attending school, you will be able to dropped them off and pick them up.Q. The UK Government says I must only travel to and from work“absolutely necessary” - how do I knowit is “absolutely necessary” A. All those who are able to work from home have been advised to do so, however for many jobs this is not possible. Those providing essential services or goods will still be able to travel to and from work. Social distancing rules, however, should still be enforced. This means you should stay at least two metres apart from anyone and work gatherings should not take place.Q. Will the children of orced parents be able to visit both of them A. Cabinet minister the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has confirmed that children under  can move between the households of separated parents, as long as this is normal practice.Q.

All social gatherings of more than two people are prohibited.Q. What businesses are allowed to remain open A. Only businesses providing essential goods or services are permitted to stay open. In the food and drink industry, this includes restaurants operating takeaway or delivery services and canteens at hospitals, care homes, schools and prisons.Facilities offering food or drink to the homeless are also permitted.All retail shops should shut, except for supermarkets and other food shops, pharmacies, petrol stations, hardware shops and laundrettes.Pet shops, newsagents and banks can also remain open.Here#s the full list of essential retail services which should continue to trade in Northern Ireland:Supermarkets , convenience stores and corner shopsGrocery markets – not including farmers markets, hot food markets or street food marketsLocal fresh food suppliers like butchers, fishmongers and bakeriesHot food takeaways - over the counter services only and not allowing an option to eat inPharmacies Chemists and Health food shopsDental surgeries, opticians, audiology, physiotherapy, chiropody and other professional vocational medical services – for urgent appointments onlyVeterinary clinics and pet shopsNewsagentsHardware and building supplies storesRetail services in hospitalsPetrol stations, garages, and auto repair shops for urgent work onlyHigh street banks, credit unions and cash pointsPost officesFuneral directors, crematoriums and relatedLaundrettes and dry cleanersStorage and distribution facilities, including delivery drop-off pointsMedical or storage servicesPublic car parks in towns and cities near food takeaway servicesPublic toilets.Businesses that are permitted to stay open have been asked to ensure a distance of two meters is kept between customers and shop assistants, to only let people enter in small groups, and to introduce queue control measures outside the premises.Hotels, hostels and BBs can only remain open for those guests staying while their primary residence is unavailable. Key workers can also continue to stay at such accommodation.Manufacturing and construction firms can continue to operate as long as they enforce social distancing.

How will these measures be enforced A. Police will have the power to disperse public gatherings and issue fines, however it is unclear how officers will monitor whether people are breaking the rules, what action will then be taken, and how much the fines will be.Environmental Health and Trading Standards officers will enforce the rules regarding businesses. Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.Q. How long will the restrictions be in place for A. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks. It is right we review what are quite draconian measures.

It kicked off that morning, when an acquaintance texted into a WhatsApp group I am in, one with about  members. It was one of those messages we were all plagued by for the first few days of this thing, before peoplecopped themselves on.  This one was from an anonymous doctor , urging people to take ious measures. Most of it was about children. The vectors. Towards the end it got to the grandparents and how they could not be expected to babysit. There followed some discussion in the group over how important this was. Hence my rage. I am a self-employed single mother, supporting my child, and a home, I ranted to the ious friends I rang to talk me out of texting into the group itself, something I knew I would ultimately regret. My parents do not babysit. What they do is so much more. They are helping us to rear our daughter. They mind her to an extent that allows me to earn a living. If I was paying an actual childminder, working probably wouldn#t be worth my while financially. More than that, though: while her father and I co-parent amicably, co-parenting is entirely dferent to having a spouse. You don#t sit on the couch after bedtime with a co-parent and confide your small anxieties over your child#s welfare. Neither do you go to Ikea or the DIY store together of a Saturday because your child needs a new bed or something in your house needs fixing.I do these things with my parents - my daughter#s grandparents.I#m lucky. I#m so supported that sometimes I feel like a fraud calling myself a single parent. In any given week, my parents will be involved in school drop-offs and collections, in bringing my five-year-old to after-school activities hosting playdates, cooking meals, tracking down suddenly needed new sizes of clothing, and doing bedtime. They live five minutes away my daughter sees them almost every day. Three years ago, my parents got me through my separation, and made it okay to be a single parent, because I never really felt like one, so supported was I. What going through a orce taught me was that you can lose the person you had built a le with, without whom le seemed unimaginable, but that there are still some people in your le who are givens. What the last week has so shockingly revealed is that sometimes the decision to be there, in your le supporting you, might be out of their hands. Suddenly, we were facing into weeks, maybe months, of isolation from them. My father has asthma, so I knew immediately, before the WhatsApp groups cranked into action, that we would need to isolate from them. I was raging, because I was so scared. Everyone going through this has their own particular challenges. I work from home already, so that hasn#t been too much of an adjustment. So far, unlike many of my fellow freelance friends who have, terryingly, seen months of work disappear overnight, I#m busy.But it#s a strange kind of isolation to face into this as the only adult in your house. And the worries we are all facing can feel that bit more intense: finance, isolation, working from home when the children are there. Some single parents will face isolation from their children, for who knows how long. The first few days were fine. I realised quite quickly that I had to be strict with myself. Monitor exactly what I was consuming. In ways, it was freeing: muting WhatsApp groups which threw up links to doom and gloom not getting back to anything but the absolutely essential stuff. When my marriage ended I learned that for a time, when you#re in the midst of huge change and lots of grief, you need to make your world really small. You go off social media at times when you are mentally vulnerable you take things day by day, hour by houryou need. Having a child to focus on gives you a purpose, takes you out of your own mind and the potential vortex of anxiety that awaits there, threatening to pull you under. As the days went on in this past week, I noticed mental buoyancy becoming harder. I didn#t suffer the vicious anxiety I saw paralysing a lot of my friends. More a heavy sadness, like the waves of grief. We#ve had to isolate from my daughter#s father we don#t know when he#ll next see her. The sight of her one night putting her little arms around the phone during their video call and saying cuddle  nearly broke me. Like lots of us, she#s having vivid dreams each night, which she recounts to me every morning. I dreamt granddad collected me for school, she says, and I have to hide my face in the press, pretending to be looking for something so she won#t see the tears in my eyes. I miss granddad, she says a few days in and gets upset. As kids do, five minutes later she appears to have moved on entirely. But I begin to notice an increase in mentions of physical complaints, a regular sore tummy. I find that the time I#m most bothered by the social isolation is when I least want to talk to other people. Friends call and I ignore them, or text saying bad day, won#t risk crying in front of her, speak tomorrow. We video-call my parents and I stay just out of sight of the camera so they can#t see me welling up. When my daughter sees my father she howls grrrraandaaaaad, and I can barely hold it together. The panic comes in waves: when my mother texts late at night to check in when my daughter goes silent and stares into the middle distance. Alright Beanie  I ask her. I miss Daddy, and everyone, she replies. I tell myself, you know how to do this - you#ve been through this before. When your marriage ends, all sense of the future you had imagined disappears and for a time instead the future becomes a scary place. Who knows what it will bring  But I know what that is. Future thinking. Worrying about things yet to come, which may never happen, things you cannot control. By worrying about the future, you risk overwhelming yourself in the present. Stay right here in this moment, I tell myself strictly. Tidy a room. Paint with your daughter. Give her a bath. It#s not all bad, though. As with everything, there is a flip-side. Obviously, adult conversation would be good. But there is something to be said for the company of a joyful five-year-old who isn#t consumed with anxiety. It can be helpful that the face you spend all day looking at isn#t tinged with panic. But then when you get consumed by fear, for her, for yourself, for your family, your work, there#s no one to bounce it off. Not having someone to carry the fear I have and being the only one to carry it for my son… another single mother confides. The nights are the worst. Throughout this first week, I#ve been making regular trips to the kitchen to cry, before heading back in to pretend all is fine.People are lovely. We have a WhatsApp dinner party with my best friend and her family, where the children eat pasta and shout at each other. My cousin and my aunt drop off book parcels for my daughter. I contact the Department of Health to enquire as to the safety of two single parents joining forces. It#s really a case of iniduals now weighing up all the pros and cons of doing something like this against the public health advice of good hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, social distancing, keeping surfaces clean etc. Is everyone currently well  Does anybody have underlying conditions  Has anyone been in contact with a suspected or confirmed case  Is there sufficient space in the house  Answers to these types of questions will help people judge whether the advantages outweigh the risk.It sounds like a yes. Frolo, the networking app for single parents, is facilitating virtual meet-ups, group messaging for members, and providing financial advice.The WhatsApping calms down, but I find I need to still be careful. All that posting of routines online. It#s helpful, I suppose, but dficultyour reality is trying to maintain a full-time career, with no one to take the parenting sht while you work. Do they think all mothers are at home, not working through this  asks one single mother with three children who have been sent home with huge amounts of school work. Mine is five, and I have made an executive decision that she will be fine, whatever amount we do or do not get done. But it#s dficult for single parents with older children. The TV goes on far more regularly than I would like, but I decide to quell the guilt. One morning, on deadline, I look up to realise that she is on her second viewing of her favourite movie that day. She#s figured out the remote. I#m practising an extreme form of #whatever works# parenting, I tell a friend. Suspend your normal rules and rituals around screen time, because you#ve got to do what you#ve got to do. These are not normal times. The normal rules and routines do not apply, Joanna Fortune, psychotherapist and author of  Minute Parenting, tells me.I think single parents are actually better equipped than most to deal with this, one single mother tells me. I for one am used to being trapped indoors when the milk runs out three kids under nine means I can#t leave the house. I am used to online shopping, managing alone. We are better at multi-tasking, better at handling considerable anxiety due to personal struggles. Better at doing everything with kids in tow. I don#t allow my brain to go to what- places.I know what she means. Sometimes, as I#m in the kitchen making yet another snack, a flash of the mind-bogglingly daunting nature of what lies ahead sweeps over me. It might be just the two of us, for months. It was my network that got me through the dficulty of the last few years, when my marriage fell apart and now we are cut off from them.But even though this feels incredibly dficult, and draining, I also know for a fact that there is no way I will go under. I#m exhausted, and frazzled, and crying on and off , but I know also that I am in no danger of succumbing to anxiety over this. I don#t worryabout what I cannot control. In short, I can manage my mind. That is because my friend is right. Single parents have developed a mental hardiness that at a time like now stands to us. A resilience. Another mother confides that she has been sick for the past week, she thinks it is the coronavirus, and she is solo parenting. Are you okay  I ask. She replies that she has parented alone through vomiting flu, so she can handle anything.If you have survived a long relationship falling apart, you#ve had to get on, in the face of it all going to pieces.

Detailed information about the process and timetable will follow once we have advised the Department of Education. This will include the steps we would like teachers to follow.We will outline, shortly after this, the process that we will follow to make sure grades are fair across schools and colleges, as well as any proposals for appeals.Further updates will continue to be available via www.ccea.org.ukBelfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland Army base to be used as large-scale mortuaryMale cyclist dies after being hit by car in MoiraCoronavirus: Sweeping overhaul on the way for hospitals as Northern Ireland prepares for huge surgeArds bride Kirsten moves big day forward and  guests watch online as they tie the knot during coronavirus pandemicCoronavirus: What measures are Northern Ireland councils taking in response to lockdown ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At least one climate-controlled building on Holywood#s Kinneagar site in Co Down will be converted for this purpose, the BBC reports.Health Minister Robin Swann has warned that deaths in Northern Ireland could surpass the , people killed in Northern Ireland during the Troubles.Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said on Wednesday he estimates that thousands of people in Northern Ireland are infected with Covid-.

Authorities are seeking to expand capacity for storage of bodies in Northern Ireland amid concerns the funeral system will be overwhelmed.Officials are working to increase the current capacity of  bodies due to fears of a backlog of burials and cremations.Justice Minister Naomi Long said the priority was to ensure there was respect and dignity for the deceased and their families.We are on a fast moving and frankly troubling terrain, and we have to plan accordingly, both in inidual departments and across the Executive, she said.Preparing for the future and looking at worst case scenarios, while trying to mitigate against those worst case scenarios, is now our focus.As part of that work, we are taking precautions to prepare for the risk that the normal burial arrangements are not sufficient.We will do all we can to ensure dignity for the deceased and their family. We will work with all of those involved to enable as many people as possible to be buried or cremated in the usual way.However, we must also safeguard public health. In the event that the virus hits Northern Ireland very hard, then we have seen where in the world that this gives rise to challenges which we are working to meet.We currently have some additional space in temporary resting places for the deceased over and above the normal arrangements. We are actively seeking to increase that capacity and are working closely with a range of organisations to find the best solution.As part of that work, a request has been submitted for the use of the soon to be decommissioned Kinnegar site near Belfast to be used as the NI Temporary Resting Place, in the event that it is needed.Earlier in the week, DoJ officials told a Stormont committee there was likely to come a point where it would be impossible to adhere to the current practice of holding funerals within three days of a death.As well as an increase in death rate due to the disease, sickness among funeral directors and council staff is anticipated to put added pressure on the system.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadCoronavirus: Northern Ireland Army base to be used as large-scale mortuaryMale cyclist dies after being hit by car in MoiraCoronavirus: Sweeping overhaul on the way for hospitals as Northern Ireland prepares for huge surgeArds bride Kirsten moves big day forward and  guests watch online as they tie the knot during coronavirus pandemicCoronavirus: What measures are Northern Ireland councils taking in response to lockdown ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Sunak said the help, worth up to a maximum of £, a month, would cover % of people who work for themselves. However, the scheme will not come into place until June, with self-employed workers advised to apply for Universal Credit in the meantime.The package was announced after the Government was criticised for initially supporting only company employees. Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce president Ian Henry said: “ offers a leline to the vast majority of self-employed people, many of whom have seen their livelihoods vanish overnight.“I have heard from many sole traders and self-employed people throughout this week. “The Northern Ireland Chamber, along with other business groups, has worked constructively with the Government to ensure the self-employed receive similar support to those who are employed through PAYE.“We welcome the scale of this scheme and recognise the complexities involved in its design. “It is now critical that the Government delivers this practical support as soon as possible.”Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Finance Minister Conor Murphy also welcomed the package.Mrs Dodds said: “This is a much-needed measure which we have been asking for on behalf tens of thousands of people in Northern Ireland.”Mr Murphy added: “While this announcement is welcome, it is concerning that the workers won’t receive this until June.”The support was also welcomed by the Federation of Small Businesses . Spokesman Roger Pollen said the announcement would “give hope to many hard-working, self-employed entrepreneurs”.“Over the last number of weeks, self-employed people have seen support introduced for employee incomes and grants for some businesses but have felt left behind as they have seen their own incomes dry up,” Mr Pollen added.“It is therefore welcome that the Chancellor has brought forward a package for self-employed people. “The FSB has been at the sharp end of negotiations with the Government in recent days, arguing for this package to be as generous as possible.“While what has been announced is not perfect and will not deliver for everyone, it does provide income for our most hard-pressed self-employed — taxi drivers, hairdressers, plumbers, electricians and many more — who will have seen their work disappear as people socially distance. This is an incredibly challenging situation for everyone. While the healthcare response is paramount overcoming the economic disruption also requires a rapid response in the interests of jobs and of future growth.“It is important that the scheme is ready on time and delivered as soon as possible. “As this will be delivered through the self-assessment system, it is vital that any late filers submit their  right now, or they could risk missing out.”Mr Sunak said the Government would pay self-employed people a taxable grant worth % of their average monthly profits over the last three years, up to £, a month.However, people recently made self-employed will not be included in the scheme and must look for welfare support. Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said: “The UK Government has been clear that we will stand side-by-side with the Northern Ireland Executive in doing whatever it takes to help iniduals and businesses through the coronavirus crisis.”Belfast Related ContentNewsCase Study : #Around % of the business has more or less just gone because the gym is closed# Matthew McMahon runs a personal training business, Inside Strength, in Craigavon, Co Armagh.

You have that dark humour.In the book Joanne talks about her pregnancy with Hannah, which was fraught with dficulty as doctors thought she may miscarry again, due to an incompetent cervix.Terriedof losing her baby, she was put in six months of bed rest during the winter of .Their beautul daughter Hannah was eventually born safe and well, following a caesarean section.I had to have a section because she was breach from  weeks, recalls Joanne.The consultant told me thats what saved her from going the same way as Jacob.They said she was standing up in my womb holding on to my ribs.Joanne got pregnant again but the pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially le-threatening complication where the baby grows outside the womb.The baby couldnt survive and the couple were told there was no option but to end the pregnancy.The operation didnt go to plan and Joanne had to have one of her fallopiantubes removed and two blood transfusions.After I came back from surgery I was in recovery for hours and when my mammy saw me she got very emotional.She said I know you want to give Hannah a sibling but you are my child and Hannah needs her motherI said right Lawrence, Im not trying any more. We have to draw a line under it.It killed me.I could still have another baby, but I know mentally that I couldnt cope.Throughout her pregnancies Joanne had been keeping diaries of everything that happened.Ive always written, she says. Even before this book I always joked that I was nursing until I decided what to write about.I wrote a diary after Jacob and I still have it. I suppose its like the mood diaries we use in work so people can see they are getting better.I made a diary of my pregnancy with Hannah and then after she was born I was content and I thought this is great, Im finally a mammy.I loved being in that mammy role and all the funny stuff that happened and I decided I really should keep a diary of all this.Joanne sent her diary to friends who were living in America and Australia as a way of keeping in touch and gradually built up the confidence to show some work colleagues too.One girl at work has a sister who is a blogger The Red Duchess, and she told me I should share it as a blog.I had it all on my computer to show Hannah when she is older anyway so I did it and I thought sure this is lovely.It wasnt until she was forced to take three months off work after breaking her shoulder that Joanne started thinking about turning the blog into a book.She contacted local authors Claire Allan and Felicity McCall for advice and they gave her the confidence to approach a number of publishers.Despite receiving positive feedback, Joanne found the process a bit overwhelmingand decided to shelve the plans for a book to concentrate on her career.Around this time a promotion came up at work and Lawrence encouraged her to go for it.I thought it would be a wee challenge but I was sick nearly every day when I was studying for the interview, she admits.Doubts would pop into my head like well, you were s*** at pregnancy and stuff.I did the interview and it was horrendous. Afterwards I cried so much and I knew it wasnt right.I was always grand at interviews and I never let it get to me. But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

You have that dark humour.In the book Joanne talks about her pregnancy with Hannah, which was fraught with dficulty as doctors thought she may miscarry again, due to an incompetent cervix.Terriedof losing her baby, she was put in six months of bed rest during the winter of .Their beautul daughter Hannah was eventually born safe and well, following a caesarean section.I had to have a section because she was breach from  weeks, recalls Joanne.The consultant told me thats what saved her from going the same way as Jacob.They said she was standing up in my womb holding on to my ribs.Joanne got pregnant again but the pregnancy was ectopic, a potentially le-threatening complication where the baby grows outside the womb.The baby couldnt survive and the couple were told there was no option but to end the pregnancy.The operation didnt go to plan and Joanne had to have one of her fallopiantubes removed and two blood transfusions.After I came back from surgery I was in recovery for hours and when my mammy saw me she got very emotional.She said I know you want to give Hannah a sibling but you are my child and Hannah needs her motherI said right Lawrence, Im not trying any more. We have to draw a line under it.It killed me.I could still have another baby, but I know mentally that I couldnt cope.Throughout her pregnancies Joanne had been keeping diaries of everything that happened.Ive always written, she says. Even before this book I always joked that I was nursing until I decided what to write about.I wrote a diary after Jacob and I still have it. I suppose its like the mood diaries we use in work so people can see they are getting better.I made a diary of my pregnancy with Hannah and then after she was born I was content and I thought this is great, Im finally a mammy.I loved being in that mammy role and all the funny stuff that happened and I decided I really should keep a diary of all this.Joanne sent her diary to friends who were living in America and Australia as a way of keeping in touch and gradually built up the confidence to show some work colleagues too.One girl at work has a sister who is a blogger The Red Duchess, and she told me I should share it as a blog.I had it all on my computer to show Hannah when she is older anyway so I did it and I thought sure this is lovely.It wasnt until she was forced to take three months off work after breaking her shoulder that Joanne started thinking about turning the blog into a book.She contacted local authors Claire Allan and Felicity McCall for advice and they gave her the confidence to approach a number of publishers.Despite receiving positive feedback, Joanne found the process a bit overwhelmingand decided to shelve the plans for a book to concentrate on her career.Around this time a promotion came up at work and Lawrence encouraged her to go for it.I thought it would be a wee challenge but I was sick nearly every day when I was studying for the interview, she admits.Doubts would pop into my head like well, you were s*** at pregnancy and stuff.I did the interview and it was horrendous. Afterwards I cried so much and I knew it wasnt right.I was always grand at interviews and I never let it get to me. But I was just so low and couldnt get past it.The post came up again and I thoughtI went to the doctors and got something to settle me for the interview I might have a chance.When I went to GP surgery there must have a pregnancy clinic going on and there were pregnant woman everywhere and I felt so emotional.Joanne was seen by a young doctor and explained why she was there, but after reading her notes and listening to her story the doctor told her she didnt think the job interview was the problem.She said Youve had  years of trauma trying to get pregnantShe said Joanne, youre a nurse - youve just bottled this up and done most of this yourself and this interviewhas just tipped you over the edge.Joanne got treatment for her anxiety and kept writing to help her process her feelings and also record all the happy moments with Lawrence and Hannah and her stepson Dylan.Last year, Joanne heard about Jude Morrow, a Derry man with autism who had self-published a book about parenting his son.Judes book was a huge success and climbing up the Amazon best sellers list, so she got in touch to see what he thought about hers.He was hugely encouraging and told her to self-publish,advising her to spend a little money getting a cover designed for the book and to have it professionally edited.Joanne says self-publishing was a journey into unchartered waters, but she had the help of her dad and her self appointed PA Harry McGarvey.Just last week Joanne finally got her hands on the first copy of her book Memoirs of a Mad Mammy, but it was a bittersweet moment because she couldnt share it with Harry who was self-isolating due to the threat of the coronavirus.I left it on the garden wall for him and he was up at the window giving me air hugs, says Joanne.Copies of Memoirs of a Mad Mammy can be pre-ordered now on Amazon.It is also available on Kindle and will be available to buy at Little Acorns bookshop in Derry. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

For many older people in the city going to church is a pivotal part of their daily routine and may be the only time they get to socialise with friends. The essential lockdown announced by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson this week put a stop to all social events, including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. He did however add that ‘places of worship should remain open for solitary prayer’. googletag.cmd.push Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, Bishop of Derry Donal McKeown said the first priority of the Catholic Church is the people who are worried, lonely, feeling abandoned and people whose timetable has been turned upside down. “We’re looking for ways to reach people with materials that are going to be fulfilling to them. How can we help people who are in a very dferent situation than the one they were in a month ago,” he explained. There was a sense in the community that coronavirus hadn’t reached Northern Ireland yet, he said, and when it did people would ‘hunker down’ but the stark Westminster warning made it clear that ‘unless we clamp down now it will hit us in the not too distant future’. googletag.cmd.push Bishop McKeown said that some people have been of the opinion that churches were never closed before and shouldn’t be told to by the state now. “But I think we’re all clear in churches across Europe that bringing people together in groups on a regular basis for extended periods of time is deadly.” During Lent St Eugene’s Cathedral would have  people through the doors every day for daily Mass and , every weekend so the adjustment has been dficult for many. The Bishop was also conscious that priests themselves are used to providing services for people and they need support at this time in finding new ways of ministering after decades of ministering in one way. Four daily Masses are being live streamed, a series reflecting on the stained-glass windows have been posted online, interesting stories and Anne Marie Hickey sang one afternoon. “It’s a challenging time for everybody, in secular society and in church society, but what really is encouraging is that there has been such a huge uptake on webcam and Facebook streaming services.”  WEBCAM  Mass and a range of other devotions take place throughout the day from .am until .pm. For example, on Monday there were , hours of watching the webcam which accounted for , views and over , sessions of more than five minutes. The bulk of these viewers would be UK and Ireland based while others tuned in from the United States, South Africa, Malaysia, Peru and where. An Instagram page has also been set-up to engage with young people in the city. “People want to see the familiar, they could follow Mass at the Vatican or New York but want the reassurance of a local voice and it is helping people in their time of fear, recognising that things are going to get a lot worse before they get better,” Bishop McKeown concluded. CHALLENGING  Father Michael Canny of the Waterside Parish said that when the gravity of the coronavirus became apparent that his own parishioners, who would be in the older age bracket, found it hard to break away from their routine. “As time progressed and the penny dropped, most realised that they were in a very vulnerable category and I think that even before isolation was enforced a lot of them had been in lockdown to look after their own health. “They found it strange at the start and talked about not having masses but when the enormity of the situation dawned on them they very, very quickly took precautionary measures. “But I think they will find the latest regulations very challenging because before they could come out for a while and sit apart from other people.” The parish webcam has become more popular during the coronavirus outbreak but Father Canny said that people prefer to attend when they can to receive Holy Communion. “I understand that, they’ve lived through terrible times in the Troubles, some of them through the War times but they have never been deprived of going to Mass. It’s very, very strange.” Around - people would be watching Mass online but he believes church is all about community and once the current crisis passes he would like to see people coming together to celebrate Mass again. “There’s no substitute for actually coming out and meeting each other face to face and that has to be encouraged when this is all over.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans include prioritisation of patient care, reconfiguration of hospital services, urgent discharge of all medically fit patients, and an end to general hospital visiting – with very limited exceptions. Trusts will also be maximising and utilising all spare capacity in residential, nursingand domiciliary care. The plans are detailed in a letter to Trust chief executives from the Department’s Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly. Mr Pengelly’s letter to colleagues states: “Our health and social care system has never been more needed nor more under pressure than it is today. Right across our system, from top to bottom, people are shouldering this burden and doing all they can to prepare services for the full impact of Covid-. googletag.cmd.push “In that context, I want to start by putting on record my deep gratitude to you and everyone in your teams for the determination, commitment and energy being brought to this daunting task. I hope you all draw strength from the incredible public support that is evident for our health service and all those who work in it.” The letter acknowledges: “Eventhe social distancing measures have the impact we hope, our modelling still indicates that we will require more critical care capacity than is currently available.” Trusts had already moved to postpone all non-urgent elective appointments in order to free up stafffor additional training. googletag.cmd.push The next stage – in the event of the Covid- pandemic moving into dferent phases – will involve further measures to concentrate resources on essential patient care. “In some cases, it is recognised that this may mean that other services are temporarily reduced as the focus is on providing essential services and helping those most at risk access the best possible treatment. “It is therefore suggested that clinicians should begin to categorise patients into priority groups. The lowest prioritisation would be where treatment can be delayed for - months with no predicted negative outcome. Urgent and emergency treatments should continue to be given top priority.” Issues also dealt with in the letter include provision of Personal Protection Equipment , supply of ventilators and other respiratory equipment, Covid- testing, and staff accommodation. “For those staff affected by the -day household isolation policy, staff should - on an entirely voluntary basis - be offered the alternative option of staying in hotel accommodation while they continue to work. This should be organised locally by HSC Trusts.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This will include committing funds to support service level agreements and an extension of the community venues funds which have been in place for the last three years to ensure core costs will be in place to continue services.Council officers will contact impacted groups directly with letters of offer and advance payments as quickly as possible.An additional joint funding package is also being developed with the Department for Communities to support the continuation of the advice tribunal service, increasing telephone capacity and extending working hours. Council is hopeful that this investment will be confirmed shortly.During the meeting Council members paid tribute to local service providers Advice North West, Dove House and Resource Centre Derry and the work they are doing reaching out to the community under growing pressure, and stressed the importance of stepping up assistance at this stage.Councillors strongly welcomed these and other measures put forward, and agreed to further review demands on services and to lobby government for the necessary financial support to maintain and strengthen community services as needed to respond to the ongoing COVID emergency.A spokesperson for the three local service providers welcomed the news, saying: We are delighted that these resources are being made available.

Championships arent won with floating a ball into a bin, but on this evening, in the shadows of Carntogher, a competitive edge kicks in. The youngsters under Devlins guidance have a target to hit.

Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. googletag.cmd.push McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore. “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Schools are closed to all but the children of what the government has termed ‘key workers’ and parents are coming to terms with the challenge of ad-hoc home-schooling. The prospect of a y period off school may thrill pupils and terry parents in equal measure, but this is by no means an extended summer break. Here are some strategies you can use to help you and your child make it through what could be a tricky period for family relations. Create structure to the day googletag.cmd.push Many childrenthrive on the routine that their school day provides. Try to replicate this at home by setting out a timetable for study. Twitter user @andyharley has compiled a collection of graphics that can be used to create a home timetable to keep children aware of how their day will develop. This is particularly useful for children with special educational needs who may find the change in routine a little overwhelming. Read, read, read!  Long periods of time in the house are perfect for burying yourself in a good book. Now is a perfect time to escapism and what better way for a child to find it  googletag.cmd.push Local libraries have all shut their doors, but parents have a chance to sign up and download eBooks and audiobooks to keep their children reading. Oliver Jeffers, author of favourites like The Day the Crayons Quit and How to Catch a Star, is hosting a live reading every evening at pm on his Instagram page @oliverjeffers. This is a great chance for children to experience familiar books brought to le by the author who created them.Leading audiobook company Audible have also released a collection of stories available for children to stream online via this link. Keep responding to reading  A large part of the guided reading curriculum in school involves responding to what they are reading. While some readers may remember copious comprehension questions from their time at school, there are a number of activities that can be used to help with this. St Peter’s and St Paul’s, Foreglen principal Michael O’Kane has posted  guided reading activities that can be downloaded via PDF, PowerPoint or Keynote via his Twitter account. Mathletics – www.mathletics  Some of you may already be familiar with Mathletics as it is used in a number of schools. If not – get involved! Students can design their own avatar and compete against each other in a iety of challenges, activities and games. If your child is using the programme through school, they will have a log-in of their own, or you can sign up as a Home User on their website for a -hour free trial. There are plenty more free maths activities online – Topmarks, Maths Zone and Math Playground are just three examples. Google is your friend. Lego challenges An age-old favourite, Lego has been entertaining children and adults since its inception in . Many schools operate after-school Lego clubs and it has remained a staple favourite for Golden Time on Friday afternoons across the sector. Blogger Christina Shirley has shared a resource on her website that lists  days’ worth of Lego challenges for parents and children to get through. Of course, once the  days are up and you’ve got the hang of it, you can have a go at setting your child challenges yourself! Learn a language  I have banged the bilingualism drum for many years and now that the unexpected closures have left you with some time, now is the perfect time to learn a language. Duolingo has over  languages available on their online service and is an interactive way to pick up a language. While more suited to older users, this activity could be done together by parents and children, and the app is available to download on most devices.  Get activeBeing stuck at home all day can tempt many children into sedentary habits, but one of the most effective ways to ensure concentration is to get moving. Many schools operate brain breaks between lessons as well as the usual break and lunch play time and have found it increases pupil engagement and achievement. There are plenty of online videos that guide children through short bursts of exercise that are ideal for slotting into children’s timetables for a quick workout. Joe Wickshas been entertaining children on his YouTube channel since the beginning of lockdown and helping them stay alert and engaged. Keep an eye on your local GAA club too, as most have set challenges for their young players! Virtual museum tours  In the modern age, many museums can be accessed remotely via the internet. Website Southern Living has compiled a list of  famous museums that you can tour from the comfort of your own home. Write about it  Given a purpose and an audience, children love to write. With all that time going spare, encourage them to put pen to paperand create. If they are recording a diary of their time in lockdown, encourage them not only to focus on what is happening around them, but how they feel about it. Unprecedented situations can force creativity to the surface as a coping mechanism. We are happy to take submissions from children, young and old. Scan their work, take a photo, or email it to us via editor@derrynews.net,editor@derrypostor liam@derrypostand you could find yourself looking proudly at your work in the following week’s paper! Finally…forget all the above!  As much as we try and maintain as normal a routine as possible, these are not normal times, and worrying about your child falling behind in school is not the priority. Make use of the school packs, ideas and resources as much as you can but remember – this is not worth having a row about. Tension is already too high. Many parents are working from home while trying to balance childcare and the fuses may be running quite short, but children are in a vulnerable place. They have ied understanding of the situation. Some will be oblivious, some will sense the worried atmosphere and others may be concerned for the safety of elderly relatives. Get them out and about – social distancing permitting, and only once a day! – and use the time to let them experience the world around them. Go to the beach. Walk in the forest. Laugh. Eventually the world willto normal and children will tell anyone who will listen in years to come that they lived through the coronavirus pandemic of . They won’t remember immaculate timetables, multiplication revision or even the interactive learning they’ll do online – they’ll remember how they felt and what we did about it.

Minister Mallon said: “Just yesterday I confirmed MOT test centres would no longer be carrying out tests and that all vehicles eligible would be issued with a temporary exemption certicate . However, this could not be applied to four year old cars and taxis due to legal requirements. “I am pleased to confirm that following signicant work by my officials, I am now able to put arrangements in place to ensure four year old cars can get back on the road,given the ongoing health advice, the journey to be made is essential. googletag.cmd.push “From tomorrow, four year old cars will be given a TEC for six months from the date that their MOT test should have been due. This will allow the vehicle to be taxed and driven on the road. Issuing the certicates will take some time but the exemption will automatically apply from the due date. “The PSNI has agreed to our request that given these exceptional circumstances, where PSNI detects a vehicle without a valid MOT certicate, it will in suitable cases, exercise its discretion under the law, in circumstances where there is no identied risk to public safety. It is important that drivers realise that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times.” googletag.cmd.push The Minister continued that she and officials are continuing to urgently explore options to support taxis at this dficult time. “For taxis which require PSV tests, new regulation and legislation needs to be put in place to allow the legal issuing of Temporary Exemption Certicates and,despite best efforts, this is taking longer to resolve. However, I want to reassure taxi drivers that we are working urgently on options to help them at this dficult time. I recognise the taxi industry is being hard hit by this public health and economic crisis. I also am working with Executive colleagues and pushing hard for more support from the UK Government for the self-employed. Protecting drivers and the public from the serious impact of COVID- is my priority.” Alastair Ross, Head of Public Policy for Northern Ireland at the Association of British Insurers, said: “Insurers recognise that this is worrying time for everyone and will take a pragmatic view. They will not penalise customers for something that is entirely out of their control and where motorists with an MOT exemption certicate request a quote, they will not be prejudiced by their lack of a valid MOT certicate. This applies regardless of whether they wish to renew with their existing insurance provider or are looking to take out a policy with a dferent insurer. “Insurers do, however, expect that motorists comply with their legal obligation to keep their vehicle in a roadworthy conditionthey are driving it. Those affected by the ongoing MOT testing suspension should continue to service their vehicle and carry out basic checks such as looking out for brake wear, ensuring that all lights are working and that windscreen liquid and oil are at the correct levels.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Letrsquos look out for each other in these turbulent times.Cllr McMurray mdash who spoke ahead of Mondayrsquos ban on access to Tyrella beach mdash said that last weekend he had been ldquoinundated with messages and calls regarding the number of people attending local forest parks.ldquoUnfortunately, it appears that the general population is not adhering to the advice in relation to social distancing and I would suggest that they are nearly treating this crisis as a national holiday.I will be reviewing access to our forest parks with party leaders and senior management team, he said.ldquoWe have been pushing a lot of advice and guidance with regard to the need for social distancing but it is not resting with the population. It is so dficult to balance the need to allow people the space to walk to protect mental and health and well-being, but we ask that the public refer to guidelines set out by public health officials to do so safely.Cllr Lewis said the closure of leisure centres, play areas, council-owned facilities and schools across this district had been done for peoplersquos safety.ldquoI appeal to people to recognise why these areas are closed, he continued. ldquoPlay parks and sporting facilities should not be used. It is imperative that we recognise and accept the seriousness of this illness. It simply cannot be business as usual, we must heed all relevant medical advice.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThis is for our own safety, while also protecting the integrity of our health service and those vital, dedicated experienced staff who support it. Newry, Mourne and Down Council has taken extreme measures and please respect these steps. This isnrsquot a holiday and itrsquos not a jolly. We are protecting le.Cllr Gallagher said it was vital that everyone in the community ensures that social isolation is adhered to, highlighting the need to reduce the risk.He added: ldquoThe elderly and those with predisposed health conditions need to keep their distance and follow public health guidelines. Remain at homepossible and get someone to do your shopping. Family units are important. People must not allow others into their home and visits that are not essential must stopCllr Howell said that last week the Education Minister finally declared that schools would close to help prevent the spread of COVID-, highlighting the huge responsibility on parents to ensure that not just children are safe, but so are those they are in contact with.She added: ldquoUnfortunately, some young people think that this is the start of their summer holidays and they are free to continue with no worries or concerns. I am appealing to parents to inform their children about social distancing and the importance of adhering to the public health guidelines.ldquoIf your teenager goes out can you be confident that they will observe the required social distancing of two metres  Many of them donrsquot have the willpower to practice what is being advised.ldquoAs a parent I know only too well how hard it is to keep teenagers from going out, but we need to set the example to our children. If these social distancing rules are not adhered to, they will come home and unknowingly pass the virus to others, perhaps family members with underlying health issues or aged grandparents..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 Pretend.jpg","title":"‘Pretend cough’ over credit union worker  ","story":"POLICE will be contacted after a saver in Downpatrick Credit Union ldquopretend coughed at a staff member last week during the coronavirus outbreak, it has been revealed.Mary Cullen, chair of Downpatrick Credit Union, warned that it was now operating a ldquozero tolerance policy as incidents of verbal abuse to staff increased during reduced opening hours.She said the credit union, which is situated in Market Street, had been inundated with messages of support after she posted a warning post on Facebook last Friday where she asked members to respect everyonersquos boundaries regarding social distancing and to accept the new reduced hours cover.She said a member of the public verbally abused a member of staff before ldquopretend coughing at them.ldquoThis particular incident is not acceptable and going forward, unfortunately, Members who cannot be courteous to our staff will not be served, said Mary in her post.ldquoWe are in a very dangerous time and are doing the best that we can. We are very lucky to have an amazing team at DCU, letrsquos appreciate and respect them as they try to continue to provide a service to members.ldquoThe support for my staff has been phenomenal. Members have contacted me to express their sadness and disgust that anyone could behave in such a manner.One shocked local person commented: ldquoWhat is actually wrong with people being totally ignorant to what is happening.Several people called for the person to be banned from the credit union.Mary said that the staff had to adopt themselves to the changed methods of operation and service in the public health crisis.ldquoWe have had a fair amount of verbal abuse since implementing restrictions on the number of people in the banking hall at any one time and staff have been working tirelessly to ensure a safe environment for all by encouraging social distancing, she explained. ldquoWe will continue to monitor member activity and behaviour and have a zero tolerance policy now in place.However, she warned: ldquoAny member who does not respect the boundaries in place or who proceeds to abuse staff will be asked to leave the building, I have told the staff that the Board support them ,% and continue to do so.ldquoI will be making contact with the member and we will be pursuing this matter through the PSNI.The credit union is from .am to .pm on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday and from .am-pm on Saturday.

If people did go out, they were advised to keep two metres apart.Council officials say the latest closures are part of the organisationrsquos ongoing coronavirus response and that the decision will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with Public Health Agencyguidance.Last week, council officials had decided to keep Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park open and had agreed to waive the entrance fee to both facilities. But there was a dramatic U-turn on Monday when these two popular facilities also went into lockdown.Across the district a range of community events have been cancelled with last Sundayrsquos horse race meeting at Downpatrick taking place behind closed doors, with spectators locked out.The local authority want people to obey self-distancing requirements with its decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park further evidence of its concern about people spreading the virus.It is clear that both facilities have now been placed in the ldquohigh risk category alongside the districtrsquos leisure and community centres. Local politicians say that their key priority is to protect the public and staff.The closure of Tyrella and Delamont comes after Sundayrsquos sunshine brought people out in their hundreds to ious locations across the district, despite government advice not to engage in mass gatherings.beachAnyone in Newcastle town centre last Sunday could have been forgiven for thinking that it was Easter, while nearby Murlough beach was crammed with visitors.It was a similar scene in Ballyhornan and along other parts of the Lecale coastline, including Kilclief and Killard.Rowallane councillor Kathryn Owens said she fully supported the decision to close Tyrella beach and Delamont Country Park.She said: ldquoI totally support this decision. It may not be popular, but sometimes we need to take the tough decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, after the droves of people went to local parks and forests on Sunday, it appears people still arenrsquot taking the coronavirus issue seriously and are clearly flouting PHA guidelines.Cllr Owens added: ldquoThis is not a decision that Newry, Mourne and Down Council wanted to take as we had hoped that common sense may have prevailed. It was a decision we were forced to take and we must do all we can to stop the spread of this disease..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/25th March 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 25%2C 1980  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Grand Cinema is to re-open in September, six years after it closed its doors.Workmen will move in shortly to give the cinema a pound, facelt and when the picture house is re-opened, it should be able to compete with the best in Ireland.That is the aim of Mr Harley Breen, the owner of the cinema, who this week outlined the work which needs to be completed before the curtain opens.ldquoWork is expected to take around six months and will involve completely refurbishing the inside of the cinema, Mr Breen explained.ldquoWe will be taking out all the seating and replacing it with a new type of seating, the most exclusive available.

Her previous experience had been restricted to cars, tractors and Land Rovers, but she was always keen on tackling something bigger.ldquoBeing so fond of driving, it was only natural that I would take such a job. Lorries were out of the question, as drivers often have to load their vehicles, so when I say the advert for bus drivers I thought I would apply, said Noelene.ldquoI never thought it possible that they would accept me, so it was a pleasant surprise when I was offered the chance to attend the Ulsterbus training school. I was the only female among the drivers, but that didnrsquot deter me.BALLYGOWAN mdash A teenage Ballygowan girl has ben congratulated by the Northern Ireland Hotel Catering Association for her success at a recent salon culinaire.Margaret Wilson won the gold award in the junior section and this earned her praise from the Association.Margaret had been attending the Associationrsquos catering course at the college in Portrush this year, having progressed from Downpatrick Technical College where she passed the pre-catering course to earn qualication.She was entered by the Association for the salon culinaire at Belfast Castle at the start of the month, and her win prompted them to write to the South Eastern Education and Library Board to congratulate them on such an outstanding pupil.The Associationrsquos letter was read at Tuesdaysrsquo Board meeting, where members were pleased to se Margaretrsquos progress.

He wrote: ldquoSo I turned with all my heart to the Lord My God...He protected me and he consoled me as a Father for his son...There is no other God...The Lord God said through the prophet, lsquoCall on me in the day of distress and I will set you free and you will glory mersquo.They said this is a reminder that ldquoGod truly is our shield in the stre.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away. For others who have been out for a little bit longer, they may need more of a refresher because, of course, its vital that we keep people safe, thats the whole point of the NHS.\"So the letter will go out today, well then be engaging inidually with all those who respond and I very much hope that many, many thousands will respond.\"From those Ive talked to, I think people can see just how important this is. The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.
