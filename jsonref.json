Bright-yellow stripes are being applied to the pavement at now-familiar two-metre intervals outside the school’s three sets of gates, and over the next few days, these markers will appear in classrooms, too. In between, dedicated routes will be laid out to take children safely from the school gates to their classroom doors.These plans, orchestrated by Bonneville’s headteacher, Andrea Parker, were being rolled out as the school prepared to reopen its doors to reception, year 1 and year 6 pupils in line with the latest government guidelines. Schools, colleges and nurseries across England welcomed more children and students from 1 June onwards – and headteachers like Parker are busy preparing to embrace a new way of learning.“For every headteacher, keeping children safe is going to be at the top of their priorities”, says Parker, who is also the lead headteacher for Jessop primary and Stockwell primary schools. “We began our preparations by sending out a survey to check the pulse of how teachers and parents were feeling about returning to school. From there, we were able to start modelling what we need to do to support our families, and help them to feel more confident in sending their children back.”Since lockdown, the school has continued to take in around 25 of its 420 pupils each day, split into smaller groups for safety – the children of key workers, those from vulnerable families, or with education, health and care plans in place. “We’ve been open every day during lockdown,” says Parker. “Staff members even volunteered to work through the holidays, which has been fantastic.”Meanwhile, those teachers who have remained at home have been working on providing the online resources parents need for home schooling. “Overnight, we’ve all had to completely change how we work on a day-to-day basis with no training and no transition period, and teachers have been working incredibly hard to achieve that,” she says.At the same time, Parker believes temporary home schooling can’t replace the benefits of schools-based education, especially when it comes to the transitions experienced by those children who will begin returning to school from 1 June.“Reception, year 1 and year 6 are all key milestones,” she says. “Younger children are in the early stages of their education, and we want to be there for them as they develop their reading and friendship groups, and simply learn how to learn.“At the other end of the spectrum, year 6 are about to go to secondary school. It’s a time when they celebrate their SATs and everything they’ve achieved and worked hard for.”The Bonneville school building, which dates back to 1905, is large and welcoming. When I visit, days before reopening, crafted cardboard models of sea animals hang from the ceilings, and children’s work covers every inch of spare space on the walls.With only a fraction of the school’s 420 pupils in attendance – including Parker’s own six-year-old daughter, who is in school as the child of a key worker – the sound of children’s laughter, which usually fills these hallways, can only faintly be heard drifting in from the playground.“Our teachers are very excited and as desperate to see the children as I am,” she says. “They’re anxious, too, but going through our risk assessments with them has helped a lot.“With fewer children coming back to start with, we don’t need everybody to be here, which means those who are very anxious can be asked to come back later on. Hopefully they’ll see how things are working and their confidence will build – some people just need that, much like the parents who need to have a choice.”Home schooling for those children who remain at home will continue to be supported by teachers, but to reassure those who do send their children in, a raft of safety measures has been put in place.At the school gates, parents are required to socially distance from each other (guided by those painted stripes) during staggered drop-offs. “Bubbles” of up to 15 children will be dropped off together, with an allocated “bubble lead” – the class teacher – taking students into the building in shifts.Before entering their classroom, they sanitise their hands before being allocated a desk each for taking lessons, watching pre-recorded assemblies, and eating lunch, which will be delivered at the door. Outside space will be utilised for lessons as much as possible, while playtime and PE will be enjoyed within the children’s inidual groups.“Although younger children will be in smaller groups, it’s not just about the size of each bubble – it’s about dynamics as well,” says Parker. “Children are people with their own personalities and their own way of being, so we have to make sure each one is a manageable group and dynamic.”Extra hygiene measures include specific play and sports equipment allocated to each bubble, regular handwashing, staggered bathroom breaks followed by janitor cleaning, and early closing on Friday afternoons for deep-cleaning sessions. The early Friday closure will also be used to facilitate statutory planning and preparation time for teachers. The school has also drawn up sets of principles that parents, teachers and children will be asked to adhere to.For staff, these include having an awareness of each other – for example, no more than two teachers in the staffroom at a time. For children, the principles include reinforcing the NHS’s Catch it, Bin it, Kill it messaging. For parents, coming to collect children as quickly as possible if they fall ill.Bonneville has also worked to tailor specific solutions to the erse community the school serves. “In terms of the country Lambeth is hugely erse”, says Parker, citing the borough’s significant Caribbean, African and Asian communities, as well as pupils from Spanish-, French- and Portuguese-speaking backgrounds.“We know that the BAME community have surfaced as being prone to having a higher rate of infection”, says Parker, explaining that the school’s risk assessment process is being developed with the heightened vulnerability of BAME students, staff and their wider community in mind.Communicating to children why their schools have changed is a crucial part of helping them adapt to their new regimes, so Parker plans to share a virtual tour of the new school layout with pupils, and plug lessons about the roles of key workers into the curriculum.Parker’s plans have focused on building confidence among children, staff and parents, and communicating with them every step of the way. “It’s about trying to adapt, even though we don’t know how long we’re going to be adapting for,” she says.Check with your Local Authority for the latest news on schools opening in your area.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

For this project she returned to her grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg to explore themes of memory, isolation and female identity across three generations of her familyThe images in this series address questions of claustrophobic spaces. They convey a sense of being locked down, however they were taken last year before the emergence of Covid-19. They were snapped inside my grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg, which for many years she has hardly left. As long as I can remember my grandmother’s world has conveyed a sense of being locked down. She leaves the flat once a week to get groceries and a TV guide from the shop directly below her apartment. In the winter she doesn’t leave the flat for three months because it’s too cold and windy outside, or too slippery.To keep entertained, Babushka cooks, washes dishes, mends clothes and watches TV. Under Russia’s coroanvirus lockdown measures she isn’t allowed to travel more than 200 metres from her apartment. This is something she has hardly done in the past 10 years, so her life is relatively unchanged.With the intention of exploring my Russian connections, I made two trips to the country in September and December 2019. In this small apartment I made portraits of my grandmother (Babushka), my mother (Svetlana) and myself, in various configurations. I also documented the daily routines and minutiae of my grandmother’s life – the furnishings, her food and pickles, her decor and the ubiquitous television screen that is her main connection to the outside world.The reality I’m depicting here for my grandmother has not changed much she has always lived in this way. Since my grandfather died 10 years ago, her life has become increasingly isolated. My grandmother took care of me for the first four years of my life so, for me, the apartment is like a time capsule. When I visit I am treated like I’m still a child and it doesn’t feel like much changes, though at times I have not returned for years. The routine and familiarity of life in this apartment can be both bleak and comforting and I set myself the challenge of building a visual narrative with photographs taken only within its confines. I saw this work was as the beginning of a long-term process of engagement with my family history and I hadn’t anticipated that a depiction of this claustrophobic isolation would be so pertinent to what’s happening today.My grandmother was born at the start of the second world war, which brought starvation and many other privations. She experienced temporary blindness as a child and has permanent partial deafness as a result of the war. My mother grew up in communist Russia, when travel outside of the Soviet Union was not possible. As a young woman she lived through perestroika and also experienced immense hardship there was no food on the shelves and basic items were rationed. During this time there was also a lot of fear surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.My grandmother sewing in her bedroom, one of the common places you may find her in her flat at midday.The traumas of state violence, war and gender violence weigh heavily on my family. My great grandfather, a victim of Stalin’s purges, was executed in the 1930s. I was born in Russia, but came to Britain at the age of four, after my mother fled my abusive and violent father.With this project I wanted to engage with my family history and investigate my grandmother’s life and the relationships between her, my mother and me. I felt that through exploring this one small confined space I could find something typically Russian but universally human. I am particularly interested in the idea of post-memory, and in understanding the ways family trauma may be passed down through the generations. I am also interested in how we create and project on to our own pasts.My intention is to place female narratives, so often neglected, at the centre of this project. I hope this depiction of the lives of three ordinary women will represent something universal about the bonds of love and history that connect generations of women around the world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f44919095bb6193b10e2668c7588211ef683b00/0_248_2772_1663/master/2772.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed4625af60d36dd363fa925f7014b27","title":"great british art quiz university liverpool victoria gallery museum","story":"The University of Liverpool’s Victoria Gallery and Museum set today’s quiz, in our series exploring the art collections of British museums closed due to Covid-19This quiz is brought to you in collaboration with\u0026nbspArt UK, the online home for the UK’s public art collections, showing art from more than 3,000 venues and by 45,000 artists.

Some have been displayed at the firm’s Waterside headquarters near Heathrow, but many of the 1,500 artworks in the collection have been on the walls of its executive lounges.However, with some analysts believing that the lucrative business travel market may never return to pre-crisis levels, lounges are likely to have more austere decor in future.According to the Evening Standard, Sotheby’s has valued a number of works held by BA for a potential imminent sale, with one piece by Bridget Riley – described by some as a masterpiece – likely to leave BA’s Heathrow executive lounge and raise millions for the embattled airline.The move comes as the majority of BA’s fleet remains grounded because of the coronavirus pandemic, with all of the aviation industry facing an uncertain future.Álex Cruz, the airliner’s chief executive, had promised to “take every possible action to conserve cash” when BA notified unions it was planning redundancies. The minimum consultation period for up to 12,000 redundancies passes on 15 June, potentially allowing the airline to start shedding staff, although BA has said it does not expect to do so on that date.British Airways did not comment on the art selloff, but a source said the airline was not ruling anything out to save money and jobs, and the idea is believed to have been taken up by management after asking staff where to find savings.IAG, its owning group, recently said it was burning through cash at a rate of €30m (£26.7m) a day. Plans to restore many flights in July are currently under review while IAG attempts to overturn the government’s quarantine rules, introduced on Monday.​BA said: “We are acting now to protect as many jobs as possible. The airline industry is facing the deepest structural change in its history, as well as facing a severely weakened global economy.”The Unite union, one of three representing BA workers, has disputed the need for mass redundancies. Len McCluskey, the general secretary, said: “The company is claiming to be in financial difficulties while\u0026nbspBA’s Spanish parent company IAG is still planning to spend close to €1bn to buy another airline, Air Europa.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2d6d9bd802ff7b2ba8b8b820f1fee848459f81f/0_16_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2efb35676c44a24436a1635f2904a662","title":"just eat uber grubhub takeover food delivery service","story":"Planned takeover will create world’s largest food delivery service outside ChinaEuropean food delivery service Just Eat Takeaway has agreed to buy the US-based app Grubhub for $7.3bn (£5.8bn) in a deal that would create the world’s largest food delivery service outside China.Confirmation of the all-stock takeover deals a blow to Uber, which has its own food delivery business and was reportedly in discussions with Grubhub.The tie-up will give the Netherlands-based Just Eat Takeaway access to the lucrative food delivery market in the US, with the combined business able to serve customers in 25 countries.

Power usage in the UK has plunged as offices and factories have shut. Bad debts will inevitably rise among small businesses and British Gas consumers.

The company said: Centrica has over 80 different employee contracts, each with multiple variants, with many of the agreements dating back over 35 years. We need to modernise these to enable us to best serve the changing expectations of today’s customers while retaining the quality of our services. Centrica chief executive Chris O’Shea is only three months into the job, having abruptly taken over from Iain Conn as the crisis hit. He said:I believe that our complex business model hinders the delivery of our strategy and inhibits the relentless focus I want to give to our customers. We have great people, strong brands that are trusted by millions and leading market positions, but the harsh reality is that we have lost over half of our earnings in recent years.

In normal times that would indicate that economic prospects were apparently unchanged, a reading that is patently untrue.The Fed’s dovish tone, suggesting the stimulus will keep coming, initially pushed up stocks last night, but eventually the mood soured. Seeing as the Fed made it clear they will be keeping rates close to zero for a few years, US stocks were initially pushed up by the announcement, but the bullish move didn’t last There could be further doses of reality for investors later when the latest US initial unemployment claims come through, showing how many people felt they needed to claim out-of-work benefits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a0a40a80056b840c12eecf9293cb68a623f8d34/0_371_8160_4898/master/8160.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=420347ab047bd3506ba7d02a7108cb89","title":"black lives matter racism bristol colston","story":"There are three powerful words that do expose discrimination. But you won’t find them on a poster, or chanted in the streetIf I hear one more white person say “Black Lives Matter” I think my head will explode. The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning.\u0026nbspA way for people to endlessly repeat “I hate racism” while doing nothing to actually stop it.\u0026nbspWhite people, I assume you don’t like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin. But that’s such a basic sentiment that you shouldn’t be giving yourself a buzz from saying it.When even Boris Johnson can say “Black Lives Matter”\u0026nbsp– the same Boris Johnson who talks of African piccaninnies, of “bank robber” burqa wearers, who leads a party riven by Islamophobia but refuses a proper investigation into it, and who was part of a government that deported black British citizens, and continues the injustice of the hostile environment to this day – well, you know the slogan’s cultural appropriation is complete.\u0026nbspEven racists hate racism. That’s why they’re always looking for ways to excuse what they do. “It’s not my fault – black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.” “I’m not being racist – it’s just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.” “I’d love to recruit a black person – it’s just that they’re not quite the right fit for this role.”“It’s just that …” You won’t find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They’re the words people say in private – or don’t say – when they’re making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.\u0026nbspOver the past few days I’ve wondered, why\u0026nbspnow? Why,\u0026nbspafter all we’ve known about police brutality against black people,\u0026nbspare people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there’s not a lot else for young people to do.\u0026nbspThe anger is genuine, but the usual distractions that stop people from turning out have gone.\u0026nbspIt’s the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.\u0026nbspBut the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations,\u0026nbspfor most white people there’s always been a get-out.No white person\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspcould believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.That’s why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people\u0026nbspdeclaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.\u0026nbspThough \u0026nbspmany of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they’re starting to notice.\u0026nbspThis was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd,\u0026nbspwould the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?Many British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But\u0026nbspwhat a glorious moment. It’s an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say “Black Lives Matter” a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.\u0026nbspWhen I saw\u0026nbspFloyd’s life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the\u0026nbspBlack Lives Matter\u0026nbspmovement swept across the US in 2014.\u0026nbspSurely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions\u0026nbsp.\u0026nbspThere are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we’re going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won’t be by simply calling for more black police officers. That’s been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won’t be just by rooting out “bad apples”: a system that allows them\u0026nbspin unchecked\u0026nbspin the first place is already rotten to the core. It won’t simply be by giving all officers “ersity training”: a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they’re back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.\u0026nbspOn the day\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthe first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday,\u0026nbspthe politan police commissioner, Cressida Dick,\u0026nbspwas giving evidence to the London assembly.\u0026nbspShe\u0026nbspwas talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown – double the rate for white people.This is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels,\u0026nbspthat affect\u0026nbspthousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.\u0026nbspBarack Obama\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspset out an intelligent long-term plan – “How to make this moment the turning point for real change” – which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.\u0026nbspIn the UK we have to be equally thoughtful – so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.• Joseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41af6b3f4e405f84d5c615a3241b5947c70bef08/0_87_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=67cf8d69014122c967eb178ba66be5e8","title":"pandemic scientists second wave coronavirus","story":"A second wave of coronavirus cases would be disastrous – but there are ways to prevent this happeningOver the weekend, there were no new deaths from coronavirus in London, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Slowly, the number of hospitalisations and deaths is falling across the UK. Rather than celebrating these early signs that the worst of the pandemic could be behind us, however,\u0026nbspsome scientists are warning\u0026nbspof a second wave of infections – an increase in coronavirus cases in the coming weeks or months, which could occur even after a sustained fall\u0026nbspin the number of cases.\u0026nbspThese warnings often refer back to the 1918 flu pandemic. That outbreak killed tens of millions of people\u0026nbspwhen it returned the following winter in a deadlier form\u0026nbspafter the first outbreak had been controlled.\u0026nbspBut there’s a confusing lack of consensus from scientists about whether we’ll see a second wave of coronavirus cases.\u0026nbspAlthough the future is uncertain, we can imagine four scenarios for what might come next.\u0026nbspOne\u0026nbsphypothesis, floated by doctors in Italy, is that coronavirus could grow weaker as it spreads. Through viral mutation, Sars-Cov-2 could lose its potency and become milder or less infectious.\u0026nbspBut coronaviruses have proven a remarkably stable type of virus.\u0026nbspThere is no evidence to support this kind of mutation occurring in a matter of years, let alone weeks. Rather than viral mutations, improvements in survival rates in Italy are probably related to better clinical management of Covid-19, as doctors learn how to treat patients in hospital more effectively.But the picture might be more complex.\u0026nbspA recent study\u0026nbspreported that iniduals who had never been exposed to Sars-Cov-2 still\u0026nbsphad T-cells reacting to the virus, another key component of the body’s immune response. The authors of the study suggested that having previous exposure to common cold coronaviruses could\u0026nbspmean the body is able\u0026nbspto detect the proteins in the Sars-Cov-2 virus.\u0026nbspWhile this finding could be promising, there is still no\u0026nbspevidence that either antibodies or T-cell reactivity would result in\u0026nbspsomeone developing immunity to Sars-Cov-2.A third approach, which has been deliberately adopted in Sweden, is to let the virus run its course and spread through the population. This treats Covid-19 much like the influenza virus until a vaccine becomes available or enough of the population is exposed that herd immunity develops, the virus will be unstoppable.But the cost of allowing the virus to spread through the population until it develops herd immunity is that many people will become\u0026nbspill\u0026nbspor die as a result of catching Covid-19. And with no confirmation on how long immunity would even last, this approach offers no certainty about whether people could become reinfected after a couple of months or years – leading to a second wave of infections.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMy own view is that\u0026nbspwe can avoid a\u0026nbspsecond wave\u0026nbspif governments aggressively contain the virus through testing, tracing and isolating carriers, and by encouraging good hygiene, such as hand-washing and environmental disinfection, supported by physical distancing where it’s needed. The goal is to drive down numbers of cases to a low level so that transmission is limited to discrete, containable outbreaks with the ultimate goal of elimination.\u0026nbspThink of this\u0026nbspas a series of constantly emerging small fires that need to be extinguished quickly before they turn into an uncontrollable blaze. South Korea and Germany have effectively run with this approach,\u0026nbsprolling out mass testing and tracing strategies, isolating carriers of the virus and implementing monitoring systems to map its spread.But the focus on deaths from a second wave may miss the real toll of the virus: the\u0026nbsplong-term damage\u0026nbspit can cause to the lungs, heart, kidneys, brain and even blood vessels among those who recover. This is emerging as one of the horrors of Covid-19. It is often forgotten that Covid-19 is a completely new virus, completely different to the flu, and that it might have longer-term health impacts that will only be identified in months or years.If coronavirus is\u0026nbspour generations’s polio, we might look towards the approach taken by governments in the Pacific.\u0026nbspNew Zealand has eliminated coronavirus, and Australia is\u0026nbspinching closer\u0026nbspto this goal. With border checks in place, people living in these countries can return to normal life. Sports matches are taking place in New Zealand, schools have reopened, weddings are being booked and\u0026nbsppeople can safely see relatives.\u0026nbspThe successes of New Zealand and Australia might force other countries to rethink their own strategies, and the feasibility of eliminating the virus within their borders. Instead of living with a constant threat of Covid-19, people might start asking their own governments – why not\u0026nbsptry to get rid of it altogether?• Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1c8cd59478d1b8d37f6a90eb6af0ed0429728ee/7_49_5118_3071/master/5118.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ea36f889d24db95e5bc630d593052bf","title":"i cant afford my student housing during lockdown so im striking","story":"Tomasz Jabłonśki is one of around 200 tenants on a rent strike in his student accommodation buildingI was working in a pub before the coronavirus outbreak, which was enough to cover my rent at Dinwiddy House in King’s Cross during my first year studying social anthropology at Soas University of London. I was also getting some money from my family back in Poland, to help with food and other basics. But I was put on furlough when the coronavirus lockdown started at the end of March, and I returned home.I rented from the student housing company Sanctuary Students, who are demanding that I pay during lockdown, even though I don’t use the facilities and left the room completely empty, and also won’t be back in the UK until about January next year because my course is going to be online. This is a time when other housing providers have offered students a pass on this term’s rent, and I strongly believe\u0026nbspthis is what Sanctuary Students should do too. So, along with around 200 other students, I joined a rent strike.Sanctuary Students is treating us as if we are only using the pandemic to get away without paying rent, not people who just left their accommodation to be with our families and loved ones due to the virus. Many of us lost jobs and just cannot pay.\u0026nbspWe agreed that we should stand in solidarity until they release us from our contracts.I then received a letter from a debt collection company asking me to pay the outstanding debt of £1,735.69 in seven days, threatening me that if not, they would take more direct action against me.When I got this letter, I talked to the students’ union and they told me they were contacting lawyers to figure out how to approach this. I also told the debt collector that I’m involved in a strike and that they shouldn’t contact me directly, and to negotiate with the students’ union. We wrote an open letter signed by many people who are living in Sanctuary Students housing, and we’re waiting to see what happens next.I’m very anxious about how this situation will develop. I worry that, if I go back to London next year, I won’t be able to get accommodation, and if I have outstanding debts my credit score will be lowered.\u0026nbspIt hasn’t been possible to work in Poland, so I couldn’t collect enough money to pay the rent even if I wanted to. I can’t be sure I’ll be rehired by the pub when I’m back in the UK either. My parents are trying to help me in any way possible but they can’t do much. They don’t have enough money, and they don’t really understand the situation in London.\u0026nbspWe’re standing firm. If any of us start paying this rent, the strike doesn’t have enough power to make any change. Coronavirus is not over yet and its effects are going to be felt for many months after the pandemic is over.

But Covid-19 has given him a new perspective on how humans can live in harmony with the natural world ‘I’m tramping through damp, long grass in the wake of two poodles,” Chris Packham tells me, over the phone, at nine in the morning, from his home near Southampton. “One of the joys of the UK is this rich, verdant colour at this time of year, so green that it’s almost blinding.” The naturalist’s voice, compelling and contemplative, draws you in and slows you down, to the point where you are concentrating hard enough to see what he describes, even when you can’t.Generally, of course, you can see it: Springwatch has been back on screens, packed with the images – baby birds with their gaping maws, treecreepers blinking – we have always cherished and lately come to rely on. Packham, 59, has such a natural, contagious sincerity in his enthusiasm that he should be in the “national treasure” class, one of those rare figures who unites the country and is immune from politics. But he determinedly is not – he won’t, today, talk about grouse, hen harriers or any of those bird-cruelty issues that have brought him death threats of the most lurid kind (dead birds hung up by his gatepost, Twitter abuse too awful to detail). The BBC, I am given to understand, would prefer him not to speak on these topics. But in January he fell foul of the neutrality police in another way: while promoting his documentary about the global population, he said that, for the sake of the planet, people should consider having fewer children (he has no biological children).Packham admits the idea is controversial, but “I approach things as a pragmatic biologist”, he says, calmly. “There’s not a racist cell in my body I don’t think of humans as being different.” That was not my question, although he has been accused – nefariously, he says – of singling out countries such as Nigeria, and therefore pointing the finger at sub-Saharan Africa, when “the real problem is what you and I are consuming”. “Ultimately, we are all the same species, in the same place, at the same time, with the same problem, and if we don’t start thinking collectively to sort it out, then we won’t do it,” he says. “A global conversation about how many people the planet can sustain is something that has to happen.”\u0026nbspI happen to disagree – if you look at the recent work of the social geographer Danny Dorling, it shows that birth rates are already in decline worldwide we are entering a natural slowdown. What we have not managed to slow down is rich people’s consumption.But, in a way, this makes me admire Packham all the more: there is enough to contest in these choppy waters that he could avoid them altogether and still hold his head high as a passionate defender of the natural world. He does not play it safe, nor does he skirt the largest, most uncomfortable implications of his analysis. He worries constantly – about the IPCC’s warning that we have 10 years to solve the climate crisis, about the strongman politics dominating the world stage, about the loss of bioersity and the long-term impact that will have on harvests – but he does not\u0026nbspsound\u0026nbspworried. He sounds like a man telling you that your boiler is broken, but he knows how to fix it.We need better leaders, given that we are living under “undoubtedly the worst portfolio of politicians that we could possibly have imaged in our lifetime”, and we need to “shape a new world” after the pandemic, with the environment at the centre of our decision-making. On reflection, we all know how to fix this boiler, just as we all enjoy the sight of a ladybird, but it is soothing and exciting to hear it described.Packham always says of his early life, growing up in Hampshire, that he was a bit difficult, emotionally adrift, until he took a baby kestrel from its nest when he was 14 and fell violently in love with it. This led to a zoology degree, at the University of Southampton. He got into TV not via presenting, but in production, for the BBC’s 1984 series The Living Planet. His career as a presenter started with The Really Wild Show, in 1986, when he electrified the nature scene with his Gary Rhodes hair and his apparently effortless fluency.He has an endearing Dr Dolittle quality the defining images of his career capture him cuddling an animal or bird that does not like to be cuddled. Here he is with an owl, now with a badger. He is much more evangelist than showman.\u0026nbsp“I probably got as much joy out of other people reconnecting with nature as I have got from reconnecting with nature myself,” he says of the lockdown period. “It’s been an absolute joy to see people posting pictures with ladybirds on their fingers and frogs in their ponds and birds singing in their gardens, but they will now have to join our ranks and remember what they took from that, because we do have to fight for it.”As the pandemic confined us all to our homes, he and his 25-year-old stepdaughter, Megan McCubbin, launched The Self-Isolating Bird Club: half an hour a day of guerrilla twitching, broadcast on Facebook every morning. “People seemed to like it,” he says (7.8 million of them tuned in). He and McCubbin have since taken their double act to Springwatch. “The producers of Springwatch liked our on-screen rapport. I call it bickering, they call it on-screen rapport.”\u0026nbspHe is keen to stress that McCubbin is a good, sound zoologist in her own right: “She knows her stuff, she likes science and understanding things. She loves finding out things that I don’t know and she does that very easily.” You would struggle to say who is the straight man of the double act – they are both incredibly, winningly geeky.McCubbin is the daughter of Packham’s ex-partner, Jo McCubbin. They split up years ago, but Packham remained a large and influential part of her life – she came to zoology partly thanks to time she spent at the Isle of Wight zoo run by Packham’s partner, Charlotte Corney. He describes these relationships as “a relatively confused – but not too unusual, these days – family setup.” They all get on very well. “Charlotte goes to Jo’s parties I don’t. I’m not a party sort of person.” (I am reminded of the joke about the doctor, the lawyer and the mathematician who are each asked whether it is better to have a wife or a mistress. The doctor says it is better for your health to be married. The lawyer says it is better for your finances to be unmarried. The mathematician says: “It is better to have a wife\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspa mistress – then they can chat and you can go off and do maths.”)He is relatively equanimous about the restrictions of the pandemic, as you might imagine of a person who does not like parties. But he is deadly serious about Covid-19. “Speaking entirely biologically, what the whole, horribly harsh, tragic lesson of the virus has taught us is that we are part of nature we’re not there to hold dominion over it, we’re not above it.“We’ve always been exposed to pathogens – everything from smallpox to bubonic plague. We’ve beaten them through our advances in science and I’m not regretting that. But we are an organism, living on a planet, and the way we were living was unsustainable. We were overcrowded, we were eating animals that we’d shipped alive from one part of the world to another, and we’re paying a terrible price for it.”This is not a million miles away from the putative Extinction Rebellion (XR) stickers, disavowed by the group as fake, that read “Corona is the cure, humans are the virus”. But he reiterates that he is not against medical advances he is very much in favour of people living long and healthy lives. Nevertheless, he does not situate the plight of mankind at the centre of his thinking we are no more than one part of an infinitely precious ecosystem – and we are the part causing the problems.This is the kernel of his radicalism – and no broadcaster’s duty of impartiality will make him disavow it, nor his support for XR and similar movements. “That’s the most positive thing that we’ve seen – Extinction Rebellion, Fridays for Future. All those young people have taken to the streets, in an informed way and in a peaceful way. That’s been absolutely heartening. That gives me a sense of hope.“And again, in the last week, we’ve seen all of these demonstrations because of continued racism. Some of them have been violent. I never support violence, but a lot of people are very, very angry. When people reach that tipping point, they no longer sit in bars they take to the streets and demand their rights. We need to be demanding a right to a healthy environment and I think we’ve started to do that.” (I spoke to Packham before the Bristol protest at which the statue of Edward Colston was torn down, so this should not be taken as a comment on that, but my impression is that his heart is with the angry protesters, rather than those bemoaning the civil unrest.)\u0026nbspIn his sentiment and his delivery – quietly passionate, unabashed by what is and is not considered acceptable – Packham is very like Greta Thunberg, who often says that she thinks her Asperger’s is part of what makes her the activist she is. She is not affected by convention or “the Overton window” (the range of policies deemed politically acceptable by the mainstream), but rather tells the truth as she sees it.Packham was diagnosed with Asperger’s in 2005 and has spoken openly about it since, although he does not describe it in terms of upsides. “I struggled terribly when I was younger. Not as a young child, but later, when I was an adolescent and going in to my 20s. And my hope in speaking about it openly was that young people wouldn’t suffer in the same way. Because if they had a better understanding, and the people around them had a better understanding, life would be a lot easier. And it’s been quite heart-rending more people come up to me and talk about autism than do about natural history.”His job, though, is the same in both cases – to explain things, he says, in relatively simple ways. “I don’t mean that in a patronising way. I just mean speaking frankly and plainly.”\u0026nbspThe last time I interviewed Packham was five years ago. Back then, while powerfully exercised about animal cruelty, he was much more comfortable on the territory of other species, patiently explaining why he preferred birds to mammals (“I like feathers better than fur I think eggs are neater than placental matter I like things that fly rather than things that walk and – this is a subjective thing – they’re a more beautiful organism”). But the geopolitical intensity of the world we are in now draws him back constantly to our species. “Let’s be honest: a lot of the governments that have mishandled the corona crisis are not going to survive it. I sincerely hope that there will be a huge peaceful shake-up and people will start moving in the right direction.”While he is careful about which governments he means, he is resolute about the right direction: away from fossil fuels and flying away from careless consumption away from considering the natural world a resource to exploit. We are good at solutions, but only under pressure. “One of the stats that I’m always drawn to is that, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, in 1941, 7 December, America was producing 4m cars a year. From that point until the end of the war, they only produced 141. That’s how powerful our ability to respond to problems is. They used that capacity to produce weapons.”I am surprised by the parable – it does not feel like humanity at its finest, that, when push comes to shove, we will throw everything we have at killing each other better. But he is not a sentimentalist – whether or not we are capable of great change, we are certainly capable of huge change – and that is what the world needs.

With shows going digital this month, here are 14 that form the history of modern fashion The fashion show, as we know it, is changing, with in-real-life events replaced by a digital schedule, an enforced pause which may alter fashion forever. As the industry shifts, it’s a moment to look back as well as forward, over shows that made a mark in the modern era. From the cast of the models – which was often depressingly unerse until just a few years ago – to spectacular concepts and some really great clothes, here are 14 shows that shaped fashion over the past 25 years.Manfred Thierry Mugler exited the fashion world in 2002 but remains best known for sometimes controversial creations that\u0026nbspexaggerated\u0026nbspthe curves of the body\u0026nbspusing\u0026nbsppainstakingly crafted corsets and\u0026nbsphip-padding. He was also the master of the fashion show as spectacle, going all out with this style extravaganza at a time when other designers were moving towards minimalism.This era was peak-supermodel and the show featured Kate\u0026nbspMoss, Eva Herzigova, Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, Shalom Harlow, Karen Mulder, Claudia Schiffer, Elle Macpherson and Stella Ellis, plus-size model and Jean Paul Gaultier’s muse.\u0026nbspCameos by the likes of\u0026nbspfashion icons Jerry Hall and 60s model Veruschka, actress\u0026nbspTippi Hedren, socialite Patty Hearst and New York\u0026nbspit-girl Dianne Brill\u0026nbspwere the supporting cast.Highlights\u0026nbspincluded\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspmetal and Plexiglass cyborg bodysuit, designed in collaboration with artist Jean-Jacques Urcun and\u0026nbsplater famously shot by Helmut Newton.\u0026nbspModel Nadja Auermann\u0026nbsplooked like a Marvel superhero in a gold leather and jewelled corset designed with aircraft specialist Jean-Pierre Delcros. Simonetta Gianfelici spun in a dress inspired by Botticelli’s\u0026nbspBirth of\u0026nbspVenus (later worn by Cardi B to the 2019 Grammys). For the finale, the lights dipped to shine on\u0026nbspJames Brown\u0026nbspin front of the Mugler “Angel”\u0026nbspstarperforming\u0026nbspSex Machine.\u0026nbspThis was the fashion show as cultural moment, a world beyond the polite idustry trade event, a full hour long and broadcast live on primetime French television.\u0026nbspStaged on the grand marble steps of\u0026nbspParis’ Opéra Garnier this was one of the most\u0026nbspgrand and opulent\u0026nbspcollections Dior has ever produced.\u0026nbspThe muse was the eccentric Marchesa Casati, a woman who would parade around with a\u0026nbsppair\u0026nbspof leashed cheetahs. Each\u0026nbspmodel exuded a Casati-esque grandness, which only heightened the atmosphere.\u0026nbspThe clothes weren’t bad either. Backless velvet gowns in Art Nouveau prints, opera coats, lace sheaths, skirt-suits and wide-brimmed hats draped with flowers and tulle\u0026nbspmade the audience gasp.From the\u0026nbspfinale\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthousands of paper butterflies fluttering\u0026nbspdown\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspornate\u0026nbspceiling,\u0026nbspto the opulent curtain call of dazzling gowns\u0026nbspthat recalled the lavish balls\u0026nbspof\u0026nbspthe 20s, it was one of John Galliano’s first Dior collections, since pinpointed by fashion historians as the start of an age of theatre, excess and showmanship and a taste of what was to come from Galliano’s tenure at Dior. It all came crashing down, of course, when he was sacked by the house in 2011 after antisemitic remarks. A designer who wears his concept and high thinking on his sleeve, the construction and deconstruction of a garment is central to Margiela’s MO. If that sounds a bit academic, the designer’s shows were often visual showstoppers in their own way.\u0026nbspFor his AW98 collection ,\u0026nbspMargiela removed models completely (as he had also done for the spring collection) and replaced them with a series of lifesize puppets created by stylist Jane How. The best pieces took a plastic wrapping reminiscent of the hanging bags used to return dry cleaning. Here was another hallmark of the Belgian designer – from furniture to the humble plastic sack, he found inspiration everywhere.As anyone who saw Savage Beauty knows, McQueen’s shows were events. He turned Kate Moss into a ghostly hologram and recreated\u0026nbspthe dance marathon from Sydney Pollack’s film They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? Inspired by films and art, the designer excelled at an Instagram moment before they even existed. Collection No 13 stands out – thanks to the\u0026nbspfinale of model Shalom Harlow pirouetting on a turntable while two paint-spraying robots took aim at her strapless dress. Who knows what the shares would have been in the digital era.The start was memorable too – thanks to the casting of Paralympian and double amputee Aimee Mullins, who opened the show wearing prosthetic\u0026nbsplegs intricately carved from ash wood. For many in the\u0026nbspaudience\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspprosthetics\u0026nbspresembled boots and went unnoticed – as was the intention. Disabled models are\u0026nbspstill under represented\u0026nbspon the runway but this show was a landmark moment in challenging perceptions.Miuccia Prada has long been held up as a purveyor of “geek chic” and a woman who can turn highfalutin ideas into desirable clothes. That image was forged, in large part, by an influential SS96 collection called Banal Eccentricity, full of thrift store prints and wonky shapes, but it was this 2002 collection which introduced another fascination – sex. “I was fed up with people saying I can’t do sexy clothes!” she told Vogue.Enter sleazy raincoats, pencil skirts and cami knickers. And so began the push and pull between sexy and cerebral that marked Prada’s much-copied collections over the next two decades. The depressing thing about this moment in fashion history, however, was the whiteness of its casting – in fact, from 1993, when Naomi Campbell walked on the Prada catwalk, to 2008, when Jourdan Dunn appeared, Prada had no black models in any of its women’s runway shows.Few designers have pushed the boundaries as\u0026nbsprelentlessly\u0026nbspas\u0026nbspHussein Chalayan.\u0026nbspHis\u0026nbspgraduate collection was made from fabrics he had buried underground to oxidise\u0026nbspfor\u0026nbsptwo months.\u0026nbspThe\u0026nbspAW00\u0026nbspcollection’s\u0026nbspfinale\u0026nbspsaw a model step into a\u0026nbspwooden\u0026nbsptable, pull it up to her waist upon which\u0026nbsptelescopic rings\u0026nbspunfolded,\u0026nbsptransforming\u0026nbspinto a skirt. This 2007 show\u0026nbsplooked\u0026nbspat the iconic moments of clothing over the last 100 years,\u0026nbspas he\u0026nbspexplained:\u0026nbsp“taking\u0026nbspdifferent eras and decades and cross pollinating, borrowing elements from\u0026nbspone\u0026nbspera and using them in the next.”\u0026nbspThe highlights were six looks when models stood, centrestage and stock still, as mechanics in their dresses transformed through the ages in daring feats of engineering. One look\u0026nbspevolved from a full-length Victorian dress\u0026nbspto\u0026nbsp20s-style\u0026nbspflapper look a skirt inspired by Dior’s New Look morphed into a Paco Rabanne-esque chainmail shift dress and one dress\u0026nbspdisappeared entirely into a wide-brimmed hat. 13 years on, this remains a landmark in fashion and technology coming together with impressive results.A room with wooden floors and rows of people sitting either side of a runway doesn’t sound like much of a gamechanger when it comes to the fashion show. But this was Phoebe Philo’s debut show for Celine and announced a new point of view in fashion. While the likes of Chalayan and McQueen created events comparable to stadium concerts or art happenings, Philo was all about the clothes. It was a strategy that worked. By the time Philo left in 2017, a cohort of fans called Philophiles went into mourning. They then promptly bought up all her Celine designs on eBay.What better way for Marc Jacobs to announce his departure from Louis Vuitton than by returning to his most memorable show moments, recreated in black? The set, with its escalators, fountains and merry-go-round, was reminiscent of a deserted theme park – and a reminder of Jacobs’ incredible gift for sets and drama with elements, over 16 years including escalators to trains and Kate Moss with a cigarette.Here, French maids and butlers stood on hot pink steps at the entrance and burlesque performers showed the audience to their seats, creating a circus experience. It was matchd by the models’ heavily beaded looks and feather headdresses created by milliner Stephen Jones. Jacobs dedicated the show to the many women who influenced him during his time at the house, and signed off his programme notes “to the showgirl in all of us.”\u0026nbspRick Owens has a reputation for pushing boundaries and is no stranger to controversy – witness the penis-flashing show of\u0026nbspAW15. His womenswear SS14 show,\u0026nbspcreated a viral moment thanks to the live performance of step dancers in place of models. Stepping evolved in African-American colleges as a hybrid of step dancing, cheerleading and military drill. Owens worked with choreographers LeeAnet Noble and Lauretta Malloy Noble for the show after finding them on Youtube, and the\u0026nbspclothes were created for each dancer and cut to accommodate movement. Classical\u0026nbsptunics, togas, armour and sports kits provided the inspiration. Noble told Into the Gloss: “The idea was to bring stepping – something that has roots at colleges and in the streets – to a new level of high art”.\u0026nbspJust six years ago the catwalks looked even thinner and whiter than they do now so casting mostly women of colour across a mix of body types was, dispiritingly, unprecedented.\u0026nbspThe show provoked\u0026nbspmixed reactions.\u0026nbspSome dancers and people of colour found Owens’ instructions to make what one dancer called “screw faces” as conforming to an angry black woman stereotype. For some, it didn’t help that the show was called ‘Vicious’. “We are not attractive to him, but a schtick for amusement,” wrote one Fashionista commentator.\u0026nbspOthers appreciated a more erse idea of what a fashion show can be.\u0026nbsp“Team Vicious\u0026nbspjolted the industry with its ethnicity, voluptuous figures and personality. The performers rose up against everything that so often makes the fashion world feel like an inhospitable place to so many women… Months later, the look of some of the most high profile women’s ready-to-wear shows – from Paris to New York – was more erse. Just a little,” Robin Givhan wrote in the\u0026nbspWashington Post.\u0026nbspKarl Lagerfeld’s time at Chanel played host to some of\u0026nbspthe most elaborate sets ever seen at fashion week: an aeroplane, an iceberg, even a rocket, all full size, were built\u0026nbspinside Paris’s Grand Palais. But it was the Chanel supermarket that is still the most talked about. A full-sized hypermarche stocked with actual fresh produce and Chanel-branded products, from cereal (CoCo Chanel Coco Pops) to cleaning products emblazoned with the double C logo.Fashion editors and celebrities posed for selfies next to the Chanel fromage counter. Rihanna pushed Cara Delevingne in a trolley for the post-show press call. Perhaps the most\u0026nbspmemorable part was the least chic: the stampede\u0026nbspto snag a souvenir at the end, as fashion editors sharpened\u0026nbspelbows to bag the much prized “Mademoiselle Privee” doormat. Most were removed by security before the exit but a few were smuggled\u0026nbsphome on the Eurostar.While Kanye West’s toe-dipping into fashion goes back to 2011, when he launched his own line in Paris, it’s been Yeezy (a collaboration with Adidas) where his impact has been most effective. For Yeezy season 1, he worked with Vanessa Beecroft – a frequent collaborator on his music videos – on the choreography, cast a erse range of non-models for the show, debuted the track Wolves and the Yeezy Boosts all at the same time.Beecroft’s contribution to Yeezy has since ended thanks to problematic remarks around race, but this 360-degree look at a fashion show, as experience first, clothes second, has became increasingly common in the past five years. West’s Yeezy shows – now on season 7 – are part of that. How they negotiate digital will be interesting to see.Donatella Versace\u0026nbspmarked the\u0026nbsp20th\u0026nbspanniversary of the murder of\u0026nbspher brother\u0026nbspGianni with the Tribute collection. She produced a show that paid homage to the spirit of Gianni’s 90s runways – with a very modern sense of fun,\u0026nbspas well as sex and glamour.\u0026nbsp It was the finale that broke the internet. A curtain pulled back to reveal five of the\u0026nbsporiginal\u0026nbspsupermodels –\u0026nbspCindy\u0026nbspCrawford, Helena Christensen, Claudia Shiffer, Carla Bruni and Naomi Campbell –\u0026nbspwho then joined arms and walked the runway to George Michael’s Freedom, as some of them had done at the finale of the\u0026nbsp1991 show. A moment built on a moment to make another moment in the Versace timeline.Christopher Bailey’s final collection for Burberry after 17 years at the helm was one of outright celebration and pride, with a focus on LGBTQ+ young people. The collection, entitled Time, was Bailey’s way of showing “the past, present, and future” of Burberry. “My final collection here at Burberry is dedicated to – and in support of – some of the best and brightest organisations supporting LGBT+ youth around the world,” said Bailey who remixed the house\u0026nbspcheck\u0026nbspto include a Pride rainbow. Burberry also made a sizeable donation to\u0026nbspthe Albert Kennedy Trust, the Trevor Project and ILGA in support of\u0026nbspLGBTQ+ causes.The collection\u0026nbspfocused on the 80s, the era in which Bailey grew up, with models walking to a soundtrack of the era’s pop-soul while wearing reissued pieces from the decade. The rainbow flag was there from start to finish from the reinvented check, to the cloak worn by Cara Delevingne, to the laser-light finale. A show of hope, happiness and inclusivity, it was the perfect show for Bailey to wave farewell to the house – and a tenure during which he had introduced digital revolution to the heritage house, and made the Burberry trenchcoat an aspiration for a new generation.Named Sister, Pyer Moss SS20 was the much-anticipated final chapter in the brand’s American, Also trilogy – Kerby Jean-Raymond’s three-part series of collections which confront the eradication of African-American narratives in popular culture.This collection, Raymond’s first after winning Vogue’s Fashion Fund award, paid homage to Sister Rosetta Tharpe, the queer, black musical trailblazer credited with laying the foundations of rock ’n’ roll, and influencing the likes of Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley. Centre stage was the 90-strong Tabernacle Drip Choir singing songs by black artists from Donny Hathaway to Missy Elliot and Cardi B.The clothes celebrated black excellence, and some featured images of the guitar in direct tribute to Tharpe. They were Raymond’s vision of rock-star style – at a time when freedom of expression has never been more important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/421fd2717aec8baf5068cafb107f52e9050e7661/466_0_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34a2685e142fb68445d8e675dc03848d","title":"the fanatic review john travolta stalker limp bizkit fred durst","story":"Travolta plays an isolated obsessive who tracks down his movie hero in this nasty drama, directed by former Limp Bizkit frontman Fred DurstThis marks yet another rung down on John Travolta’s ladder of career ignominy after his most recent flops, Gotti and Speed Kills. It’s a grotesque drama in which Travolta plays a disturbed fan. It would be risible if it weren’t so offensive, mean-spirited and, frankly, nasty. Sporting a pudding-bowl haircut, too-small bike helmet and an deploying overdone shuffling gait, Travolta stars as Moose, an isolated obsessive living on the fringes of Los Angeles’ celebrity culture. At night, he busks for a living on Hollywood Boulevard – in costume as a British bobby (complete with Dick Van Dyke-style mockney accent). The aim is to get enough scratch to fund his collection of movie memorabilia, a good chunk of which is devoted to his hero, one-time C-list action star Hunter Dunbar (Devon Sawa). When Moose’s only friend, paparazza Leah (Ana Golja) ill-advisedly shows Moose how to find out where Dunbar lives using a star-map phone app, she enables a serious bout of stalking that goes wrong.On the surface, that all might make this sound like a ho-hum variant on the well-trodden crazed-stan genre that encompasses works both pulpy (like The Fan) and potent (Misery, The King of Comedy). Former Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, who writes and directs here, apparently was inspired by his own experience of being stalked by an admirer, which maybe accounts for the atmosphere of narcissistic self pity. But what really makes this film contemptible is Travolta’s deployment of classically autistic behaviours to portray Moose, a display made all the more sinister given its skill. But given the trajectory of the story, it’s as if we are meant to infer that Moose deserves to be punished for his condition. On top of all that, there’s a sprinkling of misogyny, faint racism and class snobbery that makes this an unpleasant watch any way you slice it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/834d12d3871fec1505231f60179a2e38c8942f7a/520_318_4664_2799/master/4664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9dfb65e5a37a64d8234c0d78c47cfe4","title":"us soccer repeals anthem kneeling rule","story":"US Soccer’s board of directors has voted to repeal a 2017 policy that required national team players to stand during the national anthem, a rule adopted after Megan Rapinoe kneeled in support of Colin Kaepernick.The board made the decision during a conference call, US Soccer announced Wednesday.Policy 604-1 states: “All persons representing a Federation national team shall stand respectfully during the playing of national anthems at any event in which the Federation is represented.” The board passed the rule on 9 February 2017.A person with knowledge of the discussions regarding the policy said new president Cindy Parlow Cone first broached repealing the rule last week, calling for the special meeting of the board. The person asked to remain anonymous because the process was not made public. Three players were invited on the call to share their opinions.“We have not done enough to listen – especially to our players – to understand and acknowledge the very real and meaningful experiences of Black and other minority communities in our country. We apologize to our players – especially our Black players – staff, fans, and all who support eradicating racism,” US Soccer said in a statement Wednesday. “Sports are a powerful platform for good, and we have not used our platform as effectively as we should have. We can do more on these specific issues and we will.”The US Soccer Athletes’ Council, which includes current national team players Alex Morgan and Ali Krieger, as well as former players like Landon Donovan, called on US Soccer to also apologize for the policy to foster a “positive relationship to exist going forward”.“Then and only then do we feel a new chapter between the USSF and its athletes can begin. Additionally, we urge US Soccer to develop a plan with action items focused on anti-racism that will be shared publicly with its athletes, key stakeholders, and fans,” the council said in a statement earlier this week.The US Women’s National Team Players Association also called for an apology from US Soccer and a plan to substantively address racial inequality.“Until USSF does so, the mere existence of the policy will continue to perpetuate the misconceptions and fear that clouded the true meaning and significance of Colin Kaepernick, Megan Rapinoe and other athletes taking a knee – that Black people in America have not been and continue to not be afforded the same liberties and freedoms as white people and that police brutality and systemic racism exist in this country,” the players said in a statement.Rapinoe took a knee during the anthem at a pair of national team matches in 2016. She said she wanted to express solidarity with Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who silently took a knee during the national anthem before NFL games to raise awareness of police brutality and racial injustice.Kaepernick and Rapinoe faced sharp criticism for the protest for years. But sentiment among the public has changed since George Floyd’s death last month and the subsequent protests.Floyd, a black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aed2d062183cdc085f7f909d0f7d8022c4f39cd5/0_18_1860_1116/master/1860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba1127694c26a996a511678a7bfd55e3","title":"liverpool need to rebuild but werner may turn out to be a great non signing","story":"Jürgen Klopp’s squad is due for a period of renewal but the time was not right to sign the RB Leipzig attackerLook out. Here comes everybody! Or at least, here come Kylian Mbappé, Ferran Torres, Ousmane Dembélé, Kalidou Koulibaly, Adama Traoré, Leroy Sané, Diego Carlos, Wout Weghorst, Talles Magno, Tanguy Ndombele, Thomas Partey, Bukayo Saka and Eduardo Camavinga. Time for a paragraph break?And we go again, with Aster Vranckx, Nicolò Zaniolo, Dominik Szoboszlai, Victor Osimhen, Boubakary Soumaré, Willian, Philippe Coutinho, Marcelo Brozovic, Milot Rashica, Kostas Tsimikas, Marcus Thuram, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho.What do these footballers have in common? All of them have been “linked with” a move to Liverpool. Even better, all of them have been linked with a move to Liverpool in the last two months, a list of suggested transactions that bears repeating only because it is so absurd. We can only hope for the sake of his own sleep patterns that Jürgen Klopp has turned off that Google alert on his phone.There are of course significant caveats to this red-shirted shadow army. “Linked with” is weak gruel at the best of times, shorthand for hopeful agents and arm’s-length bluff. And of course lockdown does funny things to all of us. Right now there is an empty space where football should be, tended by an industry that still needs to produce content.But there is also an edge of reality buried beneath the mound of bodies, a shiver of anxiety as Liverpool’s final step towards the league title looms closer. This is driven in part by the question of what comes next. Something is happening here. But what exactly?The most recent near-miss isn’t on that list. This is of course Timo Werner, who may or may not reach an agreement with Chelsea this week, but who has already become a very public Liverpool non-signing. It is an interesting move in itself, failure to recruit a player presented by Klopp as an act rather than an omission, as a positive choice, another part of a commercially-sound team-building strategy.At £53m Werner was simply the right man in the wrong moment of total economic collapse. Such is the level of trust in Klopp and the club’s owners that this seems pretty reasonable. Footballing lore insists that great teams always build from a position of strength: a line that tends to overlook the wider truth that, weak or strong, in football you always need to be building, that even the finest teams exist in a state of constant disintegration.It is this point that some supporters feel most keenly. Liverpool are champions of Europe. Liverpool spent the first six months of the season marching the rest of the field around the Premier League in a headlock. Liverpool have the most resourceful elite-level manager in the world.And yet, there is also an acceptance that a team built on coaching and chemistry is in need of some urgent refreshing. Werner is a high-class player. His arrival would have reflected the success of recent methods, where large amounts have been spent, but on the right players in just the right spot.There is still time. A high-class central defender and a versatile attacker (plenty on that shadow list) are still wanted. But teams are also fragile things. Time is passing. How often do these moments come around, when every element of an organisation aligns on the same course, when a wider generational success can be seen bedding into place?And how often does such a moment coincide with a wider economic collapse and a four-month pause in the workings of everyday life? Liverpool have, above all, been terribly unlucky with timing.This misfortune applies to the recruitment cycle. The significant period of evolution for the current team was between summer 2017 and summer 2018. During that year Alisson, Fabinho, Andy Robertson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah all arrived, while Trent Alexander-Arnold emerged as a first-team player.It has been a brilliant spell of team building. But by the time football returns it will be two years since Liverpool signed a significant player and 12 regular first-team squad members will be 28 or older. Alexander-Arnold is the only young player in the first XI. A period of renewal is due. Klopp knows this better than anyone. It was clearly coming this summer.At which point: enter one global meltdown. The plans hatched to manage this will have been based on a previous version of reality, one in which it made sense to pay large amounts for a single high-class addition, and where commercial and TV income seemed guaranteed in perpetuity.These are fragile margins, too. To reach this stage, to win the Champions League while also achieving record profits, is a wonderful achievement. But it doesn’t have to be like this. Success is a brittle thing. Imagine throwing a broken season plus total business model collapse into the workings of Manchester United 1992, Chelsea 2004 or Barcelona 2005. Success would still come. But earthquakes hardly help, not least ones that seem geared to attack specifically your own points of strength.On the pitch the current Liverpool is built around extreme physicality and beautifully-grooved team chemistry, all of which have been interrupted. It is also a style built with the home crowd in mind, a way of playing that feeds on shared energy. Liverpool haven’t lost a significant domestic match at Anfield in over two years. This is all part of the design, formulated within parameters that have now disappeared. Same for everyone. But how many others had cracked it to this degree?The commercial landscape has also changed. Liverpool became the best club team on the planet by playing the existing rules perfectly. Klopp and Fenway Sports Group have been kings of the FFP era, obeying the rules of engagement and exploiting their own resources better than anyone else at that level in Europe.Well, say goodbye to all that. It is fairly clear that financial fair play will be given minimal policing from here as football looks to rake in every penny it can. A club like Chelsea is suddenly back in that position of power, with access to a bottomless set of pockets, and prepared to spend speculatively.The game has changed. Will Liverpool change with it?Not so far, and rightly so. Be true to thine own self: the most Klopp-era thing Liverpool could have done at a time of falling revenues, pay cuts and social ision was to walk away from a £200,000-a-week new signing.There will no doubt be money to spend. But success to date has arrived hand in hand with being able to read the room, and in this case the commercial management has once again followed its instincts. Who knows, in time Werner-to-Liverpool might turn out to be one of the great non-signings, an era-defining non-signing.

Having looked in danger of being dragged into a relegation dogfight after some indifferent performances in January and most of February, beating Newcastle at home before the win at the Amex Stadium against rivals Brighton ensured Palace should already have enough of a cushion over the bottom three. Only Norwich have scored fewer goals but with nine clean sheets and only 32 conceded, solidity is the hallmark of Hodgson’s team.What about now? After facing Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium on 20 June – which will be the first Premier League match to be broadcast on terrestrial television – Palace face a daunting run of fixtures that will see them meet only one more side not presently in the top half of the table. They still have to travel to Liverpool, Leicester and Wolves, not to mention home fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham on the final day which may put paid to their chances of surpassing 2014-15’s 10th place – the club’s highest Premier League finish. At least Hodgson will have a full squad to choose from as he attempts to navigate the choppy waters. Even Mamadou Sakho has been back in training having missed the majority of the season because of injury. The France defender is one of Palace’s highest earners and has only a year left on his contract at Selhurst Park with the Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, saying he “has the right personality” after being linked with a move to the Ligue 1 club a few weeks ago.What needs to be done to have a successful end to the season? Palace supporters have been starved of excitement in their home matches all season having seen their team score only 12 goals in 15 matches but with such a tricky run-in it is hard to see that tally increasing much. The superb form of Ayew has made up for Wilfried Zaha’s least effective season for some time, although the Ivory Coast forward remains Palace’s most potent attacking threat. Finding an effective combination with Christian Benteke remains the biggest challenge for their 72-year-old manager, who signed a new one-year contract the day before the win against Watford on 7 March. \u0026nbspHave players and staff behaved during lockdown? There were no indiscretions by any of Palace’s squad with several players praising the club’s efforts to keep them informed before they returned to training. Staff also made efforts to check on more than 1,000 supporters over the age of 70 to see if they could provide any assistance, including going shopping for some season ticket holders.

Zaha and his business partner Obi Williams have provided free accommodation for 50 NHS workers during the pandemic through their company Zo Properties, while the entire squad contributed a significant donation to Age UK Croydon and Selhurst Park was used as a refreshment base for ambulance workers. Chefs made more 6,000 meals for NHS staff and vulnerable people, while the Palace for Life foundation took its mentoring initiatives for disadvantaged young people in south London online in an attempt to ease the mental health challenges of lockdown. Patrick van Aanholt, meanwhile, took on Twitter troll Katie Hopkins after she dismissed the Black Lives Matter movement and told the Dutchman to “kneel and kiss her ring”. “As for your ring you are welcome to come to Selhurst and kiss my big toe ... I’ll wait,” he responded.Key player in the run-in? Two years since he joined from Getafe on a free transfer, Vicente Guaita has firmly established himself as Palace’s No 1 thanks to some brilliant performances this season. That the Spaniard’s only big mistake in 28 matches so far came in the defeat to Sheffield United in February is testament to his ability, with boyhood club Valencia reported to be interested in bringing him home this summer. The 33-year-old looks equipped to play at the highest level and will certainly have plenty of opportunities to shine against some of the Premier League’s best attacks over the next few weeks.End-of-season-prediction 12th. Points will be hard to come by but beating last season’s mark of 49 – Palace’s highest in the Premier League – could be attainable if they can continue where they left off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/960d945674f958793859075c50e0ee4ae98becaf/59_387_3464_2078/master/3464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0ea8112be91ae10aae73867546d27f4","title":"online parties no parades how to mark promotion during covid 19","story":"Coventry and Rotherham are going up but EFL clubs are facing massive challenges over the summer and beyond“There was one Rotherham fan in the car park, so I tooted at them and waved. I thought: ‘Wow, I could be the manager of Tickhill, where I live, and I’d probably get more people wave at me when I get promotion,’” Paul Warne says. He is reflecting on the muted celebrations when he arrived at the stadium following confirmation his Rotherham team had finished as runners-up to Coventry in League One, after the regular season was curtailed owing to coronavirus. Happiness is inevitably tinged with hollowness given the circumstances.Warne spent Wednesday afternoon delivering gifts, including crates of beer, to his backroom staff after a celebratory video call on Tuesday, when he gave a “Churchillian speech” to his players. “I’m a real hugger and a shaker, and I can’t do any of that so I’m finding distancing very difficult,” he says.Coventry had to make do with an online party instead of an open-top bus parade, and players and staff enjoyed a glass of champagne at their training ground where the manager, Mark Robins, spent the afternoon pacing around the chief executive’s office awaiting confirmation they had been crowned champions.Robins returned in March 2017, the month before relegation to League Two, and has overseen two promotions in three seasons on a modest budget. And then there is the maddening reality that Coventry, who ground-shared with Northampton in 2013-14, have been playing home matches 22 miles away from the city in Birmingham since August.But not everyone is happy. Peterborough, bumped out of the play-offs on a points-per-game system, were left reeling, with their co-owner, Darragh MacAnthony, describing the protracted saga as a “shit show”. Next season, he says, his staff will return hellbent on promotion in readiness for the “Vengeance Tour”.Tranmere, understandably, feel particularly hard done by and say they are preparing for a £1m drop in income and that staff will lose jobs as a result of being relegated after a majority of 18 teams voted to curtail the season. They had 10 games remaining and, for the context of how cruel relegation is, it is worth considering AFC Wimbledon, Rochdale and Oxford survived having been in the bottom four with nine games to play last seasonIn League Two Macclesfield are in limbo as they await an independent hearing, expected this month, over the non-payment of wages and their players have accused the EFL of “trying their best to throw” them out of the Football League. Macclesfield have been docked 11 points this season for a series of off-field misdemeanours and hover three points above the bottom club, Stevenage, who naturally hope things go their way. The EFL said relegation would be implemented only if the National League provides assurances it will start the 2020-21 season.The financial reward of promotion probably means more this season, Warne says, because it helps shield jobs and livelihoods at Rotherham amid the coronavirus crisis. “It is a massive relief for me,” the manager says. “It doesn’t feel like someone is sitting on my chest any more.”Many teams furloughed staff following news of curtailment and Rick Parry, the EFL chairman, has acknowledged the challenges facing clubs has not diminished. “The aim is to make sure all the clubs survive,” he said.“It\u0026nbspwouldn’t surprise me if a few stadiums were locked up and never opened again,” says Warne, a former Rotherham, Oldham and Yeovil midfielder. “I hope that isn’t the case but unfortunately the staff at clubs are always the first to go.“When teams fall out of the Championship, it is always peripheral coaching staff that are first to go – Nigel Clough fell on his sword recently. Some teams might go from two masseurs, two physios and two sports scientists to all of sudden just having one of each. It’s the same on the media side and people in the club shop. It hits a lot of people. There will be tough decisions for a lot of people in the next weeks and months.”Managers are anticipating a different landscape many expect to operate with smaller squads and lean on their academy or under-23s to supplement their options. Some clubs will be desperate to get high-earning players off the wage bill as soon as the transfer window reopens, while others may be lucky enough to be in a position to take advantage of such scenarios.“I think it will be a bit of a forest fire and maybe football will come out a little bit healthier in the long run,” Warne says. “In the moment, talking about people’s jobs, it’s not kind to talk about things being healthier, but I do expect change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4449164b15159b04d09d6f0159208ab6a663dd0d/0_126_5600_3360/master/5600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b677d549b28f7372242702ab04131a96","title":"from promotions to gift cards how a great website keeps customers coming back again and again","story":"Customer loyalty is something companies crave, but how do they make it happen? Smartphone shopping, augmented-reality changing rooms, same-day delivery (perhaps soon by drone) – with so much innovative e-commerce out there, you would think that small and micro businesses were tooled to the hilt with technology. In reality, nearly half of UK small businesses lack even the most basic of 21st-century gizmos: a website.In recent months, consumer spending has dropped significantly because of Covid-19, but where money is being spent, it is likely to be through online purchases, so a website is more essential than ever if a business is to thrive. In fact, a survey for the website builder GoDaddy found that lockdown has prompted a fifth of micro businesses to set up an online presence for the first time, while nearly half of such businesses have boosted their digital and social media activity.Some savvy small businesses are tapping into this trend by using their websites to create additional opportunities for consumers to spend. Online promotions, reward schemes and e-gift cards are just some of the ways businesses can help keep customers returning.Promotions (vouchers, discounts and deals) are a great way to attract new customers and keep them coming back for more, as are contests, giveaways and flash sales. Meanwhile, free deliveries and automatic replenishment of perishables using a subscription model have become increasingly popular in the e-commerce world. Placing time limits on deals can create a sense of urgency and encourage uptake.Another way to spur bigger purchases is to create product or service bundles, or to cross-sell complementary items. Multi-buy deals – such as three for two – can result in a larger shopping basket too. And what about the customer who leaves your website without purchasing the items in their cart? A reminder email might entice them back.But be warned about heavy discounting, if it’s not done properly, businesses can end up reducing the perceived value of their products or services.Ultimately, it’s crucial to benchmark the results of any promotion against your regular pricing to see which strategy has the most positive impact on the top line.For small businesses, the prospect of running promotions can seem daunting, but it doesn’t need to be if you know where to look. GoDaddy has created a suite of email marketing tools specifically designed with small businesses in mind. These tools let clients quickly and easily send out notifications about promotions, and even automate them to lighten the load.And to help you get to know your customers better – who they are and what resonates with them – GoDaddy makes it simple for its clients to create surveys and monitor the results. All of which will help you run your business in a way that bolsters your bottom line.Reward schemes differ from online promotions in that they encourage repeat purchases over an extended period.The added benefit is that your business can gather data on consumer behaviour and satisfaction, so you can tailor products or services to their needs. Your customers may also spread the word about your loyalty scheme and encourage others to join.For customers, there are many benefits – saving money and time, winning prizes, and early access to products, services or events. Communicating the advantages of a scheme is one of the keys to its success.Typically, customers earn “points” when they buy from you, refer friends or post about your business on social media. You can also award points for anniversaries and business milestones.Shoppers can be automatically enrolled when they make their first purchase, or can opt in via your app, website or social media channels. Customers then redeem their points to get products free or at a discount.Remember to take time periodically reviewing the performance of the programme. You can choose which metrics you measure – whether it’s number of members, or rewards earned or claimed – but it’s important to understand what worked well, what didn’t, and how to improve the programme.Digital gift cards could be the ultimate guarantor of customer loyalty during the pandemic. They’re not just a source of immediate income, they are an endorsement of your business from the giver and a warranty that you’ll gain a future customer. What’s more, they are a relatively cheap marketing tool that spreads awareness of your brand.Some businesses combine e-gift cards with promotions offering future discounts, which they hope will encourage recipients of e-gift cards to return and spend more.This makes sense as the cost of acquiring new customers can be far higher than retaining existing customers. And those existing customers are much more likely to try out new products and to spend more as their trust grows. This underscores the importance of a loyalty scheme for small businesses.Developments in technology might be moving at a rate of knots, but small businesses needn’t be left behind. Beyond the bells and whistles of drones and augmented reality, there is a world of opportunity for entrepreneurs. And it all begins with a website.GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at\u0026nbspOpenWeStand.org\u0026nbspto help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed. Over 50 companies have joined the cause, including Slack, Salesforce, PayPal, and more"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68967ac24fde2a7643c6fc82b4c5ef5549c2301d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=455a663cd450e16235ca102c9a018b92","title":"weddings cancel end","story":"Starting your life together with a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism is a relic of a bygone time – let’s leave it thereNone of us are going to be going to weddings anytime soon. In many states and cities, what we see as traditional weddings, with large gatherings of people, have been banned. We are living through a period defined by its disappointments, by concert debuts that will not happen, by plays that will not launch, by aborted careers and, yes, by grand wedding dreams that will never reach fulfillment.The disappointments of missed weddings are no doubt painful. But the truth is that a re-evaluation of the contemporary wedding was already well overdue.In 2019, the wedding industry is, or rather was, worth $70bn, and that’s in the United States alone, and that doesn’t include honeymoons. It was pure madness. Many industries are going to have be be reconsidered in the wake of the economic shutdown, and weddings should be at the top of the list. Like the cruise industry, we should just let it die.\u0026nbspHalf a century ago, marriage meant big life changes:\u0026nbsplosing your virginity,\u0026nbspmoving in, merging bank accounts, having kids. But now, three-quarters of couples already live together. They split the bills. They share a bed. Marriage is not a requirement to be an adult any more.\u0026nbspNonetheless, we maintain these supposedly necessary traditions. The most widespread collective response to the approach of gender equality has been that, in our most significant public declarations of love and commitment, women dress up like they’re minor members of the Russian royal family from the 19th century and men dress up like they’re waiters on cruise liners. I guess it’s good to begin any major phase in life with a consciousness of your own ridiculousness, but surely there ought to be limits.And then there is the cost. The average cost of a wedding in 2019 was $32,329. The median cost for a house in the States that year was $200,000, according to Zillow. Do the math: the average cost of a wedding is a serious downpayment on an average house. You start off the period of your life when you really need money by collecting it in a pile and burning it. A big wedding makes leasing a sports car look like a good financial decision.Spending all that money on a wedding won’t make you happier, it won’t make your marriage stronger. The opposite, in fact. In 2015, social scientists in Singapore did the work. In ‘A Diamond is Forever’ and Other Fairy Tales: The Relationship between Wedding Expenses and Marriage Duration,\u0026nbspthey found marriage duration is inversely associated with the spending on the ceremony and the engagement ring. The more you spend, the shorter the marriage lasts. But that’s obvious any time you go to a wedding. You can tell how unhappy a couple is by the size of the flower arrangements.\u0026nbsp(For the record, my wife and I eloped in the aftermath of September 11. We were, according to lifestyle journalists at the time, a “terror marriage”.)\u0026nbspThe idea that you need to have the big wedding because of “tradition”? The “tradition” behind weddings was all thought up by Madison Avenue types a hundred years ago. Karen Dunak, a history professor at Muskingum University in Ohio, wrote As Long as We Both Shall Love: The White Wedding in Postwar America. It’s a fascinating history of the consumerist nonsense that is the modern wedding. “When you have this rise and this increased democratization of a consumer culture in the 1920s, this is when you have more wedding registries this is when you have department stores that would have wedding departments,” she told me. “This is when you have the commercialization of a lot of services related to the wedding. That you would have bakers who make wedding cakes, you would have wedding boutiques, you would have florists who would make wedding arrangements rather than people doing it as a part of home craft.”The tradition of huge elaborate ceremonies followed by enormous parties, all at vast expense, belongs to the recent past of unparalleled growth. That period is over. It’s time to make some new traditions – vastly, vastly cheaper ones.Before Covid-19, a wedding was a way to begin your life together in a splurge of debt and wasteful narcissism. That is what a pre-Covid wedding forced you to do: it forced you to turn your love into a lifestyle. It forced you to turn your private life into a big display. There was enormous social pressure to engage in what is obviously a folly: to begin adulthood by lying, by making up fraudulent histories, by pretending that you’re independent, by grotesque and unoriginal conspicuous consumption.\u0026nbspCovid-19 is ruining a great many beautiful things, glorious art, wonderful meetings, even love itself. But this destruction – the destruction of the wedding industry –\u0026nbspwe should take for what it is, a blessing in disguise. Let’s not let the insanity back. We should keep weddings right where they are, right now: nowhere.\u0026nbspStephen Marche’s audio series How Not to F*ck Up Your Marriage Too Bad is available on Audible June 11"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d05b625877df0b11425e57b658ce7c44a38d23b5/0_356_4664_2797/master/4664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b11e5e17fef90487662d08516a53b32","title":"living in england are you planning to move out of a city","story":"We would like to hear from people who are relocating outside cities due to the coronavirus pandemicWith estate agents in England allowed to conduct viewings via video or appointments where people are physical distancing, some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid a rise in home working.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving away from an urban area we want to hear from you.What are your reasons for moving out of the city?

If you’re one of Spotify’s 286 million monthly users, you’ve probably noticed an icon on your mobile app that looks like a computer monitor behind a speaker – that’s your portal to Spotify Connect, a super-simple way to play music on all your home tech devices, from your smart fridge to your laptop. But how does it work – and how does it stack up against other wireless streaming methods?Since 2018, Spotify Connect has been available for all users, however to be able to connect to every compatible device out there, you’ll need a Spotify Premium subscription. You can use it on your tablet, phone or computer as a kind of remote control to play what you want, where you want it – Spotify offers podcasts in addition to its extensive library of music. And unlike using a Bluetooth speaker, the music won’t stop if you receive a call.Using Spotify Connect is really easy. From the mobile app, choose something to play, then tap “devices available” underneath the song name. Next, tap the icon of a screen and a speaker, and you’ll get a list of all the Connect-compatible smart devices on your home network. You don’t have to add them, they appear automatically if they’re connected to wifi.The process on a computer is pretty similar: play something, then click the icon of a screen and a speaker in the bottom right of the app and choose your preferred device.There’s a vast range of compatible gadgets, so chances are that the device you want to play music on is on the list, but you can check here just in case.Once you’re streaming, you can use your phone or computer as normal: the audio comes directly from Spotify, not your device, so you can take calls and keep the music going. It doesn’t run your battery down, either.Moving the sound around is really straightforward: just tap a different device on the list and the music instantly continues there. This is especially handy when you’re moving rooms, or you need to switch away from the soundbar because someone wants to watch TV, for instance.And when it’s party time (after the pandemic, we might add!), use Spotify Connect to start a group session so that everyone can contribute to the playlist – another feature you can’t get with just Bluetooth or wifi. You’ll see the option to “Start a group session” at the bottom of your Spotify Connect device list, which gives you a code to share with friends so they can add their favourites.Bluetooth is an easy, near-universal wireless method of connecting one smart thing to another. That connection is called “pairing” and is usually simple to do – for instance, on many speakers, there’s a little button with the Bluetooth symbol (a stylised B that looks like a sideways pair of scissors) that you press to start sending out signals. Then, turn on Bluetooth via your phone, or whichever device you’re trying to connect to, scan for nearby Bluetooth gadgets and select your speaker from the list. The instructions vary slightly by device, so check the help files for yours if you’re stuck.Pairing is usually straightforward and only has to be done once – from then on it should work automatically. But Bluetooth does have its downsides too, the more distance there is between the music device and the speaker, the more chance there is for interference and sound drop out – something you don’t need to worry about with Spotify Connect. Thick walls can really mess up the connection too, as you’ll notice if you wander around the house with wireless headphones on.Bluetooth is the best choice for listening to music outside your home, because you can use it for portable speakers, car stereos and so on without needing to be close to a power socket or wifi router. However, it’s a real drain on the battery life of whatever device you’re streaming from.The connection can also be temperamental, varying on some devices more than others. If one of the gadgets you like to listen on often drops out, it’s worth trying a different method.Most devices that can play music, such as speakers, TVs, games consoles and even smartwatches have an app that helps you connect them to your home wifi network, and from there you can link up your streaming source.For instance, a smart speaker such as Google Home gets connected to wifi during setup, using its app. Once it’s ready, you just open the app settings and choose your preferred service for streaming music and podcasts, then start issuing voice commands – such as “OK Google, play Spotify”.The benefit of using wifi rather than Bluetooth is that you don’t have to worry about keeping your devices close together. As long as whatever’s playing the music is connected to wifi, you’re good – and you can use your phone for calls without cutting off the tunes.Spotify Connect runs on wifi, so you’ll see all these benefits, plus the added bonus that it will automatically seek out and connect with compatible devices. So if you are going to connect over wifi, it makes sense to do it via Spotify Connect.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

McIlroy cited his own idolisation of Tiger Woods as a reason why skin colour shouldn’t lead to the placement of barriers.After a three-month absence triggered by coronavirus, the PGA Tour will restart with the Charles Schwab Challenge in Texas. It is the death of Floyd, rather than the pandemic, which feels most prominent on the landscape after demonstrations on both sides of the Atlantic. The Tour has initiated a moment of silence each day in Floyd’s memory and left the 8.46 tee time free, in reference to the period he was pinned to the ground by a policeman in Minneapolis.“A great word that I’ve sort of been thinking of over the last couple of weeks is ‘tolerance,’” said McIlroy. “I think everyone can just be a little more tolerant, and a little more educated and not as ignorant.“My hero growing up was Tiger Woods. Tiger doesn’t look the same as me, has had a very different upbringing to the one that I have had, but he was my hero growing up, and it didn’t matter what colour his skin was, what his beliefs were. Tiger was my hero, and he’s been a lot of kids’ heroes over the years that have grown up playing golf. We’ve been very lucky to have him in our game. I think that there should be more people like him in golf.”McIlroy was struck by a conversation, filmed in recent days, between Harold Varner and the PGA Tour’s commissioner Jay Monahan. Varner is one of a tiny number of black PGA Tour members. “These issues I think really hit home with me,” McIlroy explained. “Harold said, it maybe just isn’t about the players, it’s about everyone in the game of golf. There’s so many people that are involved with the game, and as long as we continue to give people from different backgrounds opportunities to be in golf, that can only be a good thing.”Woods called last week for a “safer, unified society” on account of the “shocking tragedy” of Floyd. The 15-times major winner is not in the Charles Schwab field but speculation suggests he may feature next week when the PGA Tour reaches South Carolina.McIlroy, who reiterated his belief that a world circuit in golf would be beneficial, praised the PGA Tour for “robust” Covid-19 procedures. “It has felt very safe,” said the Northern Irishman. “Everyone is doing the right things, and the people that are involved with the tournament are wearing masks and wearing gloves and there’s sanitiser everywhere you look. It feels safe. I feel safe, and I would say basically everyone else that’s here feels the same way.“I think it’s an important week because golf can show that we can play in a socially distant manner. We can conduct a tournament and adhere to all the safety protocols that have been put in place.“It is going to be very easy to fall back into old habits because it’s just what we’ve done.

A software error in the company’s app had led to patients being presented with recordings of other users’ consultations with their doctors. At least three patients were affected, the company said, and none of them had viewed the videos.Speaking at the virtual CogX festival, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was unaware of the data breach, but that it did not affect his views on the value of private partnerships within the NHS. “What I care about is getting results,” Hancock said,\u0026nbsp“when companies will come and help in the middle of a pandemic.

But it can’t serve that role and act as the long arm of the Chinese government,” said the group’s CEO, Suzanne Nossel.With its alluring market, China has long been problematic for US tech giants that generally boast of allowing unfettered free speech at home.Apple in 2017 acknowledged that it bowed to Chinese law by removing apps for VPNs, or virtual private networks, that let its users evade local controls."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ed93343eceb39068a4ff051743a66cafbecfa66/0_414_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acd25415be1dafc8d83dd30846ed8c0d","title":"dreams of italy readers travel tips","story":"A friendly football bar, the ‘real’ sword in the stone, plus walks, festivals and food to die for ... you responded in droves to our request for Italian highlights For an unforgettable day away from the bustle of Rome, walk part of the Via Appia Antica, among the oldest paved roads in the world. For a demanding but amazing hike, walk 11 miles from the historic Quo Vadis church (on the 118 bus route) to Castel Gandolfo, overlooking a volcanic lake and home to the Pope’s summer retreat. En route you’ll pass catacombs (the best being the San Sebastiano), the remains of Maxentius’s Villa and hundreds of glorious pine trees. Start early, wear comfortable shoes and carry water. Take the train back to Rome. Enjoy!JackArriving in Rome on the afternoon of a Coppa Italia Rome derby, we tried to find a bar showing the evening’s game in the Pigneto neighbourhood, where we were staying. We stumbled upon a craft beer pub (the Alvarado Street) covered in football scarves from around the world. All the seats had names taped on them, reserved for friends and regulars – but a couple of drinks and phone calls by the barman later and we had our own bean bags in among it all. Great beers and a great crowd – next time I’ll be bringing my Cardiff City scarf to add to their collection!AnyaLucignano, in eastern Tuscany near Arezzo, gets my vote. It’s small but perfectly formed, possessing all the essentials of an Italian hill town: imposing gates, watchtowers and ramparts. There’s a Medici-era fortress nearby a church rebuilt by Renaissance architectwriter Giorgio Vasari plus outstanding olive oil extolled by the likes of Strabo and Pliny the Elder. The time to go is during the Maggiolata spring festival, held the last two weekends of May, with flower-bedecked floats and a large tent where folks sit at communal tables to enjoy grilled Chianina steaks, pasta, wine and entertainment every evening. TheoZip. Tent open: the Dolomites. We’d woken to those jagged spires for almost a week. This morning’s vista was across the green valley to the shark fin of the Sassolungo. Circling it was the aim for the day. An espresso on the piazza in Canazei was for fuel. Then we headed for the Col Rodella gondola. It’s a gateway to another world nearly 2,000 metres up, where rolling meadows crash into spires of rock, cows moo, and ramblers scuttle like ants across the trails. Thirteen hours of walking took us over the col and into the vast Alpe di Siusi, the largest alpine plateau in Europe. Tired legs were later rewarded with a wine (or 10) at the bustling Bar Oma, back in Canazei’s quaint centre.Joseph FrancisFour readers recommended this place this week! EdIn rural Marche, not far from the Adriatic coast, Casal dei Fichi (flats from €870 a week) is a glorious place. So beautiful and relaxing that we seldom travel far from its peaceful grounds, inviting pool and stunning views. We might make a quick trip or two to the local market and vineyard to ensure we are well stocked for our stay, and an occasional lunch in one of the huge choice of local restaurants. That said, for the more active there is a wide range of activitiestrips that can be enjoyed, and hosts Ian and Bob are on hand to advise and assist. We can’t wait for these lockdown days to end so that we can escape to this little piece of heaven. DiThe Abbey of San Galgano (adults €4) is a glorious ruin, but the real reason you are there is to enter the small round Rotonda chapel in the grounds, in which you will see the “real” Sword in the Stone, plunged into solid rock by the knight Galgano, attempting to deny the angels. The sword sits in a perspex dome, protection against thieves. The mummified arms of one would-be thief remain there as a warning. Then ponder the similarities to the Arthurian legends. Coincidence? Gord PaynterFresh out of uni I visited Reggio di Calabria, city of my forebears, over Ferragosto and had a transformative experience. In this beautiful city, free of tour buses and souvenir shops, I observed a way of life both foreign and completely sensible. Seemingly everyone spent their days taking it slow: extended families gathering at the beach, strolling about town, having long outdoor meals, rambling along the stunning yet understated promenade (pictured). Something clicked: it dawned on me that people live this way and I could too. Years later I briefly lived in Italy and hope to move back with my family.Nick PostorinoAs a kid I spent many family holidays in Camogli, near Genoa. The topography of steep mountains rising from the coast forced the locals to build upwards, creating a labyrinth of alleys and stairways. Of course the food was good, great gelato and pasta, and the famous pesto genovese. But what stands out is the focaccia. Recco, just north of Camogli, is the home of a most delicious cheesy version that has spread – like the molten cheese inside it – over the whole area. Popping into a focacceria to get a pile of freshly baked focaccia slices and sharing them was the highlight of the day.Simon HoerHead north from Trento and you reach a curious mix of Italian and German language and culture around Siusi allo Sciliar. Visit San Valentino’s church, then take the cable car to the Seiser Alm, one of Europe’s highest mountain plateaux, with 240km of tracks and trails great for running, walking or biking. It’s perfect in spring or autumn: try staying in one of the family-run farms that offer local knowledge, homegrown produce and a friendly welcome. Public transport is excellent, and if you need a hand on the hills and with the altitude, e-bike hire means you can manage without a car.Tony WadeAt the centre of the Valchiavenna, north of Lake Como, lies the old town of Chiavenna, on the right bank of the river Mera. From the railway station we walked the short distance to the magnificent nature park and wildlife refuge that is the Parco delle Marmitte dei Giganti. Taking its main path overlooking the river, we continued on our way in seclusion towards Prosto, with its ancient bridge and church. Crossing the bridge, the path leads to the beautiful Acquafraggia waterfalls, whose soothing roar was completely mesmerising. We stayed at the brilliant Villa Très Jolie (doubles from €95 B\u0026ampB).Robert ConnollyUp the road from San Gimignano is the equally picturesque medieval town of Volterra, but without the crowds of shuffling tourists – except for one weekend in August, when the town dresses up in its medieval finery and goes back in time. There are food stalls aplenty, musicians at every turn and pageantry to fill the eye. It is the best of Italy inasmuch as it is noisy and seemingly chaotic but enormous fun. It’s a great day out for a family or even a solo traveller. Modern currency is not accepted you have to change your euros into the historical equivalent and you then buy your street food with this. Confusingly, you then use euros if you stop for a drink or a coffee in a bar.Nick StringerWe were fortunate enough to discover a boating lake in a romantic corner of the Villa Borghese, a park in Rome. It was a haven from the long, hot queues of Rome’s tourist sites. We hired a boat. The joy of rowing around the small lake with the person I love is a pleasure I will never forget. The sound of a harp from a nearby musician beckoned us towards the Temple of Asclepius on a small island in the middle of the lake. The statues and fountains looked so alluring. We got so close that at one point we feared one of the fountains would draw us in and engulf our boat with water. We had to row a hasty retreat in laughter just before our time was called.RogerTrattoria Trapani on Piazza Giulio Cesare in Palermo reminded me of someone’s pantry. A young man and his father greeted us with smiles as large as mine and my mother’s hunger. To the left was the grandparents’ territory, the kitchen. We were given complimentary panelle (chickpea fritters), a local tradition. When we finished, the father came over and said, “I get you something from my farm.” He returned moments later with a complimentary plate of juicy blood orange slices. When paying I complimented the son’s English. He replied, “The Beatles. The best teachers, right?” Our no-frills Sicilian dream included plates of swordfish and spaghetti vongole for less than €7 a plate.Marth SnellingOne Saturday in June, we attended the annual Archidado Joust in Cortona. Attired in colourful medieval costumes, teams from Cortona, Arezzo and Subbiano perform elaborate flag-tossing routines, with cute displays by children, all accompanied by drummers and trumpeters. The celebration starts with a crossbow tournament, followed by a procession of worthies, drummers, trumpeters, and the teams into Cortona town square. For the next few hours, we witnessed a colourful and atmospheric pageant as each team performed with skill and precision. John HellinikakisWhile exploring the spectacular south coast of Sardinia, we detoured by ferry to the island of San Pietro, tempted by the annual Girotonno tuna fishing and cooking festival, held at the end of every May. The ferry docks in Carloforte, the picturesque main town. We soaked up the atmosphere, sampled tuna cooked a myriad of ways, watched tuna-themed cookery demonstrations, danced into the small hours at concerts in the main square, wandered its colourful streets and vowed to return.Marian O’Mahony"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a104afad75b8a8197746ddd1186ac568297e24c/0_21_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1abc03d35d6b79d9dabb89aa0f464098","title":"ant and dec sincerely sorry for blackface sketches in early 2000s","story":"ITV presenters impersonated people of colour in Saturday Night Takeaway segmentsAnt and Dec have apologised for a segment of Saturday Night Takeaway in which they impersonated people of other ethnicities using blackface and said they would not make such sketches today.The presenters darkened their skin and wore prosthetics during a segment in which they pranked famous faces while in disguise. They said they had requested ITV, which broadcasts the show, to remove the offending sketches from 2003 and 2004 from its streaming catch-up service.A statement on their Instagram and Twitter accounts said: “During past episodes of Saturday Night Takeaway we impersonated people of colour in the Undercover segment of the show.“We realise that this was wrong and want to say that we are sincerely sorry to everyone that we offended.“We purposely stopped doing this several years ago and certainly would not make these sketches today.“We had already taken steps to ensure footage was taken down and have again recently confirmed with ITV that these segments, and any other historical content that could cause offence, does not appear on either the ITV Hub or the Saturday Night Takeaway YouTube Channel.”The pair wore blackface in 2003 as they dressed up as two fictional Jamaican women, Patty and Bernice, to prank Emmerdale cast members.

But Queer Eye is one of the very few to succeedAs Queer Eye reaches its sixth season, its well received mission to put the self love in selfie has led to a resurgence in makeover shows, with a much-needed twist. Queer Eye is an empathetic tearjerker with its kinder approach to the genre, but the makeover shows that dominated the noughties were better known for their caustic putdowns.They were desperately cruel: the central premise of Snog, Marry, Avoid? was slut shaming, as well as essentially telling members of subcultures that they needed to be “normal” to gain acceptance. What Not To Wear saw Trinny and Susannah take scissors to the less-than-chic wardrobes of the public. Last year The Surjury offered a throwback to this period: a Channel 4 show that would have seen contestants attempt to convince a jury of 12 panellists that they were in need of plastic surgery. The backlash was huge, although it was ultimately pulled because of the sad death of its intended host, Caroline Flack.So what should a makeover show look like today? The rise of body positivity, female empowerment and self care means that jibes about double chins and crow’s feet don’t go down as well as they once did. And a greater push toward ersity means hosts and experts come in all shapes and sizes, and from all walks of life. But at times it simply feels like a syrupy veneer applied to what is largely the same product.The biggest change is not necessarily the ethos, but the tone. Hosts as harsh as Nicky Hambleton-Jones or Gillian McKeith have been replaced by those able to deliver similar messages, more delicately. BBC’s You Are What You Wear, which starts today, is fronted by the affable Rylan Clark-Neal, alongside a cohort of five erse stylists armed with compliments. Criticism is only ever light as the contestants wardrobes are reinvented.Embracing body positivity, one of the stylists specialises in dressing fuller figures. But much like modern “brand” feminism, there is an inherent cognitive dissonance in a show fixated on appearance while simultaneously trying to rubbish the idea that appearance matters at all. In the first episode we meet a PE teacher who lives in trackies and trainers because she finds them more comfortable. It’s hard to see why she needs a makeover at all.\u0026nbspHow To Look Good Naked, from 2006, returned to screens this year. Gok Wan’s Channel 4 show was always well ahead of its time, so hasn’t had to update much to work for a new generation of viewers. Its central message has always been normalising the female form, celebrating stretch marks and mum tums. But even Gok fell into the trap of suggesting shapewear to cover up bad bits that viewers had just been taught to flaunt.In today’s iteration we still see women’s bodies being paraded to the public in stunts. The opinion of strangers is still considered the barometer of worthiness. Though the comments are comparatively kind, we never quite shake the message that, bad or good, it’s what other people think about our appearance that matters most.Another rebooted franchise is 10 Years Younger, with a new home at Channel 5. It is hosted by the amiable Cherry Healey, but that isn’t enough to smooth its sharp edges. It’s hard not to wince when the British public bluntly weigh in on how old they think the women are and then watch them being delivered the news that they look a few years older as if they had terminal cancer. Even with likable, kindly hosts, these shows cannot help but veer into “hot or not” territory. Therein lies one of the biggest issues – how does one make a show entirely about looks, without being shallow?\u0026nbspQueer Eye, with the gang’s multi-pronged, in-depth approach to all areas of their participants’ lives, seems to be one of the few programmes that has managed to truly make over the makeover genre. Another, which began last year, is Drag SOS, which saw the drag queen collective The Family Gorgeous give men and women drag makeovers that boosted their confidence. Participants developed a drag persona and learned choreographed dance routines – along with bucketloads about themselves in the process – all leading up to a one-off performance.What’s clear is that it is not impossible to create makeover shows with heart, but many are still only willing to go skin deep.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9389da9d4c95aefd3eb6b377d8360e26b10e7c7a/125_0_4375_2625/master/4375.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23e1a0c068d6ef55ce3e9f46be411a04","title":"has time in lockdown made you want to approach life differently","story":"If this experience has given you a chance to take stock and make some resolutions for the future, we want to hear from youLiving in lockdown has put everyone under strain, but it may also have given some of us time to take stock and work out what we really want from life.

Almost certainly too small to be a personal ornament or intended to be on display, he says, “it looks like an object that you would carry with you in a bag, perhaps with other objects.\u0026nbspThe findings are published in the journal Plos One.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a20e071767c0c17df7e6eaa01cf6862fbd441c/0_376_5219_3132/master/5219.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c23bb23e4d3c710dfe9de369ff6af7fd","title":"eu says china behind huge wave covid 19 disinformation campaign","story":"Brussels shifts position by accusing Beijing for first time of running false campaignsChina has been accused by Brussels of running disinformation campaigns inside the European Union, as the bloc set out a plan to tackle a “huge wave” of false facts about the coronavirus pandemic.\u0026nbspThe European commission said Russia and China were running “targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns in the EU, its neighbourhood, and globally”. While the charge against Russia has been levelled on many occasions, this is the first time the EU executive has publicly named China as a source of disinformation.\u0026nbspFrench politicians were furious when a Chinese embassy website claimed in mid-April, at the height of Europe’s pandemic, that care workers had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The unnamed Chinese diplomat also claimed falsely that 80 French lawmakers had used a racist slur against the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.“I believe if we have evidence we should not shy away from naming and shaming,” Vĕra Jourová, a European commission vice-president, told reporters.\u0026nbsp“What we also witnessed is a surge in narratives undermining our democracies and in effect our response to the crisis, for example the claim there are secret US biological laboratories on former Soviet republics has been spread by both pro-Kremlin outlets, as well as Chinese officials and state media.”“I strongly believe that a geopolitically strong EU can only materialise if we are assertive,” Jourová said, alluding to the aim of the European commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, for the body to have more clout on the world stage.The more assertive stance marks a change in tone from a report in March which merely described Chinese media narratives, while focusing the spotlight on disinformation from Kremlin-backed sources. It comes after lawmakers in the European parliament accused the commission of watering down an earlier report on disinformation under pressure from China – charges EU officials strongly denied.\u0026nbspEU member states are grappling with how to deal with China on a range of fronts, from foreign policy and security, to the economy. The commission described China as a “systemic rival” in a 2019 report that was seen by many member states as marking a watershed in how the EU deals with an increasingly aggressive government in Beijing.The commission has encouraged social media companies to sign a voluntary code of practice on disinformation, while threatening regulation if they fail to act. The latest report steps up demands on platforms to be more transparent in sharing data with researchers and intensify work with independent fact checkers.\u0026nbsp“I would not like the platforms

inside one other household and even stay overnight without maintaining physical distancing.A single-person household will be able to join together with a multi-person household, so a lone parent could, for example, visit their children’s grandparents in another part of England for help and stay for an extended period.It will also mean a couple who live apart can be together for the first time during the lockdown, if at least one of them lives alone.However, any multi-person household will only be able to join with one single-person household, so it would mean hard choices for a group of people living together with partners who live alone elsewhere.It will also not apply to people told to shield, who are meant to be isolating until the end of June apart from being able to meet one other person outside their home.If any member of the support bubble developed coronavirus symptoms, all the members would have to follow the normal advice on household isolation.Explaining the new rules, Johnson said: “We are making this change to\u0026nbspsupport\u0026nbspthose who are particularly lonely as a result of lockdown measures.\u0026nbsp“It’s a targeted intervention to limit the most harmful effects of the current social restrictions.\u0026nbsp“It is emphatically not designed for people who don’t qualify to start meeting inside other people’s homes, because that remains against the law.”\u0026nbspThere were 8.2 million people living alone last year and 2.9 million lone parent\u0026nbsphouseholds, according to the Office for National Statistics.“We would want to make sure that people who have been\u0026nbspsuffering from loneliness, and have been unable to see their families for a long\u0026nbsptime, the rest of their families, are able to do that,” Johnson added.The news is likely to be met with relief from people who live alone but frustration among others who will still not be able to meet loved ones unless physically distancing outside in groups of up to six.Officials admitted the measure was not going to benefit everyone but was targeted at those who had been left isolated by the lockdown restrictions.\u0026nbspThe government has been criticised for prioritising the reopening of the economy, including zoos, shops and outdoor cinemas, above people’s social contact with their families and the full return of schools.However, ministers and the scientific advisers have stressed that the biggest risk of transmission is within households rather than distanced workplaces, so they have been acting with caution to ease restrictions on families meeting each other.One exemption to the exclusivity rule will be that parents who are separated can continue to move children between households, so the children of separated parents could potentially be in two separate support bubbles – one bubble for each parent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27be312de7cb89b3e9dcebca1ca18ddeb8c2ec1b/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6d354827d12db0ddc404624982abdb7","title":"in 12 weeks we can turn the tide now we can ask was pm right","story":"Coronavirus deaths and infections are dropping, but experts fear lockdown is being eased too soonby  Robert Booth,  Heather Stewart and  Richard PartingtonOn 19 March, just a few days before he self-isolated with Covid-19, a sunken-eyed Boris Johnson\u0026nbsptold the daily Downing Street briefing that in 12 weeks “we can turn the tide”. “I am absolutely confident that we can send coronavirus packing,” he said.\u0026nbspOn Thursday those 12 weeks are up – and they have seen the country go through turmoil.The lockdown is being loosened, but fears of a second wave are rife.So has the tide really turned?On Wednesday, Downing Street was upbeat. But interviews with experts, and analysis of the government’s own data, paint a grim picture of what the UK has endured – and a lack of confidence about what the next 12 weeks may hold.First glance at the now-familiar government graphs suggest the curves tracking new infections and deaths are showing significant improvements, at least when viewed from the devastating peak of the outbreak around Easter, when new infections hit 3,918 on 5 April and deaths peaked at 943 a day on 11 April, taking rolling averages.\u0026nbspCloser inspection reveals a less comforting picture. When Johnson spoke 12 weeks ago there were 913 new cases of coronavirus recorded each day on average. At the latest count there were 1,543.Twelve weeks ago the seven-day rolling average for daily deaths was just 21 this week it remains 10 times higher. As the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, reminded Johnson in parliament on Wednesday, the UK’s excess deaths during the pandemic have passed 63,000 – higher than in Italy, Spain and France. As Greece (with a death toll of 183) welcomes holidaymakers, Britons still cannot stay overnight with extended family in most cases.Scientists are also concerned that as lockdown lifts, the test, trace and isolate system for quelling future outbreaks is not robust enough. The care sector, where at least 15,000 have died from Covid-19 so far, warns that the government’s tactics to protect the most vulnerable in a second wave remain largely unchanged.It is the sheer numbers of infections and deaths at the peak that have shocked many. Two days before Johnson made his prediction, the UK government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said less than 20,000 deaths would be “a good outcome”.That milestone was passed more than six weeks ago. According to Sir David King, a former chief scientific adviser and now chairman of an independent version of the government’s Sage advisory group, that could have been the total death toll.King has calculated that if Johnson had ordered the lockdown on the day he promised to “turn the tide”, rather than four days later, transmission would have been slashed and fatalities halved. Prof Neil Ferguson, the Imperial College epidemiologist and former government adviser, also said on Wednesday that the death toll could have been halved if lockdown had come a week earlier.We have not “sent coronavirus packing”, King says, because the R factor – the rate of reproduction – is still not low enough. His group is worried we are risking a second wave by lifting lockdown restrictions now.“There has been a series of really dreadful mistakes by this government that has led to a vast number of people dying and they need not have died,” he said.His calculation about an earlier lockdown was supported by Prof Roland Kao, chair of epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh. He found that if Scotland had gone into lockdown two weeks earlier, its death toll could have been cut to a fifth of the country’s 4,000 deaths now linked to the disease.\u0026nbsp“Cutting the virus off earlier has a huge benefit,” said Kao, who warned the tail of the epidemic is likely to be unpredictable and long.Some modellers predict more grief to come even in this first wave. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Washington DC, for example, believes the UK could suffer another 3,500 Covid deaths by 4 August.Critics say the tide has not turned in other ways too. The government’s test, trace and isolate system remains “not even close” to being able to keep up with new infections, said King. Care homes complain about a continued lack of testing to control outbreaks which can spread through asymptomatic staff and residents.“We need much clearer protocols on planning for a second wave and they need to make their plans public,” said Martin Green, chief executive of the industry group Care England. “We need either weekly or fortnightly testing.”Care minister Helen Whately said on Tuesday she is expecting scientific advice soon on the appropriate frequency of repeat testing. Some care managers now want ministers to use hospitals to quarantine infected residents in future outbreaks, as happened in Hong Kong where no one has died from Covid-19 in a care home.“In any assessment of turning the tide you have to include preparedness and clarity of action against Covid,” said Dan Hayes, chief executive of the Order of St John Care Trust, which runs 82 care homes and accommodation centres where 242 residents died from Covid-19. “We still don’t have certainty about care residents being able to access hospital treatment on the same basis as everyone else. There is still a viewpoint that people in care homes will not benefit from treatment.”The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said the government’s “Protect the NHS” mantra had obscured other important aims.“The prime minister had all this rhetoric about turning tides, and taking things on the chin,” he said. “Twelve weeks later, we have one of the highest excess death rates in the world. And yes, the NHS has coped: but it’s coped on the back of discharging its patients into care homes cancelling operations delaying treatments for cancer – which probably means we’ll have waiting lists at 10m by Christmas.”Downing Street, by contrast, takes a very different view of its performance – and the outlook for the future.Referring to Covid-19 as “an invisible mugger”, Johnson claimed in the House of Commons on Wednesday that it had been an “astonishing achievement” to “drive down the curve”.Asked about whether the country had “turned the tide”, his spokesperson added: “Thanks to the very hard work of the British public we have now passed through the peak and you are seeing the key indicators like the new hospital admissions, new infections and the number of deaths falling. But at the same time we know we have much, much more to do in order to both beat this virus and put the country fully on the road to recovery.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The effects of climate change could damage, and possibly even destroy, our collective heritageAgriculture Minister accuses Green party leader of doing a \u0026lsquodisservice\u0026rsquo to rural communities"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winterA new report shows no let-up in the loss of wildlife in Northern IrelandCorncrakes get major EU funding despite being of \u0026lsquoleast concern\u0026rsquo on Red List criteria"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

File photograph: RollingNews.ieThe Minister for Health Simon Harris has been asked to investigate claims of neglect involving a nursing home resident with “seriously infected and possibly infested wounds.”Sage Advocacy, a support group for vulnerable adults, has written to Mr Harris requesting an investigation into the case of the resident and “the adequacy of response by statutory agencies.”The group disclosed details of the case in a submission to the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel which is reviewing the response to the pandemic in care facilities.It raised the case in arguing that it was not clear who is responsible for clinical care in nursing homes and there were no Health Information and Quality Authority regulatory standards for the level and skills of nursing care, clinical governance and level of medical cover in many homes.The group said that the significance of these points was “reinforced most graphically” in recent days when it had to send a fourth “Notice of Care” to Hiqa, the State’s health service watchdog, over the care of the unnamed resident.It said in the submission that the person had “seriously infected (and possibly infested) wounds relating to a medical condition and other evidence of neglect.”“We sought the intervention of the HSE who were able to pursue the issue because the person concerned was transferred to an acute hospital,” said Sage in its submission.“However, neither Hiqa or the HSE seemed able to effectively intervene in the nursing home to investigate such a situation and ensure that all other residents are safeguarded.”A spokesman for Hiqa said that it was aware of the information in the Sage submission and had engaged with both the care provider and staff at Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown, Dublin, where the inidual is being treated, about the care of the person.Hiqa had carried out an inspection of the nursing home on June 4th and that this inspection report would be published, the spokesman said.Sage previously told the Oireachtas committee examining the pandemic response that there was a “significant blind spot” at statutory level in the case of elderly people and that there were “systemic weaknesses” in the outsourced system of care for the elderly.The Department of Health said the correspondence had been received and is under consideration."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275924.1591815052!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ppe shipment from china amounts to just over 12 days stock","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIn Ireland the Government is stockpiling personal protective equipment  in anticipation of a second wave of Covid-19.

They also received training in the correct use of PPE and in reducing their exposure to infection when caring for patients.None of the study participants reported Covid-19 related symptoms.

Above, protective face masks at a clothing stall in Norwich, in the UK. Photograph: Chris RatcliffeBloombergGo into any supermarketshop, or take any form of public transport in Ireland, and it is clear few people are wearing face masks. It is hard to resist the conclusion that either they are utterly confused by changing public health messaging, or they don’t see the merit of wearing a mask. Those in the latter camp may believe this Covid-19 pandemic is dealt with as Irish deaths and cases are close to zero – and wish to get back to normal as quickly as possible. Or they are not prepared to put up with what they perceive as the hassle of wearing a mask with all the protocols about how to put it on and take it off correctly, not forgetting re-use procedure. There is social stigma too around wearing them.While the world for the most part agreed on the best way to deal with the Covid-19, ie lockdown, physical distancing and repeated handwashing, the same cannot be said about face masks. There is huge variation between countries in some they are mandatory in public places, in others they are worn routinely whenever there is risk of an epidemic. Differing advice from health authorities doesn’t help.A lot comes down to interpreting research, evaluating risk and factoring human behaviour. So scientists don’t reach an absolute position and governments wrestle with what to tell their citizens who are demanding clarity.What on balance is best advice?Advice on whether to wear a mask has changed in line with emerging research about Covid-19. Evidence backing the wearing of masks in public, where there is community transmission, has strengthened – especially in confined spaces. They do not need to be worn in the open air or while driving a car.When it comes to those over 60, whose immune system is weakening coinciding with ageing, and those with underlying conditions, the case is clear-cut. Moreover, this age group should wear medical-grade masks that, fortunately, are now more readily available, though not cheap.What is the latest advice from the World Health Organisation?In the past week, WHO has come out more strongly in favour of masks, with a variation of types recommended depending on circumstances. Its updated guidance says the public should wear masks where physical distancing is not possible. It is firmly in favour of medical masks for the over-60s and those with pre-existing conditions. A cloth mask of at least three layers is best for the general public. Initially, the WHO was almost anti-mask, insisting many people won’t wear masks properly, thereby risking infection. Masks give people a false sense of security and encourage risky behaviour, it contended. Compounding matters was the obvious shortage of masks for healthcare workers as cases rose rapidly. WHO accepts growing indications that the more people use masks, the lower the transmission, notably from those who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. Previously it recommended masks for people who are symptomatic, to prevent spread to others.What research is persuasive in favour of face masks?At the onset, scientific evidence on the effectiveness of face masks in slowing transmission of respiratory diseases was limited. There was no data on Covid-19 since it was a previously unknown disease.However, there is a growing body of evidence favouring face masks and cloth coverings. This week a UK study found population-wide face mask use could push Covid-19 transmission down to controllable levels, and prevent further waves of the virus when combined with minor lockdowns. A US study found that if 80 per cent of a closed population were to don a mask, infection rates would statistically drop to approximately one-twelfth the number of infections – compared to “a live-virus population” in which no one wore masks.Where does Ireland stand in light of revised WHO guidance?NPHET’s expert advisory group is to review the latest WHO recommendations, but evaluation of current advice suggests Ireland is very much aligned with that viewpoint – though there may be a difference of emphasis.The bottom line, however, is mask use is nowhere near the level warranted. There has been a failure of national advice to hit the target – understandable at a time of exponential rise in cases less acceptable when easing lockdown.There is much catching up to do, to ensure supply of more specialist masks are available for those who are vulnerable to Covid-19 and those who cannot afford a mask or make a cloth version. Supplying free masks to every household could make up lost ground.What is the prudent way to proceed?There is no going back to normal soon. Risk of contamination of surfaces and infection is ever present. Good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette, while maintaining physical distancing where possible is still the winning formula. But “wear a mask” in the correct way has rightly been added to that mix.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocall IrelandPA Talks will continue on the formation of a government on Thursday with progress reported on several issues on Wednesday, but no sign yet of a decisive breakthrough.Sources now fear the talks could run into the weekend, despite the belief in all parties that this week represented a final deadline to reach agreement.One source reported significant progress on Wednesday with agreement on a text covering a number of policy areas in a proposed programme for government, but added that this was on less contentious issues. The role of agriculture in reducing greenhouse gas emissions remains a key sticking point, with isions between the Green Party and Fine Gael on the issue demonstrated on Wednesday when Green leader Eamon Ryan and Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed clashed during a Dáil debate.Sources said all parties knew the “landing zone” for agreement is for average annual reductions to be about 7 per cent, but that there would not be complete clarity about how that would achieved in the later years of a five-year term. One Green source acknowledged it would not be possible to have a detailed roadmap for the reductions in emissions every year, and the Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton referenced the example in the Dáil of Denmark – a country specifically identified as a role model in the Green manifesto. “The reality is that we will probably end up in a position like Denmark, which has committed to high ambition but cannot specify all of the pathway,” he said. “That is the reality we will have to follow.”If negotiating teams and the deputy leaders agree the bulk of a text on Thursday or Friday, the remaining issues will be “kicked upstairs” to the party leaders to agree. Green agreementFine Gael and Fianna Fáil doubt that Green deputy leader Catherine Martin will agree a final text approved by the leaders, but Ms Martin has told her party she wants to get a deal that will gain the two-thirds support it needs among Green members. Meanwhile, Rise TD Paul Murphy sought to stoke Green Party fears that it will be attacked from the left after a deal. Mr Murphy said the Greens would be a “mudguard” for “neo-liberal and austerity policies” if they agree to share power.He said the Greens will be blamed for every “austerity” measure under the guise of it being “about the environment”.Mr Ryan said he “fundamentally disagrees” with claims his party will be bad for farmers, as Mr Creed accused him of doing a “disservice” to farmers over their efforts on bioersity.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty said he has been in touch with Mr Ryan to tell him that his party still wants to form a government and will attempt to do so if the current talks are unsuccessful.“We’ve made sure we have been in contact over the last number of days,” Mr Doherty said. “We have reassured people we want to be part of a government for change.”“It is important that the Greens know there are other options.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4275991.1591824734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord greens in or out that s the only question in leinster house","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour’s Seán Sherlock couldn’t wait to hear what Green leader Eamon Ryan had to say as ‘a prospective tánaiste giving us a sense of his vision’. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIs it that time of the year again?How quickly the months pass. It seems like only yesterday when the last Fluff ’n’ Puff jamboree was held in the Dáil. Those TDs, they really love their annual Climate Change Big Day Out.The event is so significant it is enshrined in law. Under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the relevant minister must present an “annual transition statement” to both houses of the Oireachtas, including an overview of what the government is doing to combat climate change while outlining future plans for curbing dangerous emissions.This is the fourth one. It was published in December and brought for discussion on Wednesday by Richard Bruton.“It is an honour to have the opportunity to make a transition statement at this time,” he said, in what might have been a nod in the direction of his party’s protracted ongoing government formation talks with the Greens. But he was giddily referring to next week’s “first anniversary of the publication of Ireland’s first ever whole-of-government climate action plan”.There isn’t a scrap of bunting left in the country.Fianna Fáil’s Seán Fleming welcomed the debate but he didn’t think the Minister’s contribution was much good as there was nothing about implementation.“The entire report is only fluff and puff,” he concluded. “I want less fluffy policy statements and want specific reports on the issues in the future.”He was followed by John Lahart. “Like my colleague, I want to huff and puff also, but I will take the opportunity to advocate for the cycling argument,” fluffed the TD for Dublin South West, forgetting Seán had been huffing about the Minister’s puffing and making no such pronouncement on his own sterling efforts.Sinn Féin’s David Cullinane was also unimpressed. “I agree,” he declared, waving the report in the air. “This is 70 pages of fluff. There isn’t much in it.”However, having listened to the strong points made by Fleming about the need for specifics, he was sure next year’s report will see “no more huff and puff and that Fianna Fáil are going to blow the house down and usher in a new level of transparency”.Only in the event of them forming a government with Fine Gael and the Greens, he added. But will the Greens go in or stay out? That is the question, the only question, in Leinster House these days.During the debate, TDs from parties involved in the talks went nowhere near the subject. Everyone else was fascinated.Eamon Ryan came into the chamber for the second session of statements on the annual statement, but gave nothing away. This time, as Richard Bruton had done his two hour Covid-restricted stint, Michael Creed, the Minister for Agriculture, was pressed into action.Meanwhile, Eamon Ryan was annoyed with people putting it about that the Green Party in government would be a bad thing for farmers.He found an ally in Bríd Smith. The People Before Profit TD rounded on “people who claim to be the defenders of rural Ireland and loudly attack the Greens for trying to destroy rural Ireland”. These iniduals talk about the party’s proposals on farming like they are “the greatest threat since the Famine or since Cromwell.”In the fight to reverse climate change “farmers are critical. They’re the heroes, they’re going to be the key,” said Ryan, quoting a German politician he admires. “And he’s right.”Labour’s Seán Sherlock couldn’t wait to hear what the Green leader had to say as “a prospective tánaiste giving us a sense of his vision”. Eamon Ryan looked up at him, but, unusually, he didn’t crack a smile. And his expression didn’t change either when Sherlock added that Michael Creed, “potentially the continuing or next minister for agriculture, is also here to listen to that view”.Fianna Fáil’s man at the farm gate, Charlie McConalogue, must have been raging he didn’t get a mention.So what were Creed’s thoughts on the “disparity between the Government’s 3.5 per cent target for reducing emissions and the 7 per cent or 6.5 per cent target that is being bandied about as part of the discussions of the programme for government?”Sherlock had asked Richard Bruton the same question earlier, getting back a convoluted but carefully non-committal reply. He fared no better with Creed. What about Eamon Ryan? Any thoughts on the Greens holding out for those increased targets?Bríd Smith was concerned that Ryan’s party’s negotiating team may be green by nature as well as by name.“If they believe a 7 per cent reduction will be achieved under a party merged with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, they’re fooling themselves. They may think it may not happen in four years but it could happen in 10. I can guarantee them that with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael driving the policy, it will not happen in 100 years, and the seas will be washing over us.”Paul Murphy of Rise beseeched the Greens to think again. There is still time to escape the evil clutches of Leo Varadkar and Micheál Martin, who are trying to lure them down the path to eco-neoliberal perdition, egged on by the scheming right-wing media.“There is an alternative, which is to join with the eco-socialist left.”Otherwise, the party will end up as nothing more than a “green mudguard” for the two big parties, and that way spells disaster.In the chamber, methane hung heavily in the air for the entire day, even though all the doors were thrown open.Independent TD Michael Fitzmaurice had some fascinating thoughts on wind and how seaweed can stop cows farting too much.“The report on methane in regard to suckler cows shows that using seaweed products has brought that down by 79 per cent. These are the angles we should be looking at, not kicking farmers and saying we should be culling half or three-quarters of the national herd.”Limerick’s Richard O’Donoghue, one of the new recruits to the Rural Independents, said people on the ground in rural Ireland feel they are not being listened to.“We are the best country in the world for protecting and respecting other people’s cultures, except when it comes to our own and especially when it comes to the farming sector,” he said, establishing his membership credentials of the group.He said reducing the number of Friesian bull calves being born would help cut the size of the national herd.

Photograph: Andrew TestaNew York TimesBritain wants to accelerate the pace of its negotiations with the European Union by changing the format of the talks, a cabinet office minister told MPs on Tuesday. Paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any agreement must be in place before the end of the year so that businesses would have time to adapt to its terms.“There is no point in our arriving at an agreement at the 11th hour: we have to arrive at an agreement to enable it to be implemented and ratified, but also in order for our citizens and businesses to prepare. That is what is dictating the timetable, and that is why we must have renewed focus. We are talking to the EU about having a change of format – about how we can increase the pace of negotiations, get the focus where we need it to be, and get a deal done for both our sakes,” she said.‘Achingly pragmatic’Ms Mordaunt said the government would soon publish plans for preparing Britain’s border operations for changes after the end of the post-Brexit transition period. But she declined to give details and said officials were planning for all outcomes, including the possibility that no deal would be agreed.“It would be prudent and wise for us to prepare for every scenario, just as we have always done. We did so last year and then did not need to implement those preparations. I am confident that we cannot only come to an agreement but do so in a timeframe that gives people the time that they need to prepare and to understand. We are very aware of the other things that are going on in the world that form the backdrop to that. Our approach is going to be achingly pragmatic,” she said.Transition periodFormer Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith said that businesses in the North had told him they were moving jobs to the Republic because of the implications of the Northern Ireland protocol. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna drew the minister’s attention to last week’s vote in the Northern Ireland Assembly calling for an extension to the transition period.“The government insisted that the Northern Ireland Assembly should have the final say on the protocol. The Assembly finally gave a say on Brexit when it voted last week to request an extension to the transition period to allow businesses, which are currently in the fight of their lives due to Covid, to adapt and to have the certainty that the minister refers to. If the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consent is so vital, should the government not listen to what it says?” she said.Ms Mordaunt said that, although the Assembly would determine whether the terms of the protocol remain in force in a few years’ time, the government would not extend the transition.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Educating our children must be a priority. But the Government’s mismanagement – and even blind spot – on this issue puts at risk the welfare and education of children as well as denting the prospects of recovery.For weeks, parents and teachers were told that all children will be back at school for a month before the summer. However, on Monday, without warning, ministers ditched that commitment. Responsibility for this lies at the door of No 10. There was no plan, no consensus, no leadership.The longer schools are shut, the greater the damage to children’s wellbeing and education and the increasing pressure on parents who are having to juggle childcare and work commitments. The warning from the Children’s Commissioner a few days ago could not have been starker: a generation of children now risk losing out on over six months of education.I do not underestimate how difficult it is to reopen schools safely in the current climate. But those difficulties were entirely foreseeable. It should have been obvious that serious effort was going to be needed to support children’s education during the pandemic. Weeks ago, I urged the Prime Minister to secure a national consensus on the reopening of schools to address the valid safety concerns being raised. I even offered to work with him to find a way through, but was ignored.It is characteristic of this Government’s handling of the pandemic. Too slow into lockdown, too slow on testing, too slow to get protective equipment to our frontline workers and now too slow on getting a plan in place for children’s education. We now have the ridiculous situation where next week betting shops and theme parks will open, but parents are not clear when their children will go back to school.There is a very real risk that this country will lag behind the rest of the world in its recovery and in the wellbeing and education of our children because of the mistakes this Government has made. We cannot allow that to happen. We need decisive action. That requires three things.First, a national plan to reopen our classrooms safely. That plan should be developed in the next fortnight with those who understand schools best: parents, teachers, education unions and council leaders. Without a plan, there is a risk that even by September many schools will not be able to reopen, and some children could be out of education for an entire year. I remain committed to working with the Prime Minister to develop that plan in the national interest.Second, there is no doubt that the way children are educated needs to change in light of the pandemic. Schools cannot reopen as normal. Adaptations need to be made so that teachers, children and parents can be kept safe. Introducing these changes must be a national effort using the creativity of the British people. Towns, villages and cities are full of empty buildings and spaces that can be repurposed. Theatres, museums, libraries and leisure centres could be repurposed and opened for children.Third, we need to take steps now to reverse the gaps in attainment that have been worsened during the lockdown. Despite the best efforts of teachers, millions of children will have gone without a proper education for nearly three months. They cannot wait until September to start learning again.None of this is beyond the capability of government. It simply requires focus and determination to do the best for our children.The Chancellor’s pre-Budget report next month must therefore include additional resources to fund schemes that can educate children over the summer months. I would also urge the Government to issue guidance requiring all children of school age to have a one-on-one meeting, with a teacher from their school and parents before the summer holidays start.At Prime Minister’s Questions today, Boris Johnson did not appear to understand the urgency and the scale of the challenge of getting schools back up and running safely as soon as possible. Parents and teachers can see the mistakes that have been made, but what they need now is a strategy they can trust.

We are suffering from the worst possible Covid combination: the largest number of excess deaths per capita, and the sharpest recession of any rich country. It’s a nightmare and, together with the quarantine chaos and the failure of the NHS tracing app, helps to explain why the Government appears so discombobulated, so deflated, so risk-averse.Johnson’s luck has temporarily run out. The scientists gave him the wrong advice at the start, the bureaucracy let the country down appallingly, he and his top team caught the virus and he is now making his own, unforced errors, as he struggles to push through the unlocking of Britain. Even his staunchest supporters are baffled: what is going on? Tory MPs are panicking, and for once have a point. Why is our crisis dragging on so much longer than that in France, Italy, Spain or Germany? Can we have the old Boris back please, and some of his buccaneering, can-do spirit?Yet all is far from lost, and it would be an act of extreme stupidity for the Tories to turn on Johnson now. The OECD forecast that the UK will suffer worse economically than its rivals is the product of a typically useless technocratic spreadsheet, ready to be refuted by reality. Britain’s daily deaths and infections continue to slide, and the economy is reopening. But if he is to capitalise on this, Johnson needs to start gambling again. Nowhere is this more true than with schools.Their closure has been a calamity, and was probably unnecessary to get the epidemic under control. Our understanding of how this virus works remains shockingly rudimentary, but not only is it almost entirely harmless to children, there is evidence that the virus peaked before lockdown, when schools were still open.Keeping them closed for so long is fast turning into a national scandal. The impact on children has been catastrophic: they are being robbed of their education, separated from friends, unable to play the sports that matter so much to so many of them. Dreams and opportunities are being extinguished, for approximately zero gain to the older people the policy is meant to be protecting. Almost all children have lost out, but by far the greatest impact will be on the poorest and most vulnerable.This madness must now end. Schools must be reopened fully, as a matter of national urgency, and with the same zeal, determination and strong messaging displayed at the start of the lockdown. It should become the Government’s totemic policy: Johnson must tell the nation that educating the next generation is more important than anything else.Even if it leads to a higher R rate, and even were it to mean that other social interactions would need to be curtailed to compensate (which I doubt), our children must come first (and it would certainly work as a slogan). It is true that some will become transmission vectors, spreading the virus to elderly or vulnerable adults. The answer is to focus the Government’s resources on managing and minimising this risk, shielding those who need it, without allowing it to terrify us into depriving an entire generation of its schooling.Ideally, and contrary to the Government’s pathetic capitulation this week, the reopening of schools would proceed over the next few weeks. Some social distancing would stay in place, but Johnson should immediately ditch the two-metre rule, replacing it with a one-metre guideline, as in France or Singapore. Almost every other Western country is managing it, so why can’t we?If that is still asking for too much, let me propose a final deadline of September to reopen all schools fully, with no social distancing, with a set of new cleanliness and testing protocols. We should not opt for some “Nightingale model”, whereby halls and churches are taken over to create weird socially-distanced experiences. That would be a sickening cop-out, a gigantic distraction: children deserve a renormalisation of their lives, not yet more ineffective “safetyism”.By the first day of next term, schools must guarantee no social distancing in the classroom or playground and no bubbles. Full school uniforms should be used again. All sports should return, including rugby. Canteens should reopen, though with tweaks for hygiene. Ditto IT rooms, libraries, science labs and the rest. Assemblies should be held as before. School buses, where they exist, should operate fully.The changes should focus on hygiene, PPE, testing and quarantining. There should be hand sanitiser everywhere, regular handwashing and cleaning of facilities and equipment (as now). Shared items should be disinfected at least once a day. Older teachers or those with conditions that put them at greater risk should wear masks or visors. Common-sense precautions should apply: if a young child needs carrying, it would make more sense for a younger teacher to do it rather than a 70-year old.But the greatest change should be testing: all children, staff and visitors to the school should undergo temperature checks on arrival. Anybody ill should not be allowed into the school, or kept in a special room until they can be picked up again. In parallel, the Government’s testing programme should pivot towards schools, children, teachers and parents: there needs to be mass and regular testing, and not just if anybody develops symptoms.Any school with a case of Covid should shut for a period, and everybody tested before they are allowed back. Children and families should be quarantined to contain the spread. There will doubtless be flare-ups, and at any one time 2-3 per cent of schools may have to be closed, as we have seen in Israel. We need a massive publicity campaign explaining why it is the right thing to do.I’m not blasé about this virus. I know people who have died. I worry about a second peak, though I’m also hopeful that a vaccine will rescue us. But no civilised society can order the reopening of its pubs and tennis courts while keeping its schools closed. Johnson must break from the overly cautious scientific establishment, and announce that he will guarantee a proper return to schooling for all children. Winners, as he knows full well, make their own luck.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dubious modelling compromising britains lockdown debate","story":"This was the week that the official Covid narrative reached peak absurdity. In the real world, wake-up call after wake-up call rang with grisly lucidity, while Britain remained trapped in its obsessive-compulsive second wave bunker. First came the warnings of a jobsageddon, as unemployment claims surged by 70 per cent. Then the news that NHS waiting lists are set to double to 10 million. This rounded off by Rishi Sunak’s revelation that school closures will wreck the UK more than the 2008 crash.But on Planet Lockdown, even these  grimmest of facts could not penetrate the powerful forcefield of Covid hysteria. So much so that No 10 has ditched plans to reopen primary schools, overwhelmed and intimidated by the strange new “safety first” neurosis sweeping through the public sector. At this crucial juncture that will decide Britain’s economic future, the nation is incapable of having a sensible lockdown debate.But perhaps this is no surprise, when virus modelling zealots continue to conflate, confuse and corrupt the scientific discussion. After playing a starring role in what may go down in history as the most seismic scientific error ever, Imperial College on Monday released a deeply odd paper, with a cunningly worded press release, claiming that “lockdown and school closures in Europe may have prevented 3.1 million deaths”.The hitch is that this impressive figure comes from comparing the actual death toll with the death toll in an imaginary counter-factual universe that could never have existed. The report appears to make the literally inhuman assumption that, if there had been no government measures imposed, not one person would have changed their behaviour in response to the virus– even though mobility data suggests mobility was falling before lockdown. It also assumes that in this parallel universe, 70 per cent of people would get the virus to reach herd immunity.This despite emerging evidence that calls such thinking into question, or at least complicates it significantly. The La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California has, for example, tested pre-Covid 19 blood samples and found that many have so-called “T cell reactivity” (a form of immunity) to the virus, even though they have never been exposed to it (but had almost certainly been exposed to at least three of the four common cold coronaviruses). They tentatively posit that such “cross-reactive immunity” could offer some people natural protection from Covid-19, which means that a great many people may have natural protection, making the herd immunity threshold potentially much lower.Could it be that burrowing down too deeply into the latest evidence risks rocking the foundations of lockdown? Other researchers have had no such qualms, revising their assumptions based on new information as it comes in rather than retreating to tired old models. The University of Oxford has, for example, just published research that explores what respiratory infection logs up to May might tell us about Covid in the community. This granular, evidence-led approach suggests that the infection rate fell significantly from March 15, long before lockdown orders were imposed.But the momentum somehow seems against them. From the study into the virus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where only 19 per cent of people were infected despite ideal spreading conditions – which could suggest widespread natural immunity – to early evidence of superspreaders in China and Italy, insights that challenge pro-lockdown assumptions have been sidelined from the start.And in an infuriating twist, a lot of very good modelling is going on in the margins. Neuroscientist Karl Friston, whose generative modelling, which is more responsive to uncertainties and adjusts assumptions as data flows in, is digging into whether natural immunity could explain Germany’s comparatively low fatality rate. Nobel prize-winner Michael Levitt has found that Covid has seemingly followed a so-called Sigmoid curve across the world, with exponential growth slowing after two weeks (rather than the virus continuously growing exponentially as assumed by Imperial).Mathematical research company Omega Analysis has compellingly predicted the daily increases in new cases in several countries using cutting-edge statistical methods. But this, alas, is a side story. Years from now historians will write books about how a mickey mouse discipline crept across Western universities like a cancer, spawning new fields (like climate modelling), and corrupting old ones (like epidemiology). Indeed, one of the most bizarre spectacles of this whole debacle has been to watch some modellers justify their murky findings by talking up fundamental epidemiological theory, as if it is the new physics.It cannot be a coincidence that, as the scientists refuse to engage with the real world, so too do the wider public. Life imitates art, so the merry cliche goes. But one might fear that Covid will give rise to a chilling new saying: life imitates science.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 11th june 2020","story":"Social distancing markers around the penguin enclosure at ZSL London Zoo in the capital\u0027s Regent\u0027s Park, where staff from the zoo have been preparing and are now ready for reopening next week with new signage, one-way trails laid out for visitors to follow, and extra handwashing and sanitiser stations in placeCoronavirus latest news: Councils need to take lead on schools, Ofsted chief suggestsWest Bank\u0026#39s ancient terraces threatened by settlers\u0026#39 plan to build business park on Unesco siteGovernment would \u0026#39love\u0026#39 to reduce two metre rule but cannot do so yet, housing minister admitsThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayBanksy artwork stolen from Bataclan in Paris turns up in mysterious circumstances in ItalyComment: Relaxing lockdown will be little more than cosmetic virtue signalling until we scrap the two-metre ruleThe future of The Queen: can the monarch ever rule in the same way again?Thursday morning news briefing: 2m rule to be scrappedProtesters tear down a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis in RichmondMadeleine McCann case: Police in Portugal remain convinced parents killed daughter, says prosecutorMadeleine McCann suspect \u0026#39broke into my flat and laid in wait under the bed\u0026#39, ex-girlfriend claimsBlack Lives Matter protest: Edward Colston statue retrieved from Bristol Harbour and taken to \u0026#39secure location\u0026#39Four in five happy to give more city space to bikes and pedestrians to keep air pollution downBaroness Hale: put juries in facemasks and get them back in courtProf Karol Sikora: Covid-19 death toll may be less than half of what has been recordedTurkey arms neighbourhood patrols as opponents fear President Erdogan is building a militiaNorth Korea warns US: Stay out of our affairs if you want a \u0026#39smooth election\u0026#39New Yorkers encouraged to wear masks while having sex to stop spreading coronavirusNurse died after patient she sat with tested positive for coronavirusDonald Trump\u0026#39s golf courses net large slice of taxpayer cashBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning news briefing 2m rule scrapped","story":"If you want to receive twice-daily briefings like this by email, sign up to the Front Page newsletter here.

But just how large could the damage of the prolonged school shutdown be?The national return to school is not going to plan.Last month the government said primary school children who have been at home under lockdown should start returning to classrooms from 1 June and that the re-opening of secondary schools could commence from 15 June.However, the re-opening up of primary schools has been much more patchy than expected, with only half of them opening their gates to some new pupils last week.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is time to put children’s interests first and reopen schoolsThe plan to reopen schools is equally impractical in SeptemberAnd now ministers are suggesting a return to full normality for education may not now come until after the summer holidays in September.Many parents were compelled by the school closures to look after their children during the daytime when they would otherwise have been working.Some have had to quit their jobs to do so. Others have had to reduce their hours. Many are juggling their formal work with childcare, putting great strain on families and harming their productivity.The delayed re-opening of schools will be a blow to many of those households.But if those parents can’t work, or can’t work at full capacity, even as some sectors of business are being allowed to re-open, it also threatens to be a blow to the wider economy. So how large could the damage of the prolonged school shutdown be?How many workers are affected?But not all these families will be affected equally by the school closures.Some of those parents will have been looking after children full-time already before the lockdown and some will have older children who don’t need as much direct supervision.Samuel Tombs of the economic consultancy Pantheon estimates that the school closures will have created a major childcare problem for around 4 million families and that around 2.5 million workers—7.5 per cent of the UK workforce —will have had to take leave their jobs to look after young children.How does this translate into economic harm?No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIf parents aren’t able to work as much as they otherwise would have because they have to provide more childcare this will likely have hit their income.This reduction in the workforce also negatively impacts the businesses that parents work for, or would otherwise have worked for.At the height of the lockdown the impact of this will have been mitigated because many firms were not operating at full capacity, or perhaps at all.But the damage will likely grow as the wider economy opens up but schools don’t and many parents find themselves unable to return to work.Schools also contribute to UK economic output themselves in the way the GDP figures are compiled (with every pupil in school counted as economic output).Education’s direct contribution to UK GDPSo school closures also have a direct negative impact on GDP.Mr Tombs estimates that a combination of these two factors mean school closures probably reduced GDP by around 8 per cent in April and May.The implication of a longer closure of schools is a longer drag on national output.Mr Tombs estimates that if pupils are still only in school around half of the time in the autumn, GDP will be 4 per cent lower than otherwise - in cash terms that would represent damage of around £7bn a month.Moreover, he warns that such a drag could extinguish hopes of a V-shaped recovery for the UK from the lockdown-induced recession.Are there any longer-term impacts?Experts are increasingly concerned about the negative impact of the school closures on the education of children, particularly those from more disadvantaged households who are less likely to be getting adequate schooling at home.Professor Simon Burgess of the University of Bristol and Professor Anna Vignoles of the University of Cambridge note that younger children particularly benefit from formal schooling.“The earlier years of a child’s life are pivotal for their development, and investment during this time is particularly valuable, in terms of improving their cognitive and non-cognitive skills,” they say.The longer the school shutdown the greater the harm to their development. By September many children will have had no formal schooling for almost six months. Estimated impact of school closures on GDP in April and MayExperts also fear that older children will get worse exam results due to school closures, harming their prospects in the labour market in the future.Modern economies increasingly rely on the “human capital” of their workforces to grow. This reflects a workforce’s skills and capabilities acquired through education.So, from that perspective, there is a clear danger that a longer school shutdown could inflict greater damage on the UK’s long-term economic growth potential.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The latest study, which involved 2,254 British adults, also revealed that around six in 10 people experienced worse sleep since lockdown began on 23 March.Charting Sweden’s no lockdown strategy“Nearly two-thirds of the UK public report some negative impact on their sleep from the Covid-19 crisis, clearly showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been for a very large proportion of us,” said Professor Bobby Duffy, director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London.“And this is clearly tied to both how stressful we’ve found the virus itself, and how much we fear the impact of the lockdown on our employment and finances.”Data gathered in April by wearable technology firm Withings showed that people in the UK had been sleeping for 15 minutes longer on average each day during the lockdown.France saw the biggest increase in daily sleep times, with the average person sleeping for an extra 20 minutes each night.These findings can be partly explained by people not having to commute to work due to either working from home or not working at all during lockdown.Similar data from fitness tracking firm Polar revealed that people in Germany are also sleeping for longer.A significant increase in sleep time was recorded by Polar’s sleep-tracking devices as lockdown measures were introduced in Germany on 22 March.Researchers at University College London (UCL) are currently studying the effects lockdowns are having on people’s mental health.Early results suggest that higher levels of anxiety and depression are linked to lockdown restrictions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Researchers have been unable to find how the bursts could be created, with the only certainty being that the very short but very powerful blasts must be emerging from some unknown, very extreme part of the universe.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe bursts come in a roughly 90 day window, which is then followed by a silent period for 67 days. The pattern then repeats, leaving a reliable 157 day period that was tracked over multiple years.That long pattern could suggest that the blasts are linked to the swirling, orbital motion of a massive star, a neutron star or a black hole.Mysterious signals coming from space answer matter puzzleThis is an exciting result as it is only the second system where we believe we see this modulation in burst activity, said Kaustubh Rajwade of The University of Manchester, who led the new research. Detecting a periodicity provides an important constraint on the origin of the bursts and the activity cycles could argue against a precessing neutron star.Fast radio bursts were first discovered in 2007, and were initially thought to be the result of a one-off event. Scientists then found in 2016 that FRB 121102 was in fact repeating.In the latest research, scientists then studied the source of the FRB using telescopes at Jodrell Bank, which allowed for regular monitoring over a long period that revealed the blast could be seen to be coming in a repeating patter when watched for a long time.This result relied on the regular monitoring possible with the Lovell Telescope, and non-detections were just as important as the detections, said Benjamin Stappers, who leads the MeerTRAP project to hunt for FRBs using the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

But organisers stepped up after the lockdown began and started providing 5,000 meals a week to families in Poplar struggling to afford or access food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesDizzee volunteered as part of his work with Kitchen Social – the Mayor’s Fund for London programme providing food for children across the capital during the school holidays. “I was given an amazing opportunity to visit and help out Kitchen Social at Bygrove Primary School in Poplar, who are providing free food, books and school equipment to kids in the local area where I grew up,” he said.“Thank you to all the amazing people I met and thanks to the Mayor’s Fund for London for connecting the dots.”How to support our campaignBygrove Primary School is also receiving vital supplies from The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project.The food surplus charity, which delivers to hundreds of food banks and community projects across London, began helping the school at the start of the crisis by dropping off one or two trays of fresh produce and staple items each week.The charity has since increased the supply from one or two trays of food each week to 40 trays to help organisers cope with the huge demand.Mark Causton, manager of the school’s initiative, said: “The Felix Project have been an immense help – I can’t praise them enough. We know we’ll need to carry on this work right through the summer, so we rely on all the fresh food they’re supplying.”Mr Causton added: “We’ve seen a lot of parents furloughed or losing work over the past couple of months. In the case of some families struggling to afford to buy shopping, this is one of their only sources of getting food for their children.“It was really great to have Dizzee Rascal here helping out. He got stuck in, and got on so well with all the volunteers and all the families. It was just nice to see a smile on a lot of people’s faces.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Figures from the Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) show a 175 per cent rise, with both charities reporting this their “busiest period ever”. Furthermore, a survey by the giving platform Neighbourly of 900 charities and community groups providing food to the vulnerable found that 70 per cent expect the situation to get even worse in the next six to 12 months.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent proprietor Evgeny Lebedev paid special tribute to the almost 6,000 ordinary iniduals who have dug deep to contribute to our appeal. He said: “Time and time again Londoners have shown that they are capable of immense generosity and community spirit in this period of crisis.“To all those that donated, bought and bid — I salute you.”Morgan Stanley said the bank and its employees in London had made the donation as part of their global Covid-19 response.How to support our campaignClare Woodman, head of Morgan Stanley EMEA, said: “The Felix Project plays a vital role in distributing food to people in need, especially those severely impacted by the pandemic. I am proud our employees in London are supporting them as part of our Covid-19 Hunger Relief Campaign.”Another substantial donor was Partners Capital investment group, which donated £95,287.John Collis, head of Partners Capital, Europe, said they “selected The Felix Project as one of our charities to support during this difficult period as it is one of the most impactful charities in London today”.Heads down for quiz nightThe original Top Gear trio — Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May — will tonight host a special Zoom quiz in aid of our appeal partner, The Felix Project. Participants in the Quintessentially Foundation’s “World’s Greatest Quiz Night” will face five rounds of questions devised by Nicholas Shearing, questions producer for top British TV quiz shows Pointless, Debatable and Impossible. May, who has driven Felix vans delivering food to vulnerable Londoners throughout lockdown, said: “At least in this stay-at-home pub quiz version, it will be easy to cheat.” 7.30-9pm. Tickets £10: thefelixproject.orggreatestquizOur appeal was also boosted by the silent auction, in partnership with Quintessentially Foundation, which closed this week with 135 bids placed for 36 lots and raising almost £40,000.The most highly prized lots were two tickets to a Liverpool FC game, four tickets to the Euro 2021 semi-finals, a video-chat with Spurs coach Jose Mourinho, a private guitar lesson with singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding and a helicopter lesson.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

After paying rent and all her bills from the universal credit she receives at the beginning of the month, she now finds she has just £4.30 left over for food and nappies for the rest of the month.How to support our campaignSo she is almost entirely dependent on school vouchers available for her oldest two children (£15 per child per week) to buy absolute essentials, and one weekly food package dropped off by the Sufra food bank.“I don’t mind going hungry sometimes, so long as my kids have food,” said Ms Sarri-Gonzalez. “Sometimes I might have just one main meal for myself in a day. There was one point during lockdown I didn’t manage to eat anything for myself for two days, almost three days. But I always set the table for the children – I keep things as normal as possible for them.”“It’s so difficult at the moment. So stressful. I’m hoping when the kids go back to school later in the year I can go back to work and make things easier somehow.”The Independent’s Help the Hungry campaign appeal partner The Felix Project has quadrupled the volume of surplus food it gets out to people in need since the crisis began.The work remains as urgent than ever. The most recent YouGov poll for the Food Foundation charity shows over 1.5 million people in households with children have been unable to access food for economic reasons during the lockdown.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe latest figures from The Trussell Trust show April was the busiest month ever for the network of food banks, with an 89 per cent increase in emergency parcels compared with the same month in 2019.And the number of parcels provided for children has more than doubled, while almost twice as many families with children are receiving them (a 95 per cent rise).Colman visits The Felix ProjectDr Rachel Loopstra, lecturer in nutrition at King’s College London, said: “It’s clear from the data, as well as from trends in foodbank use, that families with children are really struggling right now. Watching parents struggle to put food on the table and go without food themselves is devastating.”Rebecca Archer and her partner – who have three girls aged eight, six and three at home in London’s High Barnet – have found it difficult to afford enough food during lockdown. “The shopping I do is costing a lot more with them at home all the time,” she said.Once the bills are paid and the main weekly shop is done on a Monday, the couple finds they have about £50 left to get through the week – about half the amount they usually had before the pandemic hit.The family has recently taken advantage of two £15-a-week school vouchers they get for their two oldest girls, and receive some cooked meals from their neighbour Katie-Louise Barber – a volunteer delivering food using The Felix Project’s supplies.“It’s been a real strain. Thinking and worrying about money all the time isn’t easy,” said Ms Archer. “I never thought I’d be worrying about having enough for the children to eat. There was one point we just didn’t have enough for the pre-paid gas meter, so we had to go without that for more than a week.”The Trussell Trust, which runs the country’s biggest network of food banks, has warned food charities cannot cope “indefinitely” with the huge spike in demand for help caused by the pandemic.A coalition of anti-poverty charities had written to the chancellor asking for an emergency income support scheme that would increase child benefits and end the five-week wait for initial universal credit payments.Anthony Cotterill, leader of the Salvation Army in the UK, warned: “It’s years since we have seen poverty to be such a real and present danger for so many people. We are approaching a poverty tipping point.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis. Find out how you can help here.

Everyone is very grateful,’ says a volunteer who also uses service when his own illness means he is unable to pitch inFormer music manager John McIntyre was unsure how he would cope when lockdown began.“I was very scared,” said the 75-year-old who has a respiratory condition and lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Dalston. “If I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to get enough oxygen to the heart. I just had to follow the advice and be safe.” Mr McIntyre, who used to manage the jazz reggae band The Beatroots, has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema.He has relied for his daily meal from local charity Made In Hackney which is supplied by our Help the Hungry appeal partner, The Felix Project. Mr McIntyre is one of more than two million people who are classified as “extremely vulnerable” because they have compromised immune systems. For the last 10 weeks, many of them have struggled to get access to food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince March, volunteers from the River House Trust charity have been dropping off Felix produce to people living with HIV. One such volunteer is former actor Stephen Hart who was diagnosed in 2006. When he is too ill to leave the house, he also uses the food delivery service.Despite being high-risk and a life-long diabetic, Mr Hart has been helping to get food to those more vulnerable than him. He has been unable to work since his health deteriorated two years ago, but Mr Hart, who lives alone in south London, said he wanted to help others.How to support our campaign“When I feel well enough, I pick up boxes from River House and drop them off for people who need them,” he said. “I do it when I can but some days are bad days.”Mr Hart said his condition means sometimes he can’t get out of bed. He occasionally receives a Felix box for himself so he knows he has food when he is too sick to move. “It is reassuring to have food in the house,” he said. “Felix has been a lifeline.”Although the British HIV Association said there “remains no evidence” that people with HIV are at greater risk of Covid-19 infection, those with a low CD4 count – the white blood cells affected by HIV – have been advised to shield.Mr Hart said members of the HIV community have been “nervous” since the outbreak. “There isn’t much specific advice so the community has been trying to look after each other.”A 62-year-old living with HIV for 37 years, who asked not to be named, described how his parcels have helped him. He said: “I pick up the boxes as I don’t have energy to go shopping. They’ve been great.”Mr Hart said it was extremely moving to see the response to his deliveries: “It is amazing. Everyone is very grateful.”The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.Modern slavery victims are being deported to countries where they are at high risk of further exploitation because the Home Office is relying on a flawed interpretation of evidence, lawyers and researchers have warned.Guidance used by caseworkers to assess whether people trafficked to the UK can be sent back to Vietnam or Albania – the two most common nationalities for modern slavery victims in Britain – is “significantly misleading” about the risks, one told The Independent.The situation has “horrendous human consequences” if trafficking victims are refused asylum and returned to countries where they are unlikely to receive adequate protection.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGovernment figures show 1,705 Albanians were identified as potential modern slavery victims by the UK’s National Referral Mechanism (NRM) last year, making it the most commonly referred foreign nationality, while 887 referrals were of Vietnamese origin, making it the second-most commonly referred.Victims identified through the NRM can apply for asylum if they wish to remain in the UK due to fear of returning to the country from which they were trafficked.Record high 10,000 suspected modern slavery victims in UKPotential slavery victims to be deported on charter flight to PakistanHome Office leaves modern slavery victim ‘in limbo’ for five yearsHowever, a report published last month by Asylos, a charity that produces its own reports on country-of-origin information, found many victims were at serious risk of re-trafficking in Vietnam due to economic vulnerability, problems accessing social services, stigma and unpaid debts to traffickers.It also found that recognition by the NRM as a victim of trafficking would not automatically confer the same status with officials in Vietnam, making them potentially ineligible for assistance.The report included one example of a Vietnamese boy who was trafficked from the country twice, once to China, and then once to Laos for sex exploitation, before he was found in Poland.For Albania, the Home Office’s guidance makes almost no mention of boys and young men, which experts said leads to the impression that male victims do not face any issues that would entitle them to asylum in Britain.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailHowever, Aylos last year found boys and young men in Albania are being targeted for exploitation by groups associated with organised crime, some of which have links within the UK.Trafficking victims ‘left without access to justice’ under new rulesDavid Neale, legal researcher and formerly a barrister at Garden Court Chambers, told The Independent that the Home Office guidance on both Vietnam and Albania “painted the country of origin as able to protect the person adequately when that’s very often just fundamentally not the case”.He noted that the government’s assertion that victims were likely to be able to access effective protection from the state in Vietnam was “flatly contradicted” both by the Asylos report and by some of the information included in the Home Office’s own guidelines.“It’s wholly wrong to say that in general people are going to be able to avail themselves of sufficient state protection because in a lot of cases they’re just not. They’re not going to be recognised as trafficking victims at all, and whatever services might be available are just not going to be made available to them,” he said.“Sometimes the Home Office conclusions are significantly misleading. Yet they are presented as if they are evidence when the country summary is not evidence and is in my view extremely problematic and potentially very misleading and I think does mislead a lot of people.”Mr Neale said the “misconceived” guidance was part of a “culture of refusal” within the Home Office that he said was “set up to disbelieve people and to try and paint the country of origin as able to protect the person adequately when that’s very often just fundamentally not the case”.He said negative asylum decisions based on this guidance risked “absolutely horrendous human consequences” for the victims.“They’ll go to appeal, but if they’re unrepresented or not well represented, the judge may not be cognisant of all these issues around the Home Office narrative and they just accept the Home Office narrative, and they could end up in detention – they could end up removed,” he said.“Equally, they could end up living an underground life in the UK for a long period with no access to legitimate work or benefits, which obviously makes people extremely vulnerable to re-trafficking and abuse and labour exploitation.“And even if they’re able to get legal representation to appeal, people can be waiting months or years for their appeal, during which they’re likely to be on a minimal level of support – unable to work and claim mainstream benefits. And of course people throughout this period are vulnerable to re-trafficking.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Social distancing markers around the penguin enclosure at London Zoo.

Information notes are based on rigorous research, we work closely with other governments and organisations to prevent re-trafficking, and removals from the UK are only enforced when the courts and the Home Office conclude it is safe.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Does that make sense to you?”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Hunt said that he has been disappointed by the lack of progress on resuming lessons for primary school children, but refused to criticise his boss in Downing Street, instead blaming unions for their lack of cooperation.“Well I think that some of the largest teaching unions – such as the National Education Union – they haven’t been particularly productive and positive in the discussions,” said Hunt.“I have to be honest with you, I think the vast majority of those involved in education are motivated by what is in the best interests of the children.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“But unfortunately, I’ve come to the conclusion that there does seem to be many people, particularly those involved at senior levels in teaching unions, who seem to be more motivated by scoring political points than getting as many children as possible back to school.”Asked what evidence he had to back up his claim, the MP accused the National Education Union of “actively discouraging” teachers from conducting online lessons.Hunt was then asked by Derbyshire who exactly had made the comment, to which he replied: “I’ve got the quote...” but added that it was “not to hand”.Mr Hunt said that it will be children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds that suffer the most as a result of the continued closure of schools and reiterated that his passion for education.“Well do something about it then,” the presenter replied.Earlier this week, the government abandoned its pledge to get all primary school children back to class before the summer.Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce on Wednesday that zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas in England can join non-essential shops in throwing open their doors as part of the relaxation of the coronavirus lockdown on 15 June.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It has four core beliefs: family, integrity, teamwork and success – all integral pillars of its Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme.Put together by Sharon Gray OBE and the federation’s head teachers, it’s designed to welcome pupils back to class after lockdown. “Everybody in the Embark community has done their bit,” says Gray, a headteacher for 20 years, mostly in special schools supporting youngsters experiencing social, emotional and mental health difficulties and schools going through challenges.“It’s been all hands on deck,” executive headteacher and Trust leader of Embark’s schools Matthew Crawford adds. “Even two weeks into lockdown we were thinking about our children returning to school, whatever date that may be.”Safety at school1. Anyone who is unwell or been in contact with somebody showing coronavirus symptoms should stay away from schools, colleges and childcare settings2.

Help to minimise contact and mixing by altering classroom layout and timetablesWith regards to physical changes that parents and pupils can expect to see in corridors and classrooms, Embark is working with Government guidance and undertaking a thorough, bespoke risk assessment for each of its schools. “It can’t be a one-size-fits all approach,” Crawford stresses.According to Anna Upton – head of the 240-pupil Chaucer Junior School in Ilkeston, Derbyshire – questionnaires were sent out to reconnect with parents, through which they could express concerns and suggest ideas about the return to classrooms.According to Upton, staggered breaks and how drop-offs will work were important issues that were flagged in questionnaires. “But the risk assessment the Trust has put in has allowed us to make a comprehensive plan and we can communicate that to the parents,” she explains.“What the Trust have done with the programme is to implement nine stages which support our schools to open as safely as possible, supporting the staff parents and the children. The risk assessment means that I, as a headteacher, can do what’s right for my school.”Chair of trustees Sarah Armitage emphasises the importance of teamwork based around a guiding principle: families first. We look after families, so we reach out we talk.” she says.“Then there’s teamwork. Let’s harness the power of the team so it’s not the headteacher sitting by themselves with all these things to think about – that load is shared.”Armitage’s back-to-school outlook is optimistic too: “We have created something with this programme that we hope will be massively beneficial. Our role as leaders is to keep that going, carry on putting emotional needs at the heart of everything we do, because then children are able to learn and benefit – and move through this crisis.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

Please consider a contribution or subscription.China has removed pangolin parts from its list of traditional medicines, state-backed media reported, in a move campaigners say is a vital step in helping to protect the endangered animal.Pangolins – the world’s most trafficked mammal  – are highly sought after in China and Vietnam for their meat which is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional medicine and folk remedies.Similar in size to domestic cats and the only mammal covered in scales, all eight pangolin species are protected under international laws but there remains a growing illegal trade of the animals. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis week health authorities omitted pangolin scales from China’s latest Pharmacopoeia, an approved list of traditional drugs and remedies due to “wild resources exhaustion”, according to a report in the Health Times.WildAid CEO Peter Knights said the move was “the greatest single action that could have been taken to save pangolins from extinction.”“The increased protection coupled with the swift and comprehensive closure of live wildlife markets and removal of many wild species from the list of what can be consumed as food in China were already very positive steps to saving the pangolin worldwide and reducing the possibility of them ever being a vector for disease.“And now this announcement, effectively the closure of legal sales of pangolin scales, shutting the last major loophole in pangolin protection efforts,” he added.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) welcomed China’s decision, but urged action to stop the sale of pangolins on the black market. “PETA gives a nod to China for taking an important step to combat the demand for pangolin scales,” director Elisa Allen told The Independent.“However, as long as it remains desirable and profitable for endangered animals’ body parts to be sold for medicine, wildlife will continue to be killed on the black market.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some scientists believe they may incubate the Covid-19 virus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan last year and has since swept the globe.Scientists find virus similar to Covid-19 in pangolinsFollowing the outbreak of coronavirus at the end of last year, China banned the consumption of all wild animals in a bid to prevent further outbreaks but many wet markets have since reopened.Earlier this year, The Independent renewed its call for the banning of trade in wild animals to help protect endangered species and avoid future pandemics.“These actions of China will have a real impact, these are steps that were critical, that needed to be taken if real conservation was going to happen for these animals,” said David Olson, director of Conservation at WWF Hong Kong.“Most of the demand for pangolin is coming from traditional Chinese medicine and consumption. That’s what is driving this large scale illegal trade.”With additional reporting by Louise Boyle Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

What previously took a number of researchers a long time can now be accomplished by one drone operator in minutes.”The paper’s lead author Dr Andrew Dunstan, of the Queensland Department of Environment and Science, said: “Previous population survey methods involved painting a white stripe down the green turtle’s carapace when they were nesting on the beach, then getting on a small boat and counting painted and non-painted turtles.“Our eyes are attracted much more to a turtle with a bright white stripe than an unpainted turtle, but the pain washed off after a few days and the counting accuracy suffered.“Trying to accurately count thousands of painted and unpainted turtles from a small boat in rough weather was difficult. Using a drone is easier, safer, much more accurate and the data is permanently stored,” he added.Managing director of the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, Anna Marsden, congratulated the researchers and described the images produced by the drone as “extraordinary”.“Raine Island is the world’s largest green turtle nesting site and that’s why we’re working with our Raine Island Recovery Project partners to protect and restore the island’s critical habitat,” she said.“We’re taking action to improve and rebuild the island’s nesting beaches and building fences to prevent turtle deaths, all working to strengthen the island’s resilience and ensure the survival of our northern green turtles and many other species.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A delaying-the-inevitable tactic which meant, by the time Phil and Dennis’s tickets for the April  game between West Ham and Burnley arrived in mid May, the fixture was as dead as Dennis.A lucky escapeyou ask me.The day of reckoning, when it runs out of episodes, fast approaches, of course. For the duration of the outbreak, though, it’s been a biological miracle.Regulars have packed The Vic, mobbed the Bridge Street market and just stood around gawping and muttering, in their usual community-serving way, when Keegan’s sandwich van was trashed by the local drug dealers.The presence of a global pandemic hasn’t stopped EastEnders lecturing us about other medical issues, obviously.Since the boat party accident, in February, it’s been particularly concerned about Ben Mitchell’s deafness, which cut no ice with me for a couple of good reasons.Firstly, Ben Mitchell is a dreadful, immoral, six-headed little turd who it’s impossible to like, let alone love.Secondly, they’d forgotten he was partially deaf for most of the previous decade.There’s not an international crisis or continuity glitch in the universe that can stand in the way of EastEnders’ moral grandstanding, though, so they decided viewers should “see and hear” last week’s heist episode, with Barry Grant off Brookside, through the eyes and ears of Ben.A particularly gormless enterprise, this one, which went off like Norman Collier and Jimi Hendrix on the same bill at The Half Moon in Putney, and was all feedback and missing words.To ram home the message for the hard of thinking, the action was also accompanied by word cloud subtitles that appeared to have been written by Tarzan.“Keep mind on job.”“Cut power.”“Ben, this mistake.”“Daughter without father.”Compared with other EastEnders episodes, I enjoyed it a lot. I usually do when the show tries something a bit dferent and thought you could actually write the entire history of the show in half a dozen lines of this new Tarzan-speak.“Den hate Angie.” “Peter change head.” “Phil. Him shot.” “You not mother.” “Me am mother.” “Peter change head again.” “Get out pub.” It’d be timely as well. After  years and four months of almost constant shouting and stall-minding, EastEnders goes off air next week.Tantalisingly, The Sun’s very own Andy Halls reported, on Friday, that when it s the show will have dropped its old storylines. A dream scenario which allowed me to fantasise about EastEnders .. A happier, funnier show that’s only on twice a week, where the BBC doesn’t endlessly bask in its own right-on virtue and the majority of characters actually sound like Londoners, instead of stage-schooleditorials.But that’s not going to happen, is it So I’m just going to enjoy the silence. Tarzan like.TIPPING Point, Ben Shephard: “Which city in the Midlands shares its name with a meeting between two sporting rivals ”Bill: “Birmingham.”Celebrity Mastermind, John Humphrys: “In an th century poem, what season of the year did Keats describe as ‘a season of mists and mellow fruitfulness’ ”Monty Panesar: “Oliver Twist.”Ben Shephard: “The Anglo-Dutch wars were fought primarily between England and which modern-day country ”Amy: “Denmark.”.THE Last Leg, Desiree Burch on the George Floyd fallout: “Follow black artists and thinkers on social media, people who have good resources, information, opinions and insights. Right now I have two shows you could watch — Desiree’s Coming Early and Tar Baby.”Or you could watch Too Hot To Handle, where Netflix films young people having sex while artist thinker Desiree offers her “insights and opinions”.But she’s clearly too modest to mention her role on that one.THIS week’s winner is Tory MP Andrew Bridgen and Harry Enfield’s Tim Nice But Dim. Sent in by RJ.FIRST job for the Beeb’s new Director General, Tim Davie  Find out how Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer ended up on primetime, Saturday night, BBC. Seriously, how  It’s a late-night ITV show, with no one to bleep out the swearing, but with BBC levels of over-manning.The star, obviously, was Peter Crouch, who’s actually funnier than  per cent of TV comedians and more likable than all of them, but not yet ready to front his own show. So they added Maya Jama, who looked sensational in her Status Quo Blue For You-era denims, the compulsory Horne Section and Chris Ramsey, who was hiding behind a fence at the start. And should’ve stayed there. All deserve our sympathy. SOS was meant to be a Euro  spin-off and when the tournament vanished so did the show’s point. Camera angles also seem to have gone to hell, but that’s maybe an act of socially distanced mercy given what’s happening front and centre.Saturday’s content included: A teabag- flipping contest between Mo Farah and Ellie Simmonds, parachuting with Jermaine Jenas, which was straight off the Alan Partridge script and foul-mouthed football “bantz” from Rio Ferdinand, who said his career was ended by Peter Crouch, so may have been playing keepy-uppy to the Match Of The Day theme tune as some sort of twisted payback.The really alarming thing, though, is the series lasts eight weeks.Save Our Summer  At this rate, there’ll be a dark cloud hanging over autumn as well.For the record, it was the BBC News.SPRINGWATCH’s Steve Backshall wearing a “No planet B” T-shirt like he’s a -year-old student, rather than a -year-old BBC presenter who won’t shut up about his three kids. Bafta giving nominations to The Greatest Dancer and The Ranganation but not a Best Drama nod to Line Of Duty.This Morning’s Phillip Schofield losing his very short temper with John Torode over yoghurt dressing. Anyone who says “chowing down” instead of eating. And the clearly smitten GMB host Susanna Reid making an involuntary groping gesturewith her left hand, just after she says the name Keir Starmer. Easy tiger.PETER Crouch: “It wasn’t all about improving, it was also about getting better.”Ian Wright: “The one thing about Gerrard was his professionalism and the fact he was so versatile.”Paul Merson: “It was definitely half an open goal.”                                 SKY Documentaries’ McMillion, the best show on TV.Ralph’s wedding on The A Word. ITV’s th birthday tribute to the great Bradley Walsh.The GMB spat between Piers Morgan and Donald Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, which had everything except the obvious reprimand: “Rudy. Stop your messin’ around.”And Channel ’s Murder In The Outback, where disgraced Australian lawyer Andrew Fraser proves, beyond much forensic doubt, Bradley Murdoch did indeed kill Peter Falconio.The only slight glitch being, he’s trying to prove the exact opposite.Watch it, Channel , tonight and tomorrow, pm. The self-delusion becomes hypnotic. A Gillian Burke on Springwatch B Connell Waldron on Normal People C Comedian Tom Allen on nearly everything MOST surprising thing about Britain’s Best Parent  Anita Rani isn’t the most annoying person on this Channel  show.In fact, she’s not even close to a medal position thanks to the other five – two couples and a single mum – who must champion their own style of parenting, whether  it’s “pushy” or “vegan” or mollycoddling or just sort of lying around in bed all day treating their offspring as the hired help.Like the rest of us, Channel  silently understands, of course, listening to strangers talk about their small children is no more engaging or enlightening than listening to a ­scientologist talk about L. Ron Hubbard, so they’ve included a few eccentrics to liven  up the process.On the one hand there’s martial arts enthusiast Robin, who explains: “Our parenting style is influenced by eastern philosophy. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism,” ventriloquism, egotism, Roxette’s fourth album Tourism.On the other there’s gender fluid feminist nut Joana, who is attempting to bring up five-year-old son Willow as “a free spirit”, by banning the word “boy”, refusing to buy him “militaristic toys” and plastering her house in idiotic Socialist Worker propaganda.Hopefully, little Willow will be a stalwart of his local golf club and TA unit  in about  years’ time.But that’s no real saving grace for the show, nor a reason to watch any part of Britain’s Best Parent, apart from the final vote where, every week, the studio audience has to choose between those “free spirits” who let the kids rule the roost and those couples, like David and Nicky, who run their house more like an SAS boot camp.And every week, I’m happy to report, they vote for the boot camp.All hope for Britain may not be lost.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In her case, it’s not pretty.Where to start  How about son number two who, thanks to his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein is now embroiled in an ugly, cross-Atlantic ding dong with an American legal system that kowtows to no one.Clearly, Andrew hoped his royal status might ensure discretion. But the US Department of Justice has other ideas and has now publicly accused him of lying when he says he has offered to co-operate with their inquiries into Epstein’s questionable activities.It’s uncertain whether The Queen and Prince Philip have Netflix in their lockdown lair at Windsor Castle, butthey have watched the documentary Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich — in which their reportedly favourite son is mentioned many times — they will have spat out their popcorn.Aside from the well- documented claim by Virginia Roberts that she was trafficked to London at the age of  to have sex with Prince Andrew , one of the most damning accusations is the alleged sighting of him at Epstein’s private island where airport staff now say that the billionaire, who allegedly killed himself last year, frequently arrived with “underage girls”.Ordinary people staying schtum at the time for fear of losing their jobs is one thing but the silence of the many powerful men who enjoyed Epstein’s hospitality is quite another.Prince Andrew is undoubtedly one of them and, at the very least, he owes it to Epstein’s survivors to sit down with the US Department of Justice and reveal what he does, or doesn’t, know.And asthat’s not enough to give his mother sleepless nights, he and his ex-we Sarah Ferguson are also being sued for a £.million unpaid debt on a Swiss ski chalet.Meanwhile, son number oneis happy enough in his second marriage, but reportedly harbouring a deep sadness that one of his sons has chosen to leg it to the US, along with the baby grandson he can no longer hug.On top of that, he faces forking out millions to help Harry and Meghan pay for personal protection because not only have they chosen to settle down in paparazzi central, but in a country where the gun culture means any nutter can wander into a store and arm up as easily as buying a microwave.Son number threehas just announced that his children won’t use royal titles and will work for a living.But one wonders whether, given the pressure to streamline the monarchy, they jumped before they were pushed.Daughter Anne is a reliable stalwart, but grandson Peter recently announced his marriage to we Autumn is over, and as for grandsons William and Harry, it’s fair to say that the reported fall-out of those two young brothers who walked so stoically behind their mother’s coffin must be causing The Queen great sadness.So, with all that going on with her nearest and dearest, how will she feel when lockdown finally lts and she’s expected to put on a brave face to the world again Will she think, “I’ve had enough” and, as was rumoured prior to the pandemic, abdicate on her th birthday next year Doubtful, given that she pledged she would be of service “my whole le” and that, traditionally, British monarchs occupy the throne until death.But, given her family ructions, who could blame hershe did decide to call it a day If he had bodyguards with him on his ious visits to Epstein, then perhaps they could enlighten the US authorities on Andrew’s movements at the time Andhe didn’t, then why the hell does he need them now Asthe new, -day quarantine rule wasn’t daft enough, it’s emerged that police have been told to take “no immediate action”a passenger gives a  address on arrival in the UK.Right. So the only travellers affected by this ludicrous policy will be the law-abiding and public figures who risk being spotted on holiday then named and shamedthey don’t self-isolate upon .Everyone  can just give their details as Mickey Mouse of Taking The Mickey Street, and go about their le with impunity.Meanwhile, the airline industry is teetering on the verge of bankruptcy because it sends out the message that Britain is closed.Well.

roughly  per cent of Britains poorest kids had access to packages of material, compared to just over  per cent.But wealthy kids were iniably getting better access to crucial online classes - almost  per cent, compared to  per cent.For those in private school the number was even higher - almost  per cent of privately educated children were getting online classes.The report said: These gaps mean that children from better-off families are not only doing a higher quantity of home learning, they also have access to potentially higher-quality support from schools.The activities that children from better-off families are doing may also require less parental support because they involve a more active engagement from teachers and tutors.The report warned parents of poorer kids were more likely to be overloaded with helping their children as well as trying to work.The report added: It is almost certain that these factors will coalesce to widen an already prominent attainment gap between children from poorer and better-off background in England.According to the IFS this dference in schooling could entrench inequalities and scar kids careers long after finishing school.Children in poorer families have lost more from school closures, and those who would have entered work this year face the potential for long-term scarring from the collapsing labour market.In contrast, iniduals with higher levels of education and higher earnings are more likely to be able to carry out their work activities from their home, to have space at home to educate their children.And to have savings to cover any unforeseen expenditures.Schools have only just opened up this month after closing for everyone but children of key workers in March.Kids in reception, year one and year six are all able toto classes, but the Government recently ditched its plans to get all primary school kids back before the holidays.Childrens Commissioner Anne Longfield accused the Government earlier this week of prioritising the reopening of pubs of kids education.She told BBC Radio : Lets look at some of the things the Government has prioritised over recent months at vast scale and speed - the measures to save jobs, the ,-bed hospitals, propping up the economy.All of those things have happened in a way that is unimaginable.Its that level of will and determination thats needed to overcomer the practicality thats needed nowChildrens education does matter as much as the economy and we need to invest in it because without it theres the risk that childhood is going to be furloughed for months. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wanted to say the right thing and I was really nervous that it would get picked apart.“And I realised the only wrong thing to say is to say nothing.”Meghan referred to a teacher from the school, who she says gave her the courage to speak out.She said: I was thinking about this moment when I was a sophomore, I was ... it’s the year we do volunteer work.And I remember one teachers, Ms Pollia, said to me, ‘always remember to put other’s needs above your own fears’.That has stuck with me throughout my entire le and I have thought about it more in the last week than ever before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

an end to what was dubbed Boris bonking ban after measures prohibited people from seeing other people indoors.It means from Saturday lonely Brits will be able to choose one other person to include in their bubble so they dont need to social distance.The announcement also meansBut crucially, people wont be able to hop in and out of multiple homes - only the two people within the bubble.If any member of the bubble develops symptoms of coronavirus, everyone will have to self-isolate for  days as though they are in the same household.If others develop symptoms they should be tested too.Officials stressed earlier that the policy was separate to the rules which allow people to meet up in groups of six outside their own household in a park or garden - as long as they were two metres apart.The new rules rely on Brits behaving sensibly and wont require people to hand over details of who is in their bubble.Sources said the changes were to help single people who have largely been on their own throughout the pandemic.By allowing them to bubble up - including helping with childcare - it will provide them with extra support in such tough times.The Government has been looking at the bubble policy for months to seeit can help provide some easing to the lockdown rules.But as the R rate continues to teeter above one in some areas, there were fears that allowing large groups of people to mix would start to spread the virus quickly again. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-deaths-per-day-linegraph--jun-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   ac-graphic-UK-cases-per-day-linegraph--jun.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\"  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Millions of key workers across the supply chain have continued to work throughout this pandemic and are hidden heroes, keeping Britain fed.He added that manufacturers are fully engaged with a wide range of government-led initiatives designed to tackle the huge public health challenge of obesity.  FDF members’ voluntary work is already delivering substantial changes. Compared to four years ago, FDF member products contribute  per cent less calories,  per cent fewer sugars, and  per cent less salt to the average shopping basket.He said the government needs to invest money in specic measures to support people and areas that are most affected by obesity.We believe a whole lestyle approach will be most effective, focusing on how we achieve a balanced diet and keep active, and not on any single nutrient.” To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It went through three iterations before it came to be the one we recognize today that features a red banner, a blue St Andrews cross, and  white stars that represent the Confederate states. It was flown by several Confederate armies, including that lead by Robert E. Lee, who fought to protect slavery as an institution.The confederate flag has been used in the state since .

So we need a strategy. We need leadership, and we need an army of recruits.First, let’s not waste those upcoming summer weeks. There is no need for school to be out for summer.As the Children’s Commissioner Anne Longfield has said, \" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"our schools should be open in some form or other over the six-week summer holidays. We can’t afford to leave it all to the autumn and hope for the best.I am not trying to trap the wonderful teachers into another six weeks without a break. They have already been ­working flat out over the past three months, developing home- learning resources.I understand the practical as well as contractual concerns that need to be negotiated.But without overburdening, or ­risking anyone’s health — where there’s a will, there’s a way.There are teaching staff, ex-teaching staff, retired teaching staff and countless volunteers who I believe are ready and willing to step up and help supervise children under the leadership of professionals.Second, we need to think ­creatively about space.I am the leader of a group of  schools around the country.\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"There is just not enough space in any of our school buildings to properly social- ­distance and house all pupils at the same time.We are not alone here.So let’s use other empty buildings — village halls, town halls, hotel conference halls, church halls and closed museums. What great learning opportunities for “bubbles” — those small groups in which all children are taught now.Third, this moment gives us the opportunity to rethink what education is. If it’s true that we are community beings — that we learn in community from one another — then we need to rethink the curriculum.Education has always been about more than maths, English and geography.It is every little bit as much about social and emotional development.Human beings are social beings. We thrive when we are connected and struggle when we’re not. I talked to a GP who lives up our street and is the mother of an ­intelligent six-year-old boy. She told me last week about how concerned she is about him “becoming withdrawn”. She is right to be worried.We have to get used to the fact that “remote” learning will probably be part of the ­equation for the foreseeable future. So, once again, let’s think dferently.Let’s use the days when children are in school with us dferently to the days when they are at home.Leave the academic subjects for days when they can work at home on projects we have set them the day before. While they are with us, concentrate on team-building and emotional and social skills development, making up for the deficit they have suffered through ­lockdown.Through the summer, let’s use lots of play and sports for the same purpose, along with those “catch-up” lessons. We are all going to have to learn how to balance intelligently “remote” home-learning with the “togetherness” opportunities of classroom learning.In a survey by PiXL — a ­national partnership of primary and secondary schools —  per cent of teachers questioned believed the Covid- crisis presents us with an opportunity for root-and-branch reform of educational methodology.So let’s start now.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We couldn’t believe our eyes.”She said after first picking up the item to see what it was, Kane immediately put it down safely and they called the police. Experts from the British Army’s Royal Logistic Corps arrived at the house in Blackpool, Lancs, on Tuesday evening and had to evacuate homes.Ellie said: “It was crazy. One minute we’re cleaning out the shed and the next minute we’re being told to leave our homes because a bomb could potentially go off. Kane was so careful when he put it back in case it exploded.“While we waited for police and bomb disposal experts to arrive, we went out into the street and were chatting to neighbours about it. Everyone was really shocked. We were told to all move to the other side of the street just to be on the safe side.The pair, who have only been dating for a few months, joked that their first photograph together was next to a bomb. Ellie, who lives with her nan Hayley Wilkinson, , said: “I must admit, it’s a good tale to tell.

Pick For Britain is a national campaign, bringing workers and employers together to match skills and need to help save the farming industry. The campaign brings all recruiters and those seeking work in one place, from pickers and packers, to plant husbandry and tractor or forklt drivers. Pick for Britain is the perfect chance to pass the summer months and earn moneyyou’re a university student, a way to continue workingyou’re on furlough and a great way to meet new people and be part of an extraordinary national effort to get seasonal food on people’s plates. One British worker who has signed up to work is Lucy, who lives in London. She was travelling in sub-Saharan Africa when the coronavirus crisis began to unfold so ed home and is now doing her bit to Britain in the need for food.

I would % recommend it to somebody . I’m having a really good time, the people are really nice, and it’s nice to be out in the open air and doing something physical. Though the work can be demanding, farm work is currently considered key work and it’s a healthy and productive way to support local communities during this dficult time. You usually need to be at least  years old to work on a farm, but there may be roles for  to -year-olds depending on the business and for most roles previous experience is not required, with training given by the farms. Ideally farms are looking for people who can work a full working week but days and hours can y by farm and according to the weather.  Pay depends on your employer and the job you do.

Speaking at the Downing Street press conference Professor Chris Whitty shared his biggest regret in the Governmentaposs response to the crisis so far. Asked directly about what their biggest regret was, Boris Johnson dodged the question. But Professor Whitty pointed to the slow development of Britainaposs testing regime. The Chief Medical Officer said: I think there is a long list, actually, of things that we need to look at very seriously. If I was to choose one, it would probably be looking at how we could ... speed up testing very early on in the epidemic. Many of the problems that we have had came because we were unable to actually work out exactly where we were. Professor Whitty added it was important to learn lessons from what had happened in the outbreak. He warned there was a reasonable chance that the virus would have certain advantagesthere was a second wave in the winter. It is something that transmits more easily indoors and therefore things that are working well in summer and autumn may cease to be working as well in winter, he said. The nature of new epidemics is very often they come in waves circling around the world andwe get hit by another wave, at that point we need to understand better what is the optimal mix of things we could do.It came after a former top Government advisor said Britainaposs coronavirus death toll could have been halvedlockdown was introduced a week earlier.Britain has an official death toll from confirmed COVID- cases of over ,, rising to over , cases when deaths from suspected cases are included.Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduced the lockdown on March .Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, who had to step down from scientic advisory group SAGE after breaking lockdown to meet a woman with from another household, told MPs that the UK had taken the right measures against Covid- but too late. He told the Science and Technology Committee: The epidemic was doubling every three to four days before lockdown interventions were introduced. So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have then reduced the final death toll by at least a half.  He went on: So whilst I think the measures ... were warranted ... certainly had we introduced them earlier, we would have seen many fewer deaths. At the No  briefing Mr Whitty declined to be drawn on a claim by Professor Neil Ferguson that the death rate could have been cut by halfthe country had gone into lockdown a week earlier. I think a iety of dferent people are going to come with dferent answers on the timing question, he said. Part of the problem that we had at that stage is that we had very limited information about this virus.

A single-adult household can form a bubble with one other household and act as though they live together, permanently. It means two households can finally break the two-metre rule to meet, laugh and love for the first time in almost three months. And some separated couples can finally reunite for overnight stays and sex. Boris Johnson announced the shake-up tonight as he unveiled separate changes from June  - including re-opening non-essential shops and zoos. It will be valuable respite to millions whose mental health has been stomped on by lockdown. But critics may warn itaposs far too soon as the UK still notches up hundreds of deaths per day. And the policy is strictly limited to certain situations - with other lockdown rules very much continuing as planned. That means it will leave some bizarre loopholes and many people will feel theyaposre left out. Meanwhile, million people who are shielding will be unable to benefit from forming a bubble with another household, for their own protection. Boris Johnson admitted people will find “anomalies” in “what people can and cannot do” - but that is “just inevitable”. So what exactly has been announced, who can benefit and how  Hereaposs a full explanation. What has Boris Johnson announced   From one minute past midnight this Saturday  June, two separate households in England will be allowed to join together in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors, stay the night and even have sex for the first time since March . “All of those who are in a support bubble will be able to act asthey live in the same household,” a No spokesman confirmed. It will be the first time in three months that dferent households have been given permission to break the two-metre social distancing rule. But there are strict conditions to this and it does not apply to all households.  One of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. That means a person living alone cannot form multiple bubbles with multiple households. Likewise, a family cannot form multiple bubbles with more than one lonely relative. Where does the policy apply  Only in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland form their own rules.  Do both households have to be people living alone  No. Only one of the two households being joined together needs to be a “single-adult household”. As long as one household in a bubble fulfils this criteria, the other household is not limited in size.  No. “You can’t switch the household you’re in a bubble with or make a connection with multiple households,” a No spokesman said. This is because it would create chains of transmission that spread the virus through the community. Can aposshieldedapos people form a bubble   No. The million or so people in England who have been told to shielding because they are “extremely clinically vulnerable” cannot form a bubble. They are still advised to keep two metres apart from other households and avoid all social contact - advice which will last at least until June . They can leave the house, but only with members of their own household - orthey live alone, to meet one member of another household from m away. This is likely to create fresh frustration for the millions whoaposve been trapped indoors for medical reasons, living under dferent rules to the rest of the country. A No spokesman said: “Unfortunately we can’t advise anyone who is shielding to form a household bubble. “We do know how hard it is for people who are shielding and we’re keeping the advice under close review, but we’re not able to advise today that they could form a bubble.” Who will this help - and who won’t it help  HELPED: A widow aged  can go round her daughter’s house to stay with her daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren. NOT HELPED: Two married grandparents, aged  and , can’t visit their daughter’s house to stay with their daughter, son-in-law and three grandchildren. HELPED: A single mum can go stay with her mum and dad to help with childcare. NOT HELPED: Married parents can’t go stay with the we’s mum and dad to help with childcare. HELPED: A -year-old man who lives alone in a bedsit can go stay with both his parents, who are married and live together. NOT HELPED: A -year-old man who lives in a house-share can’t go stay with his parents, who are married and live together. HELPED: A -year-old man who lives with his mates can stay the night with his -year-old girlfriend, who lives alone in her own flat. NOT HELPED: A -year-old man who lives with his mates can’t stay the night with his -year-old girlfriend, who lives with her mates too. HELPED: A lonely widow who wants to reunite with her -year-old daughter can have her round for the night. NOT HELPED: A lonely widow who wants to reunite with her -year-old daughter and -year-old son has to pick one of them to have round for the night. Whatboth sets of grandparents want to come and stay   Then you have a problem. The rules clearly state each household can only have a bubble with one other household. That meansyour maternal grandma and paternal grandma both live alone, and both want to see you… you have to pick one of them. One of them can form a “bubble” with you, come over, hug, eat and stay the night for months to come. The other one you have to see from two metres away in the park or garden. So it won’t help everyone  No. A No spokesman said: “We fully understand this isn’t going to help everyone, but it is a very targeted intervention there to support those who have been particularly isolated by the lockdown.” He added: “We know there are many lonely or isolated people as a result of the pandemic and the lockdown which has been in place and that is a particularly signicant issue for those people who live by themselves. “So we’re making this change to provide those people with additional support.” Does this affect current rules on meeting outside  No. This policy is separate to other current rules in England, which say you can meet in groups of up to six outdoors in a socially distanced way. That rule is unaffected by this new policy which is designed to let people meet indoors. How far away can each household in a bubble be  There is no limit - as long as it’s in England. The government asks people to stay local wherever possible, but understand there will be instances where they can’t do that. You don’t have to move in with the household you’ve formed a bubble with. Whatsomeone in the bubble gets sick  Once you’ve joined together in a “support bubble”, you must treat the rules as though you’re all in the same household. That means the moment one of you develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the support bubble must start self-isolating for  days. Will I be punished for setting up two bubbles at once   No. It will be taken on trust, like many of the other more complex lockdown rules. People will not have to fill out forms telling the authorities who they are forming a bubble with. What about children of orced parents  It remains the case that parents who are separated can continue to move children between households and share the care. These households are not prohibited from setting up support bubbles under the system. Put another way, the children of separated parents could potentially be in two support bubbles at once - one bubble for each parent. So does this all mean the end of the sex ban  "},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer blasts ridiculous situation","story":"NewsKeir Starmer blasts ridiculous situation of betting shops opening as schools stay shutLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has torn into the government again over its management of reopening schools after it was confirmed that not all primary school pupils willbefore summerShareCommentsByPatrick Daly:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsFamilies around the UK are wondering when back to school will be a reality [file pic]\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sir Keir said the issues facing Downing Street on ensuring pupils were safe toto classrooms were entirely foreseeable and criticised the Prime Minister for failing to meet with opposition parties to put together a plan. There was no plan, no consensus, no leadership, he said in an article for the . Sir Keir said leaving children at home would be damaging not only to their learning but also their welfare. He said: We now have the ridiculous situation where next week betting shops and theme parks will open, but parents are not clear when their children will go back to school. The longer schools are shut, the greater the damage to childrenaposs wellbeing and education and the increasing pressure on parents who are having to juggle childcare and work commitments. The warning from the Childrenaposs Commissioner a few days ago could not have been starker: a generation of children now risk losing out on over six months of education. Bookmakers and non-essential shops are reopening on Monday providing they can safely stick to social distancing guidelines. The criticisms follow on from Sir Keiraposs pointed comments during Prime Ministeraposs Questions, during which he told Boris Johnson that parents had lost confidence in the Governmentaposs schools plan and warned that millions of children could miss six monthsapos worth of education.It is being reported that Boris Johnson is considering dropping the hotly-contested two metre social distancing rule over the summer to free schools to reopen by September.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson was forced to admit defeat this week over plans - set out in the Governmentaposs coronavirus recovery plan - for primary schools to fully reopen.Children in nursery, Reception, Year  and Year  in England began ing to primary school last week after the Government eased lockdown measures. But some schools said they did not have enough space on site to admit all pupils in the eligible year groups, while adhering to Government guidance to limit class sizes to  and encourage fewer interactions. At the Downing Street press conference on Wednesday, Mr Johnson acknowledged he was moving slower than we would have liked in some areas - but he said he wanted all pupils back in classrooms by September. But Sir Keir said that target was in danger of being misseda plan was not put in place soon. Without a plan, there is a risk that even by September many schools will not be able to reopen, and some children could be out of education for an entire year, the former director of public prosecutions said. He argued that creativity needed to be used to utilise the empty buildings across Britain, including theatres, museums and libraries, so they could be repurposed as makesht classrooms.

From midnight on Saturday June , single people living alone in England will be allowed to join together with one other household in a “support bubble” under certain conditions. They won’t need to follow the two-metre rule - meaning they can hug, kiss, share childcare and meals, hang out indoors and stay the night for the first time since March . This means some grandparents who have been separated from their loved ones for months can finally re-unite. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    However, it doesnapost apply to everyone. A grandparent who lives alone would be able to form a bubble with the household of one of their children, which means they could see them and interact with their grandchildren as normal. But it will not apply to grandparents who live together because one of the two households in each bubble must be a “single-adult household”. This means either a person who lives alone, or a single parent who lives with children under . So grandparents who live together will only be able to see their grandchildrenthey are living with a single parent. The other household they are joining with can be of any size, and can have more than one adult in it. However, in total, each bubble must only consist of two households - and each household must keep the arrangement “exclusive”. This means some grandparents living alone will have to choose between their children and grandchildren that are old enough to no longer live with their parents until restrictions are eased further. Single people living alone will be able to see both their grandparents, but they will then be unable to see any other members of the family as the bubbles must be exclusive.Households with more than one adult can still not mix with one another without observing social distancing and staying outside. Meanwhile, the two million or so people in England who have been told to shield because they are “extremely clinically vulnerable” cannot form a bubble. So grandparents that fall into that category cannot take advantage of the new relaxation, eventhey live alone. The shielded are still advised to keep two metres apart from other households and avoid all social contact - advice which will last at least until June . They can leave the house, but only with members of their own household - orthey live alone, to meet one member of another household from m away.

Chloe Lloyd was driving home from her motheraposs with her eight-year-old daughter Lexi when her Vauxhall Astra left the road and crashed into a tree. She was speaking on a hands-free mobile to her boyfriend Domenico Gugliemucci when he heard a scream before the line went quiet. A worried Mr Gugliemucci rang Miss Lloydaposs mother Emma, who then drove in search of the -year-old and found her daughteraposs body and seriously injured grandchild.  Nurse who died with Covid- developed symptoms after sitting with positive patient Reading out Mr Gugliemucciaposs statement at the Bournemouth inquest, coroner Rachael Grfin said: Chloe said words to the effect of aposhow are you, and you sound tired apos He replied he was fine and asked hershe was driving back from her mumaposs  At which point he heard a scream from Chloe and then other distorted sounds. Then it went quiet, with the only sound the indicators. Miss Lloyd was pronounced dead at the scene on the A at Upton, Poole, Dorset, on January . Her daughter continues to recover from her injuries under the care of her grandparents after receiving emergency treatment in hospital. On the day of the tragic crash, the inquest heard Miss Lloyd had spent time with her mother and daughter before a meal with her father, Martyn. She was last seen alive at around .pm when she set off to drive home. Around  minutes later her parents received the devastating call from Mr Gugliemucci.  A statement from Miss Lloydaposs mother was also read out at the inquest. In the statement Mrs Lloyd said: After the meal Chloe and her father were messing about and joking with one another, as they usually did. She was happy and content and making plans for the future. A post mortem examination show Miss Lloyd, who held a driving licence for  years and had no endorsements, died from multiple injures. Further tests showed she had no alcohol or drugs in her system, and did not have any underlying health conditions. A police investigation found the car had no mechanical defects and that all four tyres were in a serviceable condition. Miss Lloydaposs mobile phone was in her handbag inside the car, connected to her hands-free system via bluetooth, police found. No other vehicles were involved in the collision and witness statements said that Miss Lloydaposs car just lost control, spun around and then careered off the carriageway and collided with the tree. Road conditions were good and police found no evidence of any object in the carriageway or even any animal in or by the side of the road.  Ms Grfin said: Iaposm satisfied from all the evidence before me that the cause of her death is as the result of injuries that Miss Lloyd sustained in a road traffic collision. Following a thorough investigation by Dorset Police they did not find any reason why Miss Floydaposs vehicle left the carriageway that day. She was not driving at excessive speed. There is no physical evidence to account for why her vehicle left the carriageway that day. I know that Chloe was on the phone, but it is clear she was acting within the law and using a hands-free device to make that call. That phone call was very short, her phone was found within her bag - so there was no evidence to suggest she had handled that telephone to make a call.

For the last two months, Natalie and four other volunteers have been forced to survive almost without any aid in one of the worldaposs most remote locations. Natalie and her fellow volunteers were due to be rescued on May  but were left devastated again when their boat was cancelled after Thailand extended its lockdown. The scuba er instructor, who should be back in Devon by now and working as a summer school teacher, is hopeful another boat will arrive to collect them later this month. However, her visa has expired and no new ones are being issued while the coronavirus pandemic holds the world in its grip. Natalie said: The hardest thing for me has been not knowing how long weaposre going to be here. Itaposs kind of up and down, weaposre a very small group of people and weaposre living in a very confined, close situation. In the back of our minds is obviously families back home and stuff, which adds to the tension a little bit. Weaposre just trying to take things day by day. But for now, the tiny group have had to do what they can to survive, using washed up bits of plastic to make their rainforest camp. They share the island with scorpions, snakes, mouse-deer, wild boar, monitor lizards, and slow lorises, and have to forage for most of their food, including yams, jackfruit and other vegetation. There have been sporadic deliveries by boat of food staples, including rice and pasta. But the group are conscious they have to make sure these last as they donapost know when the next one will arrive - and there have been plenty of days where they have gone hungry. Natalie said: We have to be very aware of how much we consume, we are eating very basic food and really having to make it last. Despite the desperate situation the group, which is made up of two women and three men from England, Hungary, Canada, Malaysia and France, find themselves in - they are not totally alone. There is one resort on Kyun Pila, Awei Pila, which is a  minute dinghy sail away and where they can access water, showers and accomodation on portable cabins, as well as a patchy wi signal. This has proved a leline for Natalie, who is concerned for her -year-old father, who lives in Poole in the UK. But the group, who are volunteers with environmental group Ocean Quest Global, have had to adapt quickly to spending so much extra time on the island. Their jungle camp has been constructed from washed up plastic, with each person living in a hut made from bamboo, rice sacks and bottles. They have even managed to erect furniture in their new Robinson Crusoe-inspired le, have dug a well, a fire pit and place to wash.The volunteers have also started planting their own vegetables. There are other challenges for the small group, existing in such extreme circumstances. Natalie explained: Usually in a programme like this there is a regular change of volunteers, which keeps things fresh and interesting, but the other three volunteers have been with each other a long time now and relationships are strained at times. Communal living is always a challenge because you get so little personal space and have to compromise a great deal. One person’s negative attitude or bad mood will affect everyone. The group has been forced to adapt to their change in circumstances, with people learning to hack jungle trails, drive a dingy and build with bamboo. Natalie has earned herself the nickname Trash Squirrel by spending her days combing the beach for washed up waste that can then be put to use to build the structures theyaposre calling home and to be turned into useful tools for surivival. But as spring slowly turns into summer Natalie and her fellow volunteers are facing a new challenge - the tropical rainy season. Already the clouds are coming in faster and the first few drops of rain have started to fall. They are working to do all they can to ensure they are as ready as possible for when the downpours do come.  However, Natalie is still hopeful that a rescue boat will come for them before the rainy season begins in earnest. She says it has also been a useful time for getting to know herself better. Natalie explained: I learned that no matter how Zen and chilled I had thought I was, in moments of solitude and dficult moments of physical and mental tiredness, I still lose control and stop being mindful and calm. That no matter how friendly and cheerful I usually am, when I am locked down on a relatively small island with strangers, I become moody, grumpy and little motivated.

With just one week left for submissions to the ‘Hold Still’ competition, Kate urged the public to send in their pictures to add to , already submitted. The images are asked to represent the three core themes of the project - Helpers and Heroes Your New Normal and Acts of Kindness.The Duchess, , hopes the collection which will form part of a virtual exhibition with the National Portrait Gallery of which she is patron will symbolise the nation’s mood and feelings during the coronavirus crisis.In a video message to encourage more entries, Kate said: “There have been so many amazing entries to Hold Still over the last few weeks. “From families up and down the country showing how they are adapting to le during lockdown, through to some of the most amazing NHS and social care staff who are putting their lives on the line to save the lives of others. “But it isn’t too late to take part. “So please take a moment to capture what le is like for you, because together I hope that we can build a lasting illustration of just how our country pulled together during the pandemic.” Some of the submitted images include one titled Two Sleeping Colleagues Unmasked by Jane Roe - showing two exhausted nurses on the coronavirus front line, wearing intensive care branded unorms, asleep on a sofa. Another called Working From Home by Rosangela Borgese features a man with his back to the camera sitting at a computer while in the foreground a toddler lies sprawled on the ground surrounded by toys. One image chosen by Kate to highlight the project is of a hospital worker decked out in full PPE holding a newborn baby, titled Le Goes On by Matthew Williams. Another titled Glass Kisses by Steph James shows a young child looking at a grandparent through a window pane due to social distancing measures. Launched by the Duchess in collaboration with the National Portrait Gallery last month, Hold Still aims to create a collective portrait of lockdown in the UK, capturing the spirit, mood, hopes, fears and feelings of the nation as we continue to deal with the coronavirus outbreak. Anyone can submit their own photographs until pm on Thursday June  via the National Portrait Gallery website www.npg.org.uk hold-still Participants are encouraged to provide a short written statement to outline the experiences and emotions of those depicted in their photograph. One hundred shortlisted portraits will then be selected to feature in a gallery without walls – a one of a kind digital exhibition open to all. Each image will be assessed on the emotion and experience it conveys rather than its photographic quality or technical expertise.A senior palace source said: The Duchess has been inspired by many of the amazing feats accomplished by so many people that have brought Britain together. From incredible fundraiser Captain Tom to the daily bravery of our NHS workers. The overriding aim of the project is to bring together an unofficial national archive of the crisis, what has touched our everyday lives, the heroes behind the stories and images.

The disturbing incident took place hours after he brutally attacked her in a jealous rage after she innocently hugged another man, she told the Mirror. She claims he repeatedly slammed her head against a wall in the ladies toilets of the Algarve bar where she worked - leaving her a bloodied mess. When the woman ed home she had a “horrible feeling” someone was inside and found Brueckner under her bed. The -year-old believes the German was lying in wait to attack hershe brought another man back to her studio flat. But instead Brueckner, then aged in his late s, chillingly stared at her and said “goodbye” before fleeing.  She said he then embarked on a stalking campaign against the petite barmaid, leaving her too afraid to walk home alone. Portuguese police were twice called out to deal with Brueckner after she complained of the attack and stalking - but he was never charged. The  break-in has eery similarities with Madeleine’s disappearance two years later in nearby Praia da Luz, where he was living. Gerry McCann previously said he believed her abductor was hiding behind a door when he went to check on her. Investigators believe the person who took Madeleine broke into their holiday apartment through a window. The woman, who is still too scared of Brueckner to reveal her identity, today reveals her account of her relationship with the Madeleine suspect.  She tells the Mirror how the German: • Seduced her when they worked together waiting tables in an Algarve restaurant. • Flew into jealous rages when other men paid her attention or even spoke to her. • Branded her a “lazy Brit” when she refused his demands to clean his house. • Chillingly broke into her flat through an open window and hid under the bed after a bust-up. • Now believes her ex, who is in a German prison, could be responsible for Madeleine’s abduction. She said: “Until now I’ve refused to believe someone I was involved with could commit such a horrible and disgusting thing like hurting a child. “But I’m not sure anymore. I’m starting to wonderhe did do it. Andhe did, he needs to be really punished for it.  “It’s chilling to think my ex is suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann. I can’t cope with it.” The woman, from Berkshire, moved to the Algarve town of Lagos in late  after spending several years in the Netherlands. She landed a job in the Taberna de Lagos restaurant - now called Sal e Companhia - alongside Brueckner, a waiter who was two years her junior. “At first I didn’t actually like him that much,” she recalled in a softly-spoken southern accent. “Not for any reason, I just didn’t like him. “I was , he was a couple of years younger than me. Everyone called him Chris. “He liked me, I knew he liked me in ‘that’ way but I wasn’t interested. We slowly became friends in the spring of . “Chris could be very, very charming, very funny and very smooth in the way he talked. “He always dressed nicely, holding the door open for women, that kind of thing. “I was alone here in Portugal, no family around and a bit lonely and I was getting all this attention from this guy. “We got together romantically and at first it was great. The relationship was very nice.” The woman stayed over regularly at Brueckner’s rented farmhouse on the outskirts of Praia da Luz, less than a mile from the Ocean Club.  “I was living in a little flat by myself on the same road as the restaurant where we worked,” she said. “He was living in Luz in the house that has been on the news all week. He was living on his own. “He wasn’t sleazy in the beginning, he was very charming, even chivalrous. “He drove the nice car - the black Jaguar - and was very gentlemanly and spoke properly. “Our sex le was normal. He wasn’t into anything weird with me. “We used to go out to eat a lot. He wasn’t a veggie. He liked to eat Indian food. “He also liked German food. I remember in his house once he made strange German food that I didn’t like at all. “He liked taking me to the beach. He didn’t like the town beach in Lagos. It would always be the West coast beaches, the isolated ones. “He liked those because he didn’t like lots of crowds, that’s what he said. He didn’t like all the tourists in the summer. “At first he seemed very easy-going, very relaxed, but gradually after summer things changed. “During the summer it was good, but during the winter it started to get not so good.” Her first inkling that things were not right came when she bumped into a male friend in Lagos in late .  “We were chatting and suddenly he stopped talking to me, like he was spooked or suddenly remembered something,” she said. “Someone later told me Christian had previously threatened the guy because he’d seen us speaking before. “We also started to argue in the late autumn, early winter. “It would be small things. He would get angry about really small things and I would get upset. “I remember he lost it once because I didn’t clean his house. I said ‘I’ve got my own house to clean, I don’t live here.’ “He was like, ‘You should clean my house, you’re a woman’. “He said he had two Portuguese girlfriends before me and they both cleaned his house even though they never lived there. “I remember saying, ‘but I’m not Portuguese’, and he replied saying ‘English women are all lazy’. “He said he had seen an English girl for a little while and she was lazy like me. “He called her Carol, I think it was only for a few weeks, she was on holiday and they had a fling. “He started to get possessive but it wasn’t to my face, it was behind my back.  “He also began going back and forwards to Germany over that time. He’d stay one week in Germany, then back to Portugal. “I remember feeling suspicious, like something strange was going on, so I looked at his phone. “I found messages in German from someone called ‘B’ saying ‘Ich liebe dich’ - I love you. “It was a German number, and obviously he had been going back and forth to Germany, so I put two and two together. “I confronted him about those and he went crazy, completely crazy. We had a huge fight.” Worse was to come weeks later when Brueckner flew into his jealous rage at theBar - now called Little Breakfast - in the early hours of New Year’s Day. “I started New Year’s Eve working in Taberna de Lagos and then after midnight I worked at another bar,” she recalled. “Chris was at the bar and was drunk. “Some really nice guys I’d made friends with came in from the bar next door to say happy New Year and gave me a hug. “Chris just suddenly came round the bar in a crazy rage and dragged me out in front of everybody. “He grabbed me by the neck, pulled me into the girls toilets and was ramming my head against the wall. “There were people pulling him off me, I think it took four big guys to get him off me.  “They called the police and some officers came. I was on the floor and couldn’t move because I was in shock. “I didn’t talk to the police because I was scared of what he would doit meant he got arrested. “The police soon left after I said I didn’t want to deal with them. “I stayed there the rest of the night recovering and eventually two friends, a guy and his girlfriend, walked me back to my flat. “I went through the security gate and up two flights of stairs, into my flat and closed the door. “Something was really strange inside there. It’s hard to explain, something just felt strange. “I went into the bathroom and the toilet seat was up. I always put the toilet seat down, it’s what I do, so it was another clue. “I was sure someone was either in there or had been in there. “I started looking in the cupboards and then thought I’d check under the bed. “I peeked under and got the shock of my le. He was hiding under there, lying on his back, staring at me. “Can you imagine how that felt  I just froze. I didn’t know what he was going to do to me. “He got out from under the bed, acted like everything was normal, said goodbye to me, walked out and closed the door behind him. “I was there all alone, just shaking and shaking. “I think he was there waiting to see whether I brought anyone home with me. “To this day I still wonder what would have happenedI had brought someone back that night.  “I think, from the previous behaviour, he would have really, really hurt that person and me too.” Despite the vicious beating and break-in, she enraged her friends by rekindling their relationship weeks later. “A lot of people were very, very angry that I went back to him after what had happened on New Year’s Eve,” she admitted. “He begged for my forgiveness, saying he lost control because he was drunk and would not drink again. “He wasn’t a big drinker when we were together, so stupidly I believed him and we got back together with him. “But it was never the same.” The final straw came in mid- when she found women’s underwear in a bag belonging to Brueckner. “I found a pair of knickers that weren’t mine and I got really, really upset about that,” she said. “I confronted him about it at his place and again he went totally crazy. “He drove me back to Lagos. I got out of his car and that was it as far as I was concerned.” But Brueckner had other ideas and began stalking his ex and staking out the restaurant where she worked. “We had to call the police because he kept trying to get in,” she said. “He was stalking me constantly. “One day I was carrying a big tray of drinks and because I wouldn’t talk to him he knocked them out of my hand and they went everywhere. “The police were called and he was banned from coming inside.  “So he would wait outside and follow me. Sometimes it would be begging me to go back with him. “But other times it would be him threatening me or saying I’m going to find out where your parents are and do something to them. “People had to walk me home each night. There was someone each night. Eventually it stopped but it went on for a long while.” She told how Brueckner had a string of ‘relationships’ with older women that led her to believe he could be a gigolo. “There was one lady he used to take out to dinner sometimes, she was a bit older, and he said it was just for company,” she said. “There was another lady, she was much older and I think there may have been something going on between them. “He used to walk her dog and clean her apartment - at least that’s what he told me - and she gave him money for that. “She lived in the centre of town. He took me to her house a couple of times, to see her dog. “He used to go to people’s houses a lot, saying he was going to visit this person and that person. “But the more I think about it the more I wonder what  he was doing. “At the end of the day I never found out who the other underwear belonged to, or who ‘B’ was. “A friend of mine said to me she wonderedhe was some sort of gigolo, doing things for money with older women. “Looking back on it maybe I was very, very naive at that time. I was a lot younger, a lot more impressionable.” The woman moved on with her le but was stunned to get a visit from Portuguese police officers last year. They quizzed her about a rape Brueckner carried out on an American pensioner in Praia da Luz in , shortly after they split. But they never mentioned the Madeleine McCann investigation - even though British and German police already suspected his involvement. “I remember the Madeleine case. I remember being here in Portugal when it happened,” she said. “At first I thought they would find her, but they didn’t and then it became bigger and bigger. “The Portuguese police have spoken to me three times in the past year, but never once did they say it was about Madeleine. “They said it was about him, they were investigating him because they had found out he had raped an old lady in Luz in . “They wanted to know all about him. But I had no idea it was to do with Madeleine also. “They asked me what the relationship was like, what the sex le was like, how he treated me, how he treated women.

Jake Dimmick and Andrew Deluen were walking along a street in Seaton Delaval, Northumberland together when the latter was hit by two cars going in opposite directions.Mr Deulen suffered terrible injuries which killed him, Chronicle Live reported.One of the drivers of one of the cars stopped and called the emergency services. While he did Dimmock jumped into one of the strangeraposs cars and fled the scene, driving dangerously and crashing into a garden wall, Newcastle Crown Court heard. He spoke to his mum about the horric event he had witnessed before calling the police and confessing to what he had done. Neil Pallister, prosecuting, said that when officers turned up, he was visibly upset. The lawyer told the court: He explained he needed to go home to see his mother and he described quite graphically the terrible injuries that had been sustained by his friend. He explained how his friend had been run over and had clearly suffered a terrible head injury. He said aposI needed to come home and see my mamapos. The two men were walking together at about am on January  on a section of road which had no footpath. The driver of one, a Vauxhall Insignia, stopped and called the emergency services. While he was out of his car, Dimmick, who was upset and agitated, got into the Vauxhall, which had a shattered windscreen, and drove off. The car was spotted by a PC in a police car and it failed to stop when signalled to do so.  Dimmick then drove at speeds of up to mph in a residential mph zone during a chase lasting around three minutes. As he tried to make a right hand turn in Newsham, Blyth, he lost control due to his excessive speed and collided with a low garden wall. The car ended up in the front garden and Dimmick ran off. At .am, he called the police to report he had been involved in the crash. Officers went to his home at Elm Trees, Blyth, which is where he gave the account of what had happened to his friend. Dimmick, who has  previous convictions, including for robbery in  and theft in , pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking, dangerous driving, failing to stop, having no insurance, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and failing to provide a specimen. He has been in custody since January but none of it counts towards his sentence as he was recalled on licence from his previous sentence.  Judge Christopher Prince said the circumstances were extraordinary but that dangerous driving needs to be deterred. The judge ruled that the public would be better protected by a suspended sentence with requirements than a prison term lasting several months. Dimmick was sentenced to six months suspended for two years with a three month electronically monitored curfew, rehabilitation requirements and a  month driving ban. Richard Herrmann, defending, said: These really are the most extraordinary set of circumstances that led to him behaving in the way he did.

A new study, led by infectious disease expert Professor Oliver Pybus and published on Virological.org, analysed genomes of virus samples from , infected Brits. These were then compared to almost , SARS-CoV- samples from around the globe, with  per cent said to have originated in similar strains from Spain. Another  per cent came from France,  per cent from Belgium, and  per cent Italy, while just . per cent of the UKaposs cases came directly from China where the pandemic started, according to the study. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The virus is constantly mutating meaning scientists must compare current strains found in Britain with similar ones found where and earlier in the pandemic to estimate where they may have started. It comes as the Institute for Economics and Peacesaid on Wednesday the spread of Covid- was highly correlated with air travel - pointing the finger at Britainaposs constant flights in the early stages as having facilitated contagion. The UK Government’s policies on air travel have faced major criticism during the pandemic.  International arrivals have only been forced to enter a -day quarantine since Monday, but the Government previously resisted calls to restrict flights from high-risk countries. At the time, officials insisted there was no evidence that closing borders would be an effective measure. On March , just one day after the first death in the UK as a result of coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wasnapost considering limiting flights.  The Prof Pybus-led study - which is yet to be peer-reviewed - suggests most of the imported cases occurred in mid-March. However, the study rules out the prospect that Britainaposs crisis can all stem back to a apospatient zeroapos - rather multiple carriers must have introduced it to the country before it spiralled out of control.

Gemma Palmer had her lips injected with a full millilitre of lip filler - double her usual dose - after she trusted a local beautician. But she was left with a lopsided, swollen and painful mouth after the the liquid gathered together on the right side of her top lip. The -year-old had the fillers dissolved and she was pain free for eight months until her lip became hot and painful, doubled in size and then burst - a painful five times. Two years on and support worker Gemma said experts have told her they reckon lip filler is still trapped inside her face. The mum-of-one from Litherland, Lancashire, is awaiting specialist treatment to have it removed, and is warning other women of the dangers of fillers. Gemma said: It was horric, I was in so much pain both physically and mentally. My lip made me cry and I was so upset both before and after my lip exploded as the pain and the swelling affected my everyday le.  I was really scared and worried when my lip exploded - I was so anxious that it could leave me disfigured le. I felt so embarrassed and ashamed to leave my house and also embarrassed to tell people what exactly had happened. All together, Iaposve had about six weeks off of work because of the lip filler problems.  Gemma had previously had half a millilitre of lip filler injected in August  with no problems. Missing her plumped pout, she had her lips injected again in October , this time with a full millilitre of lip filler - and disastrous consequences. One week after her injection, Gemmaaposs lip filler clumped together in a painful lump on the right side of her top lip.  Her lip was so swollen and painful that she couldnapost eat anything but soup and after being unable to massage the filler out of her lip, Gemma was forced to eventually have her filler dissolved a week later. The clump in her lip was finally gone and Gemma ed to normal le but eight months later, her lip grew hot and swollen again in July . Gemma said: I was at home cleaning when I felt a burning sensation and throbbing in my lip.  I knew it was about to flare up again but hoped it would be ok by the morning - how wrong I was! I woke up and my lip had swollen up so much that I could hardly speak. It carried on swelling over the next couple of days until it finally popped open which was both disgusting and extremely painful. Gemma visited her local GP surgery but despite telling them about her previous problems with lip fillers, her issue was dismissed as a cold sore.Sent home with anti viral tablets, Gemmaaposs lip slowly cleared up over the next few weeks but sheaposs had the same problem come back every few months. She has now suffered with her lip swelling and exploding five times - most recently in March this year.  Gemma said: The pain gets more extreme every time and this time round has definitely been the worst. My whole mouth filled with blisters from the swelling which kept popping and filling my entire mouth with blood. I couldnapost eat, I was in constant pain. Tired of being dismissed by doctors she visited a private cosmetic surgery expert who finally told her why it was happening. She told me straight away that there was still lip filler trapped inside my top lip two years after I got injected, she said. She will be putting a dissolvant in my lip and then Iaposll be on antibiotics for a week and hopefully this will be the last time it happens.

The decision was taken after both schools were shut on Monday when a teacher tested positive for Covid-. The closures come  days after pupils in Reception, Year  and Year  were cleared toto primary school in England as the lockdown is eased. The government is under pressure to resume childrenaposs education after admitting that some pupils will not be able tountil September at the earliest. Annemarie Williams, the executive headteacher at the schools, which share a site in Main Street, sent an email to parents on Tuesday night telling them of the decision to close.

The monarch picked out her most-loved steeds showing a deep personal connection to each one. Her choices include tributes to the memory of her late father George VI with Aureole which she inherited from the King, and the moment when her daughter Princess Anne won the European Eventing Championships on Doublet - a horse bred by Her Majesty. The head of state also chose the racehorse Estimate which triumphed in the Ascot Gold Cup, making her the first monarch to win the trophy. Others included Burmese, the mare she rode at Trooping the Colour for  years, her trusty fell pony Emma, and Sanction with whom the monarch had an almost telepathic bond. The Queen has long been known for her love of horses. She had her first riding lesson at the age of three, and now, at , was recently pictured on one of her fell ponies at Windsor while in lockdown. She selected eight special horses that she and her family have loved riding and watching, plus five of the most memorable racehorses of all time that she has bred and owned. The Queenaposs stud groom and manager at Windsor Castle, Terry Pendry, and John Warren, the Queenaposs bloodstock and racing adviser, provided insights into her choices, in consultation with the monarch for the feature in Horse  Hound magazine released today.  Mr Pendry paid tribute to the equestrian mastery of the monarch, who has bred racehorses, carriage horses, hunters, sports and riding horses, and polo ponies. Her knowledge and expertise is well known. She names all of her horses and ponies herself and can remember the parentage of every single one, he said. She still rides to this very day, and it is an important part of her le. Her Majesty has a fountain of knowledge in all things equine, you might say a living encyclopaedia.  Mr Warren heralded the Queenaposs patience as he told how she has continued to work on her understanding of equestrian matters over the decades. Her Majesty has developed a deep, profound knowledge, which she has consistently worked on and thought about throughout most of her le, he said. It takes the same sort of precise expertise as a watchmaker to produce a somewhat fragile racehorse to perform on the big occasions and indeed any occasion at all - especially when they are expected to race at speeds of up to mph. These incredibly highly charged creatures, full of blood and muscle, are developed from birth with kid gloves and the sophisticated jigsaw of trying to put all the pieces together is a constant challenge that continues to intrigue the Queen.  To deal with the constant challenges and disappointments, as all horse people will know, the greatest asset you need to have with horses is patience - which luckily the Queen has in spades. Here are the Queenaposs favourite horses: . BetsyA black-brown mare that Her Majesty used to ride in the s. Mr Pendry said: Betsy was full of character and spirit and much loved by the Queen.  . BurmeseBurmese was presented to Her Majesty in  by The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Queen rode the mare in Trooping the Colour for  years. . Doublet Bred as a polo pony, it was the horse Princess Anne won the European Eventing Championships with at Burghley in . Mr Pendry said: The Queen bred both the horse and the rider! . ColumbusThis horse was sired by Colonist, Winston Churchillaposs stallion.  Anne first evented Columbus at novice and intermediate level but found him too strong. He was also a favourite of Captain Mark Phillips and won Badminton in . Mr Pendry said: Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother always said he was the Grand National horse that never was. She would have loved him for herself. . SanctionSanction was a brown riding horse and a firm favourite for many years. Sanction was almost telepathic and had a very strong bond with Her Majesty... Sanction was the last home-bred horse that Her Majesty rode before making the decision to start riding native ponies.  A little closer to the ground, so to speak, Mr Pendry revealed. . Balmoral Jingle The Highland pony was a huge success in the show ring and eventually went on to become a broodmare at the Balmoral Stud. . Balmoral CurlewAnother favourite of the Highland ponies who was also a key show ring performer and became a broodmare. . Emma the Fell ponyA wonderful servant to Her Majesty and is still going strong at the age of  as one of the Queenaposs riding ponies, Mr Pendry said.  The Queenaposs top five favourite racehorses are: . AureoleAureole was bred by George VI and was the first horse the Queen inherited from her late father. Mr Warren said the memorable horse was the Queenaposs first top-class exciting racehorse, and although the animal was feisty and highly strung, the Queen knew how to get the best out of him. . DoutelleThe Chestnut stallion won many races for the Queen.  He retired to the Sandringham Stud but his career was cut short, dying at the age of only eight. . Highclere Another all-time favourite was Highclere, a Dual Classic winner, who was ridden to victory in both the  Guineas and Prix de Diane in Paris, In Paris, an enormous, delighted crowd chanted Vive La Reine after the win.. Phantom GoldWinner of the Ribblesdale at Royal Ascot, St Simon and Geoffrey Freer Stakes.

Buckingham Palace has released details of the Windsor Castle event that will see Her Majesty take two royal salutes from the Welsh Guards on Saturday. The head of state was last seen at a major event on March  when she attended the Westminster Abbey Commonwealth Day service with senior members of the monarchy and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who made their final appearance as working royals. Saturdayaposs ceremony will be carried out by a detachment from the st Battalion Welsh Guards, whose colour - or military flag - was due to be trooped this year at the Queenaposs Birthday Parade on Horse Guards in Whitehall. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.    Stationed at Windsor Castle, the servicemen have played a key role in the military response to the Covid- pandemic over the past few months. When the Queen arrives at the castleaposs quadrangle she will receive a royal salute which will be followed by a set of military drills and a musical performance by a Band of the Household Division. The drills will include the colour being paraded in front of the servicemen and the ceremony will end with a second royal salute followed by the Guardsmen and the military musicians marching from the quadrangle.  The ceremony is expected to last about  minutes and will see the Guardsmen performing their drills two metres apart with the military musicians also observing social distancing.

Stuart Richie, , was fishing from a kayak in Luce Bay, near Ardwell in southwest Scotland, when he picked up a bite. But he barely had a chance to reel it in before a tope shark pounced on the catch and dragged it back to the deep, bending Stuart’s rod and snapping his line. “I had baited the light rod with a strip of mackerel to seethere was anything small around and hooked a dogfish,” he said. “When the dogfish broke the surface I immediately saw something behind it. I tried to pull the dogfish clear, but the shark was too fast and turned with a splash and grabbed it. “My rod bent as the shark tried to get away with the fish, and with a splash and final kick of its tail it snapped my line and was gone.” He continued: “It’s always a shock when you see a shark shape in the water, especially when you’re so close to it. “When it grabbed the fish I was shocked and just held on. I was praying that the GoPro was recording as no one would have believed me.” Tope sharks, also known as school sharks, can grow to be more than six feet long with a weight of over lbs. And they are far from picky about their diet, eating whatever is plentul in their environment. But it’s the first time that Stuart, a navigator with the merchant navy, has seen one feed in such a way.  “I’ve spent years at sea on ships travelling the world,” he said. “I have been kayak fishing for around five years and have kitted my kayak out with an echo sounder fish finder as well as an electric motor. “I have encountered these sharks before and they are one of my favourite species to catch.

Shocking footage showed Derek Chauvin, , kneeling on Mr Floydaposs neck as the victim repeatedly said he couldnapost breathe. He is now charged with second degree murder and manslaughter - although Mr Floydaposs family have called for the charge to be upgraded to first degree murder. According to Fox News, the former Minneapolis officer - who was sacked following Mr Floydaposs death - was weighing up a universal deal with federal and state prosecutors before his arrest. Sources said that state murder charges would have been included in the deal. And it came so close to being agreed that a press conference three days after Mr Floydaposs death was set to announce the deal, Fox reports. Instead US Attorney Erica MacDonald told reporters that day: “I thought we would have another development to talk to you about, but we don’t. Chauvin was arrested the following day and charged with third-degree murder, which was subsequently changed to second-degree. It is not known why the deal wasnapost reached. Hennepin County Attorney’s Office spokesperson Chuck Laszewski told Fox: “There were early negotiations with the defendant . “Ultimately, those negotiations failed. Both Chauvinaposs current attorney, Eric Nelson, and former attorney Tom Kelly have yet to comment. It has been claimed that aggressive Chauvin had bumped heads with Mr Floyd when they worked together as bouncers at a nightclub last year. Former colleague David Pinney says they knew each other well, and said Chauvinaposs behaviour toward Mr Floyd was hostile even back then. Both men worked as security guards at El Nuevo Rodeo in Minneapolis. He said: It has a lot to do with Derek being extremely aggressive within the club with some of the patrons, which was an issue.  Club owner Maya Santamaria previously told CBS that the police officer was afraid and intimidated by black people. She said: He sometimes had a real short fuse and he seemed afraid.  "},{"url":null,"title":"photo supermarket shelves sparks heated","story":"NewsPhoto of supermarket shelves sparks heated debate over everyday racismAn image showing two contrasting supermarket shelves has attracted thousands of comments and sparked a debate as some labelled it disgusting while others argued its not a race thingShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video photo-supermarket-shelves-sparks-heated-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news us-news photo-supermarket-shelves-sparks-heated-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

It will be a massive plus that we have something to work to.“Every manager will probably tell you the same – we need a date for when we are going to go back.“But as I said, I am cautious because there is an awful lot going on at the moment, from where you can take your kids to when you can go and meet other people.“Everything is changing and I don’t think football will be any dferent.”Reconstruction plans have now been run up the flagpole and ripped back down again more than once.Consensus, as is so often the case in Scottish football, has proved impossible to reach.Meanwhile clubs like Dundee, whose business model means they sit uncomfortably in the Championship, have been left in limbo.It has affected everyone at the club – and their manager is growing tired of the uncertainty.However, McPake is conscious of the wider issues in today’s world, and his annoyance is tempered by realism.He said: “There is frustration but for me that can’t be put on anyone.“There is a frustration in every industry about where we find ourselves.“We have never been in a situation like this before and what that brings is a real level of uncertainty.“We are looking for answers every day. I would be very reluctant to blame that on a single person or organisation as you can see it right across the world at the minute. But yes, it is frustrating.“If you are looking at it purely from a footballing point of view it is really dficult for the players, for the backroom staff and for the fans.“But again there is a bigger picture here in terms of a health crisis.“We have to be guided by the government and the governing bodies in football but it has not been easy.“Everybody is in the same boat really and there are no real answers to what is happening and when we can get back to what is perceived as normal.“It is dficult – there is no other way of putting it.”For as long as the Championship remains without a definitive restart date, many elements of Dundee’s normal business operations will remain on hold. On the football side, that means recruitment and day-to-day work with players.They are crucial to any club’s success.But McPake insists he – and everybody  at Dens Park who is not furloughed – is doing everything he can to ensure as seamless ato action as possible.“I speak to Johna couple of times a week or maybe more but nothing has really changed,” he said. “We are where we are and there is no definitive date to when we can start back. It is not like a normal summer or break in the season like a winter one or international break.“There is always a structure to football and when you are back. The players, staff, everybody knows that but at the moment that has completely gone.“It is everyone’s longest lay-off – we are now getting to the stage where the players have been off the same amount of timethey had a serious injury so that brings its problems physically and mentally.“It is just about trying to get everything right so that when we do get the green light to start back we are in as good a position as possible.”EXCLUSIVE: Ex-Dundee striker Peter MacDonald confirms he’s hanging up his boots and says best day of his career came as a Dark Blues player\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fc-peter-macdonald-retirement-st-johnstone-rangers embed # secretWJcMNsFIpT\" data-secret\"WJcMNsFIpT\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There are a number of players we are looking at because we know what we need.“We are looking to strengthen the wider areas because we don’t have a lot in there at the minute.“We have a few young ones but senior-wise we only have Paul McMullan and Peter Pawlett.“We would like to add another couple because we feel moving up a level we need that pace in the wide areas to break teams and also to counter-attack at the many tough venues we will encounter next season.“They are all key areas we have been doing a lot of work on, looking at players and we are just waiting to make our move really.”Robbie Neilson admits Dundee United are already looking to snap up their next superstar-in-waiting\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-robbie-neilson-transfers embed # secretAGbVqRTtF\" data-secret\"AGbVqRTtF\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

By adding night-scented plants and soft lighting, along with pale-coloured flowers and foliage that appear to glow in the fading light, your garden will become an enticing ‘room’ to sit in at the end of the day.White flowering plants # like big blooms of hydrangeas # have a lovely glow in the evening garden reflecting the last of the light which makes them appear brighter than other plants.  Pale blues and lilacs also look their best in fading light, so sea holly with its tiny blue flowers that sit in rosettes of silvery-grey bracts is a great addition.Bright foliage also creates an evening glow in the garden. Light-coloured, iegated and silver leaf plants reflect any available light. Lambs Earis a popular ground cover plant that has the most wonderful soft, furry, silver-grey leaves.  It’s fairly drought resistant so a good choice for a dry, sunny border.Many beautul flowers only produce scent at night and often have a stronger aroma than their daytime counterparts.  Fragrance is released from night-scented flowers as the heat of the day lingers into the evening.  Petunias may seem be a strange choice for a night garden, but they are night scented. Some smell during the day, but not to the same intensity of the night scent. Night Scented Stocks do just that and have a pastel colour flower palate.It’s best to plant scented night garden flowers where you’ll brush against them or come close to them. Try planting them around doors and paths.  If you are planting in pots make sure you arrange them round seating areas to provide a heady aroma or position them near doors and windows so that the fragrance drts inside.Even though planting the right night-flowering plants in the right place will give you stunning effects,you want to really enjoy your garden after dark, some form of garden lighting is essential.  Try not to floodlight your entire garden. Instead, pick out specic plants and trees to showcase. Up lighting, either set on spikes or recessed into the ground, showcases plants beautully at night.But it’s not just at night time you want your garden to look good so here are some tips for this month from the Royal Horticultural Society."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 15 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A big thank you to whoever has tidied up Ardrishaig Community Garden, mown the grass and repaired and painted the fences.Such a peaceful place to call into while out exercising.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge.

Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week. They deserve the attention, but communities across Argyll equally merit praise for their kindness and community spirit.Again, it comes as little surprise.That#s the way we do it in Argyll."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert spruced up and ready for tee off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMembers will come back # in good time # to a spruced up and tidy Glenralloch.Maintenance and improvement work has carried on at Tarbert Golf Club in line with current guidelines.The committee reports the course is in immaculate condition with  greenkeeper Graham Prentice on top of things.The greens were hollow-cored earlier in the year and are gradually filling in and some welcome heat and rainwill enhance the greens.Other #rainy day# jobs have been carried out by volunteer members, which has helped the overall appearance of the course.Club secretary John MacNab successfully applied for the small business grant.

Mindfulness concentrates your mind on the ‘here and now’ and is a proven way of dealing with mild depression or anxiety.Focus on what the plants feel like – not just their fragrance when touched – from leathery and lacey to soft and smooth. You can also mix plants that are great to touch with tactile hard landscaping elements such as a water feature, smooth polished round pebbles or the glazed ceramics.Some top touching plants and features to considerLeaves # try Stachys byzantina, commonly known as Lamb#s Ear. Its soft, downy, furry silver-grey leaves are a favourite among gardeners who tend to use it for ground cover in rich soil. As a contrast there is Acuba japonicawhich has smooth, glossy leathery leaves.Flowers # who can resist touching a bottlebrush Callistemon cintrinus – bundles of tiny delicate stamen flowers form a brush that’s soft to touch – or the soft paper-thin petals of a poppy Papaver orientale.Grasses # run your hand over the arching, thread-like leaves of feathery Stipa tenuissima also known as Mexican feather grass or the more robust drought proof ornamental Festuca glauca with thread-like blue foliage that forms dense mounds.Bark – tree bark can also provide a tactile experience especially when it’s the stunning flowering cherry Prunus serrulate with mahogany coloured bark that peels away in bands round the trunk.Landscaping – you can easily y the textures in your garden by choosing dferent hard landscaping options. If you have smooth pebbles surrounding a water feature that you can run your hand over and through, you could place lichen-covered rocks in another area of the garden.Our general well-being is intrinsically linked to the natural world which is why Thrive – the gardening for health charity – has developed the Thrive Gardening Club.For fortnightly tips on getting the most out of your garden, whatever your age or ability, and information on how gardening can keep you healthy and feeling good visit www.thrive.org.uk get-involved keep-in-touch subscribe-to-gardening-clubThrive is the UK’s leading provider of social and therapeutic horticulture programmes using gardening to bring about positive changes in the lives of people living with disabilities, ill health or mental health issues, or who are isolated, disadvantaged or vulnerable."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor may 22 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Mental Health Awareness Week, now in its th year, runs from May  to May .This year, the theme for the week is kindness and across the country, people will be celebrating kindness in digital and creative ways within social distancing restrictions.The last couple of months, with all the uncertainty of the virus and the impact of lockdown, have been an extremely stressful and worrying time for many people across the Highlands and Islands. People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again.

Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

council warned that the launch of a new vision for the area three years after the local authority produced its Cockenzie Masterplan document ndash which it has never adopted ndash would leave the public with no confidence in the planning system.East Lothian Council paid consultants to produce the Cockenzie Masterplan for the former Cockenzie Power Station site, which it owns, after a series of

have been consulted on the power station site and the result was a masterplan commissioned by the council but not adopted by them.\"We have submitted this masterplan to be included in NPF.\"A number of consultations have taken place in our area and they have come to nothing.\"The feeling is the residents have lost confidence in the system.Neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council also raised concerns about the consultation.Brian Weddell, chairman, questioned whether the proposed train station in the new plan would ever happen, saying: ldquoThere has been no meaningful consultation with local communities who all have concerns about the impact of this development on their communities.The new consultation is based around a study, drawn up in partnership with East Lothian Council, the

Hotels require one space per room.I understand that the parking standards have only recently come into effect and all other licensed premises have the benefit of being historical licensed premises and therefore protected. However, I fully believe that a common sense approach should have been taken in this instance, particularly as I submitted a very detailed travel plan which included not only promoting nearby parking options, bus timetables and taxis but actually incentivised travel to and from The Catrsquos Pyjamas by bus, taxi or on foot. When coming up with the concept of The Catrsquos Pyjamas in late summer early autumn  the first thing I did, being a total novice to owning a bar, was to engage with the licensing department.The licensing standards officer advised me I could operate with occasional licences whilst working toward the full premises licence so after submitting the occasional licence applications I was surprised to be told by planning I needed to submit a change of use application for the occasional licences.Bewildered by the conflicting information but just wishing to do what was required, I immediately submitted the application and paid the associated fee.It is frustrating that I was erroneously informed that a change of use was required for occasional licences which stopped me operating and establishing precedent.It is also frustrating I find myself in this situation because I accepted the advice and guidance of East Lothian Council. I am not seeking to apportion all the blame on the council as I have made mistakes, the biggest of which is being naive enough to believe that those who should have and give you the correct information actually do have and give you the correct information. What we have created at The Catrsquos Pyjamas is truly special. Those who have enjoyed an evening with us will validate that.I have had such incredible support from people across Dunbar and beyond that it continues to blow my mind. There is a real desire for The Catrsquos Pyjamas to work and given the chance it could become something truly amazing which is beneficial not only to the town but the county. But this journey has been very painful and costly.There has been a clear campaign against The Catrsquos Pyjamas to the point of it being a vendetta.Objectors have ly contacted the police to report noise when there was none ndash veried by Police Scotland ndash just to get it on the record ahead of the licensing board hearing. I need to take time to reflect on everything that has happened, to reflect on the impact that it has had on myself and my family. I need to investigate whether another location would be better orthe business model should change.At the moment all I can say is sincere thank you to everyone who has supported this venture from the outset and especially to my family for all the blood, sweat, tears and cash they have put into creating this very special place.Ross Hardie,The Catrsquos Pyjamas,Belhaven,Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"kids-create-chain-key-workers-tesco-superstore","story":"They were asked to create a window display for the store by its community champion, Jane Shepherd, and were rewarded with some treats.The hub, based at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, provides learning and childcare.

They are a giant of nature, yet also incredibly intelligent. They feel emotion like we do, in fact possibly more so as the emotional part of their brain is even more developed than that of humans.The old saying that ldquoan elephant never forgets is rooted in this fact. An elephantrsquos emotional intelligence comes from its ability to remember and recall distant memory. Like humans, an elephantrsquos way of being is mostly learned in early le, rather than just based on instinct.They are therefore highly sensitive creatures, influenced and affected by what they experience just as we are.Irsquove heard dferent versions of this tale, and here I have peppered it very slightly with my own style:Once, a king in ancient India owned an elephant. This royal elephant was the joy not just of the king, but also his people.The trainer would ride the elephant every day along the streets. She was a magnicent sight, and children would run out to wave and watch the elephant go by. The trainer took a dferent route each day so people in dferent neighbourhoods all had a chance to enjoy the spectacle.The people felt a real love and affinity for the elephant. Despite her size and strength, she was gentle and affectionate with the people. She would pat children carefully on their heads with her trunk and took care in where she walked.The elephant made people feel safe. More than once she had saved a child from drowning in the nearby river, or from a predator from the jungle. She was a sacred animal to the people.But then people began to notice a change in the elephantrsquos behaviour. She became aggressive and unpredictable. Instead of being patient with the children she knocked them out of her way with her trunk. Instead of being careful where she walked, she deliberately trampled on peoplersquos gardens.The trainer tried his best to control the elephant, but she seemed like a dferent animal. He couldnrsquot understand why she was behaving so dferently.It just got worse, until one day the elephant suddenly set off on a charge and rampaged through the streets, trumpeting loudly as she charged at the terried people, almost killing some of them.The king was horried and ordered the elephant to be confined to her stables. With dficulty she was finally brought under control and locked in.ldquoWhat is going on  asked the king to the trainer.ldquoI have no idea your majesty he replied, ldquoitrsquos asshe is a dferent elephant.ldquoPerhaps the elephant is ill in some way  suggested one of the kingrsquos advisors. But the vet found nothing physically wrong.Then the trainer suggested asking an old man who lived in the jungle as ldquohe is known for his wisdom in understanding animals, perhaps he will know what the cause of this is.So the king sent a messenger and the old man came to the royal palace.ldquoCan you help  asked the king.The old man asked to be left alone with the elephant for a while.When he ed he looked at the king and said: ldquoWhatever is wrong is something that cannot be seen. I must spend some time with the elephant to understand what is troubling her.And so the old man decided to watch over the elephant that night. He smeared himself in mud to mask his scent and hid in a corner of the stable.It was late evening when he heard voices.A group of men had entered the stables from a small side door. They were a gang of murderers. They were using the royal elephant stable as a place to meet and plan their activities. And in so doing they recounted stories of their deeds.Their leader was a man with a cold and ruthless heart. He told stories about his le and deeds, of how hersquod murdered and tortured people he didnrsquot like. Members of his gang laughed and shared their tales too, likewise full of hatred and cruelty.The elephant slumbered as these tales were told, but they were unknowingly heard by her. When the elephant woke the following morning, the tales of hate and violence still swirled in her mind.The old man went to the king.ldquoYour majesty, there are two things you must do to cure the elephant.ldquoThe first is to remove the murderers who meet in the stables at night. The second is you must find the kindest people, who live their lives with love and understanding. Then ask them to meet at night in the stable as the elephant sleeps and tell each other stories from their lives tales of love and understanding. If you do this, then the elephant will be cured.The king looked bemused.ldquoI will most certainly remove the murderers, he said, ldquobut are you saying that stories will cure the elephant ldquoYes, your majesty, replied the old man, ldquobut the right stories. You see we are made from the stories we hear.He went on: ldquoIf we constantly hear tales of hatred and violence then those stories paint our vision of le with fear, loathing and cruelty.ldquoButwe mostly hear tales of love and understanding, then our mind is coloured with kindness for others, and for ourselves.ldquoWe are affected by the stories we hear, evenwe donrsquot realise we have been listening to them.ldquoYour elephant was unknowingly listening to tales of hatred and killing every night as she slept. So her mind was filled with hate and distrust her vision of the world changed and so did her behaviour.ldquoIf she hears good stories then she will eventually become her kind self again.The king nodded in understanding and agreed to act on this. Within a few weeks the elephantrsquos behaviour had changed for the better.ldquoYou are indeed wise in the ways of elephants, the king said to the old man.ldquoThe truth in this is not just for elephants, the old man replied.ldquoPeople are like your elephant the stories they hear will paint their world and affect how they live in it.The king nodded once again.ldquoMy job is done, said the old man, ldquoI will nowto the forest.ldquoBy the way, your elephant will have a calf, and her calf must hear good stories too.ldquoHow can I pay you for your wisdom  asked the king.The old man thought for a moment, then said: ldquoBe a king who tells good stories tales of kindness and understanding. And be a good listener to the stories told by your people.ldquoThen you will be a truly great leader and your kingdom will flourish and be a happier place.ldquoIf you do that, it will be my greatest reward."},{"url":null,"title":"black-lives-matter-donate-help-get-diverse-books-primary-schools","story":"The fund -which has raised over pound, since it was created on Wednesday, June  - aims to help black, Asian and minority ethnicstudents to feel represented by their school libraries.The initiative was inspired by protests that have taken place across the world calling for justice after the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May .Who created the fund Scott Emmons, who created the fund, told the PA news agency:ldquoTherersquos a lack of books in primary schools where not only can teachers teach the white students about these issues, but also the BAME students are severely under-represented in the books that they have.\"Mr Emmons, , who lives in Wanstead, added: ldquoI went to the protest on Wednesday in Hyde Park and came away feeling so energised.

The fact is that itrsquos a good story and itrsquos important, and itrsquos why street names are important.There are streets in Inveresk named after the Wedderburn family, such as Wedderburn Court and Wedderburn Terrace.When askedthese street names should be changed, Sir Geoff said: ldquoYou let people know information about the name and that these streets were, for example, named after this family who were slave owners and lived nearby.He added that plaques could be placed next to such street signs, alerting and educating people on the history behind the name, something that could be beneficial to future generations.Sir Geoff noted the important role stories like these played in East Lothian history. He said: ldquoItrsquos an important part of East Lothian and Inveresk history andyou remove that or rename it and call it something , you could be removing part of the history of East Lothian.ldquoSome of the street names, I donrsquot want them removed.ldquoBy removing them you are removing the deed, andyou remove the deed people are not going to be aware in the future and then history could be dferent.

For example, a personrsquos background, ethnicity, disability, skin colour, culture and religion should not determine or undermine these basic human rights. We work to eliminate all forms of discrimination and inequalities and promote human rights.When askedthere was a racism problem in East Lothian, Mr Choudhury said: ldquoYes we know there is a problem with racism because we deal with cases all the time so we know itrsquos still re in our communities.An example he gave involved a black man who was racially discriminated at work through how he was treated and dealt with by white members of staff.Staff are said to have made comments about his accent, racial jokes about his culture and where hersquos from.Mr Choudhury added: ldquoWe also have many cases of BAME residents who are racially abused by their neighbours and some have faced graffiti on their doors and car as well as verbal abuse on a daily basis.

Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, saying he was \"surprised and excited by it\". It will now be included in a new edition of the authors The Old Man and the Sea to be published later this year.War wounded Born in  in Illinois in the US, Hemingway became a news reporter and then left for the Italian Front where he enlisted as an ambulance driver during World War One, ing home having been seriously wounded by mortar fire.

These restrictions are severe and place Scotlandrsquos island communities and tourism enterprises out of kilter with the rest of the country.:Scottish tourism at risk of total collapseldquoIt will not be financially viable to open most tourism businesses with no tourism customer base and we have ready examples to share of businesses that will be forced to make island staff redundant and that will collapse or go into administration and not survive this pandemic.ldquoMany of these businesses are not just for tourists ndash they play a key part in the le and health of locals year-round, are community hubs and support other businesses through local supply chains. The tourism income makes them viable, and without it they will struggle to survive as business entities - with all the serious socio-economic implications this will bring for the inidual island economies.\"He added: ldquoMany of these businesses have fallen through the cracks in support being made available to date. They are fearful that they will get further into debt and collapse. We cannot overstress the anxiety being experienced as a consequence of these new circumstances.ldquoThe islands are being penalised and we believe unnecessarily.

This would be counter-productive by making it easier for those in denial to ignore the fact that Scots were involved, in many cases far more successfully than their counterparts in England, in this despicable, inhuman trade. Far better to leave the statues and the street names, with the addition of a plaque to record their involvement, as a permanent reminder of a very dark period in this countrys history.TJ Dowds, Cumbernauld.I AGREE to a large extent with George Kaythat education has a key role in anti-racism. The anti-racist protesters we have seen in our cities over the last few days are misguided in my eyes as they only see black and white in the issue instead of the big picture, including the brother of racism ndash sectarianism. If the recent anti-racist actions of defacing history continue, then in  yearsrsquo time, slavery- deniers will emerge and say that black people made it all up.I feel that the demonstrators did not stop to understand that racism is only one facet of the issue of discrimination in the human psyche which is embedded in people early on in le so that they visualize the world and its people in binary form ndash us and them. It is perhaps a primal form of defence we are unable to shake off even after local tribalism and clan culture disappeared. Not only people are black and white but we talk daily about issues being ldquoblack and white, meaning there must be absoluteness in truths in our lives.We regularly hope that a rounded schooling will enlighten young people yet we condone our polarising education system which is too often about black and white right answer and wrong answer success and failure winners and losers top of the class and bottom of the class a hit or a miss. We can hardly expect young people to learn to be unassuming and non-judgmentalwe subject them to regular assessments to rate them competitively as good or bad learners.We will not stop racism without first stopping the practice of classying people.Bill Brown, Milngavie.I SHARE the views expressed by Gordon Casely . Many have reacted in support of the protests which have taken place in support of Black Lives Matter throughout the world. The fact that a minority resorted to violence only served to distract from the force of the protests.I wrote some months ago to make the point thatwe seek to revisit history in such a fashion and to apply todays moral standards, then why stop at slavery  Yes, it is true that figures such as Stirling and Cochrane in Glasgow made fortunes using slave labour. However, many other prominent figures in Glasgow made their fortunes during the Industrial Revolution on the backs of their workers, who toiled in dire conditions without proper wages and who lived in squalid and over-crowded housing. Let the whole story of exploitation be remembered.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.DISTASTEFUL as slavery in British plantations was, history cannot be changed. Just as it should not be forgotten, there is no case for the febrile revisionism currently being preached. If we truly learn from history we should perhaps be more circumspect about trading with countries where slavery is still a fact of le. Such as China.But we will continue to appease China and turn a blind eye because we demand cheap consumer goods just as we once craved sugar and tobacco. Instead of mob vandalism might it not be more constructive to challenge the sourcing of some of todayrsquos biggest consumer companies in the world John Dunlop, Ayr.IN the understandable fury arising from the unjustiable killing of George Floyd, who was admittedly no saint, by a law enforcement officer, we have clearly witnessed global demonstrations against the prejudice ingrained in the American psyche which has claimed yet another victim. However, when emotion is unleashed in the actions of looting, violence and the destruction of statues, the rule of law and the primacy of reason are replaced by an ungovernable populist vigilantism.If society is to regain its stability, all must accept that emotion must not overpower the central pivot reason plays in the governance of the state.Righteous indignation should not be reflected through major civil disturbances but should harness the process of law to right the wrongs prevalent in the distortion of perspective created by misguided historical precedent, motivated by self-interest.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.Read more: Letters: We canrsquot rewrite history, but we can make the present better"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-snp-needs-called-account-profligate-spending","story":"How much is that per person  Where exactly does it go  These funds come from taxpayers, either iniduals or corporations throughout the entire UK, but the SNP has successfully broken the link between services and taxation in Scotland now. There are many people who believe that most of their services, support, and medication are delivered at no cost, magically appearing from the ether like manna from heaven.They are not costings are just pushed along vertically or horizontally. There are economic, social and environmental limits to everything, except in Scotland apparently.Surely such profligate spending in Scotland by the SNP needs more attention at the moment, not just to refute the SNPrsquos vision of a \"milk and honey\" independent Scotland but for taxpayers across the UK.David Bone, Girvan.MAY I answer the question put by Liz Galbraithregarding how an independent Scotland would pay for the current crisis An independent Scotland with its own National Bank would do exactly as all other independent countries have done and are doing ndash borrow from their own National Bank, a debt incurred which would never need repaid, as they own that bank. It is simply a strategy for printing money and increasing the supply within the economy, and that is exactly what Westminster is doing.As things stand, as part of the UK, Scotland is not allowed to borrow a single penny from anyone, nor is it allowed to overspend its budget. In fact, it is legally obliged not to spend all its budget, but must end every financial year with a surplus. It is therefore prevented by our membership of the UK from dealing with this crisis as all independent countries around the world are able to. The value of oil, or anything , is totally irrelevant.P Davidson, Falkirk.I NOTE the letter from Liz Galbraith in respect of dferences between New Zealand and Scotland and \"extreme financial challenges\". I quickly checked a few things and found that GDP per capita in both countries are broadly similar, that Scotland has slightly more people, New Zealand has more land. So how will New Zealand handle those challenges given that they are not any wealthier than Scotland I submit the dference in performance is a combination of constitutional dferences and powers with, perhaps, the luck to have an exceptional leader at the time of crisis. Of course, Scotland may also have had an exceptional leader in Nicola Sturgeon, but without the kind of constitutional powers that Jacinda Ardern has, we may never know.Iain Cope, Glasgow G.RUTH Marrand others are indulging in a fallacy in their assertions that \" Scotland was independent...\" with regard to the current Covid- pandemic. There is no comparison to be made between Scotland and New Zealand, not least because the latter is an archipelago so biologically remote from the rest of the world and anomalous that it had no terrestrial mammals at all until the Polynesians arrived in the th century.What is more, Scotland voted to stay in the UK in . The choice of two million Scots was the preference for the risks and responsibilities of being part of bigger and more erse country and economy over those of being part of a smaller and narrower one. If we want to play Ms Marrs parlour game and pretend that something  happened, we can also imagine the penury that Scotland would have faced following the greatest economic shock in its history, and wonder how on earth we would have managed with public services stripped of over pound billion every year.Such speculation is all very entertaining, and makes useful material for the attempts of nationalists to distract us from the failings of the SNP Scottish Government. But Scotland is not New Zealand. Nor Norway nor Denmark nor the Republic of Ireland. Nor in terms of responsibility for public health and the NHS and care homes, is it even England.In the real world, we can only judge Nicola Sturgeon and Jeane Freeman and co by the actions and decisions they have taken, and have failed to take, and above all by the Covid- infection rate and death toll in Scotland. No wonder that their supporters want us to be distracted by their pointless fantasies.Peter A Russell, Glasgow G.Read more: Kate Forbes: Expect deep cuts to public services without new powers from Westminster"},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  My post-lockdown dream is a scone in a local cafe  What  39 s yours ","story":"Our nearby garden centre, a well-run operation, insists on hand sanitation before you enter, and sends customers up, down and across the aisles by luminous arrows, asplaying snakes and ladders.

Unless you are in the shielded category, this will allow two households to meet indoors, or socially distanced drinkers and diners to sup in beer gardens and at pavement tables.

In theory at least. The worry is that,the grim weekly supermarket trip offers any guide, the new normal might feel almost as disturbing as our current lockdown.

And yet, unless there is a surge back to our old ways, the economy will slide even further into the abyss. Itrsquos hard not to feel a moral obligation to help businesses get back on their feet.Some weeks ago, I contemplated what I was most looking forward to doing when we emerged from purdah. Apart from meeting family and friends, top of the list was going for a coffee, closely followed by a day in the library. If to this could be added an early evening drink in the pub, possibly planning our next trip to Italy, I would ask nothing more. What a thrilling lestyle, you must be thinking. Yet Irsquom probably not alone, during these eerily frozen weeks, in realising how narrow and predictable the margins of my le are, and happily so.They say it takes six weeks to form a habit, so perhaps we will get used to the protocols protecting us when we enter the classroom, or train, or go shopping for clothes. It might become second nature to dine behind plastic screens on the bistro table, or to stay three steps away from our nearest and dearest, even in their own homes. And in one respect at least Irsquom looking forward to making my own mask. In winter I resemble a figure in a John Bellany painting, my nose ice cold and red raw. A fleecy face-covering could save on central heating.Even as the danger of infection diminishes, the sobering reality is that fear will persist for a considerable time. To expect to gather in a cafe as we used to, drawing up chairs to crowd around a table, is to day-dream. Almost nothing will be the same as in the good old days, or at least not at first. In the months ahead we will either have to accustom ourselves to new and uncomfortable regulations and rules, or stay housebound.Therersquos little doubt, though, that seeing the ties that bind us being slowly slackened is a huge psychological boost. As yoursquoll have guessed, Irsquom not Melrosersquos answer to Marco Polo. When Ryanairrsquos engines begin to roar, it wonrsquot be me yoursquoll see in the duty free. Yet the mere fact of being banned from travelling more than five miles from home is what has felt so constricting in recent times, even , like me, yoursquore usually quite happy staying within easy walking distance of your door.As we go through the gradual phases of our staggered release, like a barge inching through a lock, simply knowing that we can go wherever we like will come as a tremendous relief. Who careswe must be home by bedtime  Just glimpsing somewhere dferent will be excitement enough. It marks the restoration of a basic human liberty. And, as our leash ens, so spirits will lt. The invisible cordon sanitaire that has been restraining us in will vanish, and to a large degree our lives will feel like our own again.Yet while we yearn to get back to our old haunts, elements of the crisis have shown a better way, which hopefully will endure. The rise in walking and cycling signals a serious cultural sht. Along with the upturn in home deliveries, it might indicate the beginning of the end for the car. Even where I live, in the country, the air is cleaner, the roads emptier, the birds louder. The outpouring of care and concern shown across the nation for neighbours and those in need has strengthened peoplersquos connection to their community. More of us have been shopping or ordering locally, and discovering whatrsquos on our doorstep. Some have been baking their own bread, or cooking from scratch, and discovering the humdrum but satisfying joys of home le. Looking to the uncertain future, a few are on their way to becoming self-sufficient.As we gradually emerge into a freer existence, carrying hand sanitisers the way Clint Eastwood holstered a Colt , one thing seems certain. We wonrsquot take anything for granted again. The simplest of activities have already assumed a profound signicance. To call something ordinary or normal will soon be the highest terms of praise.

Nor was he responsible for a virus that has cruelly laid bare the failings of the country, not least in healthcare, and the inequalities that persist.: Letters - leave the statuesBut as the President that famous buck has to stop with him. It would be a test of even the greatest American leader at any time. One can only wonder what a Johnson, or an FDR, would do. That it falls to Mr Trump to act, and in an election year, lays the ground for troubled times to come.It has been a politically disastrous couple of weeks for the President. The events and images have been shocking. A man dying in the street at the hands of police. Peaceful protestors being tear-gassed and beaten so their commander-in-chief could walk from the White House and hold a bible aloft. A security fence erected in front of the White House, something that was not necessary during the worst civil unrest of the s. Threatening to use soldiers against lawful protesters, and being castigated by a former Defence Secretary for doing so. Tales of a president fleeing to a White House bunker. All of it dreadful, much of it used against America by its opponents.Even Mr Trump, a man who never met a setback he did not try to spin, has had trouble ignoring the plummeting poll ratings that have resulted. In a CNN poll published on Monday, % disapproved of his performance as president, with % approving. Those are the kind of numbers Jimmy Carter and fellow one term President George HW Bush racked up.Overall, the incumbent is  points behind his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden. In what should be further cause for alarm, Mr Trumprsquos support among white voters without degrees is falling, and his problem with women has grown worse. In  he was  points behind with women voters. A recent poll put him  points behind.As ever with the defensive Mr Trump, his instinct is to go on the attack. That could signal more sackings, more likely it will mean getting back on the rally circuit, the place he feels comfortable and wanted.His supporters argue the Black Lives Matter protests, which brought hundreds of thousands on to the streets, are a green light for the Trump rallies to restart. The president has suggested the first event could even be as soon as next week. This at a time when , Americans have died from Covid-, and when the White House infectious diseases adviser, Dr Anthony Fauci, has warned the pandemic ldquoisnrsquot over yet.: The truth about Scotlands slaving pastJust when the US might benefit from devoting its considerable energies into tackling its policing and race relations crises, or even simply pausing for a period of reflection after a dreadful start to the year, the President will in effect be firing the starting gun in the race to the White House.Judging by their advertising, both sides will be using the recent protests to boost their arguments. Mr Trump knows it worked for Richard Nixon in , but he was not the incumbent. It is a tactic fraught with danger in as much as it risks fuelling further tension and ision, the last thing the country needs.We know from past experience the kind of candidate Mr Trump becomes when he fronts one of his rallies. Crowds chanting for Hillary Clinton to be locked up, the mocking of a disabled reporter, the harassment of the press his rallies in the run up to the  election set a sour tone for his presidency from the off. Who will be the scapegoats this time Mr Trump could do with some wise counsel at this point, but that looks in desperately short supply, not least from his own party. Too many Republican candidates are afraid to criticise Mr Trump lest his base turns against them. But as of now he has shown himself unwilling to listen to anyone .Whatever campaign slogan he settles on, Mr Trump will doubtless position himself as the man to save America. Who will save America from Mr Trump is the question his Republican colleagues should be asking themselves.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

If Scottish Labour wanted the endorsement of a home-grown celebrity they could not have done better than the former shipyard worker.But the way they went about it put Connolly off political parties for le.ldquoI used to be a Labour man, says Sir Billy in an interview for the six-part series which ends next week.The film cuts to a Labour PPB in which a young, long-haired Connolly is sitting at a window in a Glasgow flat. He is talking to someone who is off camera, ashe is being interviewed. ldquoAs far as Irsquom concerned every other party represents selfishness, he says. ldquoBasically, itrsquos fairness Irsquom looking for. The picture fades and the slogan ldquoScotland will win with Labour appears.ldquoI was kind of conned into it, says Connolly now. ldquoI was asked to come up to a meeting I might find interesting. I went, I didnrsquot find it interesting, but somebody asked me a question, I answered and I suddenly discovered I was on the [party political broadcast].

She started to try to lsquoout slumrsquo me, saying my slum was worse than your slum. That thing Labour politicians do. I find it pathetic.Connolly has long lampooned notions of Scottishness, nationalism, and patriotism in general. In the  referendum he refused to back Yes, saying he was ldquodeeply suspicious of patriotism. The Brexit vote seemed to change the pro-European Connollyrsquos mind. Last year, when askedhe would like to see Scotland independent, he replied: ldquoI donrsquot know. If Scotland would like it, I would like it.Billy and Us finds the now retired stand-up still performing a dance of the seven veils on independence, but he seems to inch further towards it than ever before.Insisting that his politics change ldquodaily, he says: ldquoIrsquove never liked nationalism in any of its guises. Irsquom not saying Irsquove never agreed with independence. I think a Scottish republic is as good an idea as any I ever heard. But I donrsquot represent anybody, or anything.

He went from his home in working class Partick to the West End, where a woman asked him to go to the cellar and bring back some ldquoanthracite.ldquoThere was only coal there, he says, laughing. ldquoI thought God, they even have dferent names for coal up here. Theyrsquore dferent from us.Connolly, born in a room and kitchen, went on to become the owner of a stately home in Scotland, the -bedroomed Candacraig House in Strathdon. His celebrity friends, and his playing the laird at the Lonach Highland Games, where he entertained guests including Prince Charles, Steve Martin and the late Robin Williams, led to criticism that he was forgetting his working class roots.Though the programme never asks him about the celebrity circuit directly, he says: ldquoIrsquod be invited to dinners, Irsquod turn up and have a good laugh. But I never wanted to be part of it. Itrsquos just not my cup of tea.The concept of class continues to fascinate and repel him. Some find comfort from thinking people are beneath them, he says.ldquoYou see it acted out even in the working class when they look at some poor immigrant and think hersquos below them and they feel quite jolly about that.

This is especially true of the capacities on our ferries as it will signicantly impact island economies where tourism is the leblood for so many.ldquoWhilst the package of grant support which has already made available to many small tourism businesses by the UK and Scottish Governments has been hugely welcomed, there remains a good number still in need of immediate grant support to enable them to be in the best possible position to open on  July.ldquoA longer-term support package for the sector will definitely be needed to ensure the survival of many businesses over the coming nine months.

Looking at excess death rates, more than , people have died at this time this year compared to the same time last year.When asked what had gone wrong, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI think two things ndash one is a paper actually out in Nature, which highlights that around about that time, just before lockdown happened, the first two weeks of March, we probably had , to , infections imported from Italy and Spain, which we just hadnrsquot seen in the surveillance data, until that point.ldquoSo there is much heavier seeding than wersquod expected.He added: ldquoThe key things to determine number of deaths is at what point in your local epidemic you trigger interventions ndash how far in are you when you shut down transmission.ldquoAnd we frankly had underestimated how far into the epidemic this country was, thatrsquos half the reason.ldquoThe second part, which I think would have been more avoidable, is about half of those deaths occurred in care homes.Prof Ferguson continued: ldquoAnd we did all this working under the assumption which was Government policy at the time that care homes would be shielded from infection.He further told the committee: ldquoWe also made a rather optimistic assumption that somehow ndash which was policy ndash that the elderly would be shielded, the most vulnerable would be shielded as the top priority. And that simply failed to happen.Prof Ferguson, whose research helped usher in the lockdown, resigned from his role as a key Government adviser after admitting that he had undermined social distancing rules by reportedly meeting a woman at his home.However, he told the committee he still sits on SPI-M, which advises the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies .Prof Ferguson told the committee that despite border screening at the early stage of the pandemic, probably % of cases imported into the country were missed because checks were not being conducted on people arriving from Europe.Greg Clark, chairman of the committee, asked Prof Fergusonthat was because Sage had advised that it was not necessary to test those people.Prof Ferguson said: ldquoThis is really decisions by the Foreign Office and by the Department of Health and Social Care, not by Sage.ldquoSage recommended that where a country had been identied as having an active transmission, we should check travellers from those countries.He added that the dficulty was that Spain and Italy ndash the source of many infections into the UK ndash had large epidemics before they realised.ldquoWe were just not aware of the scale of transmission in Europe as a whole, Prof Ferguson said.The committee also heard that had the UK had the testing capacity at that stage, then at least screening everybody with symptoms arriving in the country would have given a better impression of where infection was coming from.:Scotlands tourism industry, pubs and restaurants set to re-open for business on July The Imperial College Covid- response team called for a full-scale lockdown in a paper on March  ndash seven days before it was implemented in the UK.When askedhe was disappointed in the delay, Prof Ferguson said: ldquoI said earlier, but in retrospect I would have much preferred it to have been taken a week earlier given that many lives would have been saved.Prof Fergusonrsquos comments were put to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty at the daily Downing Street press conference.Sir Patrick said it would be important to look back and see what measures had been most effective, and would be useful in determining what measures to implement in the future,necessary.He added: ldquoSo I think those are important scientic questions to address, and they havenrsquot yet been fully addressed.Prof Whitty said it was important to learn lessons from what had happened in the outbreak.ldquoI think a iety of dferent people are going to come

security arrangements.The Fraser of Allander institute also modelled the potential impacts on the economy.Paul Vaughan, Head of Communities and Neighbourhoods at Fe Council, said the feasibility report came at a time ldquoof unprecedented socioeconomic challenges.He said: ldquoGiven the stubborn persistence of unacceptable levels of poverty and inequality in our society, itrsquos important that we consider innovative solutions.ldquoWe are clear that a pilot of basic income is desirable, and we have described how and what would need to be done for this to happen.ldquoHowever, we also recognise that, at this time, itrsquos not currently feasible to progress to a pilot due to the very complex legislative, technical and delivery challenges associated with the institutional

Johnstone said: ldquoThis feasibility study shows that whatever the challenges to introducing a universal basic income in Scotland, set at an adequate rate, it would have a potentially hugely positive impact on health, wellbeing, poverty and inequality at a time when inequalities are being exposed by the current public health crisis.ldquoAs the world looks for ways to build back better from this

It is simply not true.She said chants of lsquoracist scumrsquo being chanted at police officers failed to take into account that the vast majority are not racist in the least and are doing their best to protect the public.ldquoYet those whorsquove tried to make that point, who have tried to calm the fervour of the seething crowds, have been turned upon, typecast as not much better than the men who killed Floyd, she said. ldquoAny deviation from the narrative of extreme political correctness, of lsquowokersquo revisionism, is interpreted as a thought crime, a perversion, and shut down accordingly.ldquoIt has been a very long time since freedom of thought felt so fragile mdash or so risky.Daniel Crilling, author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe and Bloody Nasty People: the Rise of Britainrsquos Far Right,said that by forcing the UK to confront racism at home, the Black Lives Matter protesters are placing the empire and its legacy centre stage.ldquoYet they are met with an infantile and increasingly toxic political discourse, he said. ldquoDebate is frequently derailed into arguments over whether Churchill was personally ldquoa racist, rather than the ideas and structures that shaped the behaviour of the British ruling class.Other arguments range over whether taking down the statue of Edward Colston is ldquorewriting history, rather than why Bristol taxpayers were still paying compensation to the descendants of slaveowners as late as , he added.ldquoLikewise, the right tends to respond to demands that Britain acknowledge the truth about empire asthis were primarily about blaming people alive today, or about protecting the hurt feelings of minority groups, he said. ldquoA better understanding of our history, including the crimes committed in Britainrsquos name, is essential for understanding the country we live in today, and the only way to defuse the claim that England is ided into two rival camps.Until Britain finds a way to reckon with its imperial past, this culture war will continue to burn.The Ann Widdicombe argued that history is lsquonot merely a procession of people in fancy dress fighting wars. It is crucially the story of manrsquos evolution from grunting cave dweller to serious thinker.rsquoShe said that Edward Colston - whose statue was torn down in Bristol - lived  years before slavery was abolished.ldquoA hundred years before the birth of Colston Henry VIII was boiling traitors in oil, she added. ldquoHanging, drawing and quartering was still going on for many years after Colstonrsquos death.That was the society in which he lived and the values upheld by its law. Yet he was miles ahead of his time in philanthropy, spending his vast fortune on schools, almshouses, hospitals and churches.She argued that it was as logical to tear down his statue as it would be to burn the diaries of Samuel Pepys.ldquoHistory [covers the progression] from cruelly retributive law to mercul law, from casual barbarism to care and compassion, she added. ldquoThe fools who vandalised statues last weekend have no more grasp of that than the ISIS barbarians who vandalised historic sites in Syria."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-shopper-coconut-shy","story":"WE all do foolish things we later regret.

Demand for property appears to be on the rise in most areas of Scotland, including in towns and cities.ldquoAnecdotal evidence from our agents suggests that the current lockdown restrictions have led people to re-assess their priorities when looking for a home. A garden space has become increasingly important, and with more people working from home in the future, properties with space for a home office may become more attractive.

At the Sandwick Manse, he kept a daily record for  years, beginning in , and became a recognised expert on Scotland’s weather.After Clouston’s death, the station moved around Orkney but kept going right up until WWII. Magnus Spence ran it in Deerness for almost thirty years,  – . His son, Magnus Thorfinn Spence, was Chief Meteorologist for Bomber Command during WWII. With very neat symmetry, the story now moves to the other end of the world # to the South Orkney Islands. Base Orcadas is an Argentinian weather station but it was founded in  by the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition, led by William Spiers Bruce. His grandmother was Charity Isbister, whose father Caleb owned Ness Farm, Stromness. Spiers Bruce went to the Antarctic as a scientist on a whaling expedition in  and became fascinated by the polar regions. He went on expeditions to the Arctic and, when he couldn’t get there, he went to the top of Ben Nevis, which had snow cover for  days of the year. An Observatory had been built there in  by the Scottish Meteorological Society, to try to learn more about weather patterns. The first Superintendent was RTOmond, the son of Robert Omond from Kirkwall, who became President of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Mary Traill, daughter of Professor Thomas Stewart Traill, . Omond was involved with the Observatory right from its planning stages. Ill health forced him down from the summit after seven years, but he remained in overall charge until the Observatory closed in . William Spiers Bruce had applied to join Scott’s expedition to the Antarctic. When, despite being one of the most experienced Polar scientists in the country, his application was rejected, he raised the funds for an expedition supported by the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. The Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of - is not as famous as those of Scott and Shackleton but it has been described as one of the most cost-effective and carefully planned scientic expeditions of the age. As well as establishing the weather station, the expedition brought back a large number of botanical, biological, zoological and geological samples. The house built for the men and their instruments was called Omond House. As well as giving Spiers Bruce a lot of practical and scientic advice, Omond had given a very sizeable donation to the expedition.The Ben Nevis Observatory only lasted eighteen years and only had three observers so it is strange that there is still more Orcadian involvement. According to his entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, Charles Anderson, from Moa in Stenness, was the Superintendent there after he graduated in . He quickly realised he wanted to be somewhere warmer and went to work at the Australian Museum in Sydney in , eventually becoming its director.The full version of this article can be found on page  of this week’s edition of The Orcadian. A biography Charles Anderson is available on the #People# page of www.aboutorkney. Patricia Long is a local tour guide based in Stenness, with a particular interest in social and family history.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These figures do not account for tests undertaken through the UK Government testing system.Mr McArthur who, alongside the local press, has repeatedly appealed for this information to be released, was pleased that figures had finally been made public.He said: “I welcome the decision by NHS Orkney to publish localised information and provide the public with greater clarity on the level of testing taking place in Orkney.“I have been pressing Ministers for weeks to agree to releasing testing data.  To date, despite warm words, the Scottish Government has refused to budge.“I therefore welcome NHS Orkney’s decision to follow the lead taken by NHS Shetland in making public this information.  As we move forward with ‘test and protect’, other types of information will also be needed to give people an understanding of the situation in their local area.“It is clear that transparency is key to building public confidence and the compliance we will need to see as we continue to emerge from lockdown. This move by NHS Orkney is a good step in the right direction.”NHS Orkney has sought to remind the community that testing is available for anyone over the age of five who has symptoms, and to keep up hygiene standards in order to prevent the spread of the virus.Mr O#Brien said: “It is down to the great work and commitment from all those who live and work in Orkney that we have kept positive results so low, but we must not get complacent.#As the lockdown is being relaxed and people begin moving around more freely, we will be exposed again.“To keep safe, our community must continue to stick to the hygiene and infection control guidelines.”These include:copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"more vessels but aprils gross tonnage is well down on last year ","story":"Lerwick Harbour saw a big reduction in shipping tonnage during April compared with the same month last year – although the number of arrivals was actually up slightly.A total of  vessels called, compared with  in April , but the overall tonnage dropped from , to ,grt.The deficit was partly due to no cruise ships callinglast year, although ferries, live fish carriers and oil traffic were all also down considerably.The April arrivals this year included  fishing boats,  workboats tenders,  ro ro ferries,  live fish carriers, eight oil boats, eight tugs, five tankers, five ferries and three pilot boats.The fishing vessels comprised  Shetland,  British, three Danish, two French and one Norwegian boat.For the first four months of the year the overall number of arrivals at Lerwick holds up reasonably well with  – , as compared to , in .

Photo: Dave Donaldson“Much of this increase in demand is likely to be because children are at home all day and every day, putting more demands on family budgets for food, electricity, heating and more.“Similarly parents are probably not working either and so are also at home adding to the financial strain.”Overall, the national picture has seen demand for foodbank stocks rise by  per cent in April, with a  per cent rise for children.Mr Grieve said: “The foodbank is coping well with the rise in demand. Food stocks are good, helped by food coming in from both the Scottish government through the council hub and from the national support effort organised by Tesco.“These two sources have really helped to boost our normal regular food donations coming in through local shops.“Where necessary we have also been able to buy in additional food and toiletries using the funds which we have received from many dferent sources.”SIC education and families committee chairman George Smith said the figures were “concerning” and urged anyone who thought they may be entitled to free school meals to make the necessary enquiries.Mr Smith said: “It’s obviously concerning and disappointing that there is an increased demand on the foodbank particularly from families.George Smith: #There are probably people accessing the foodbank who have never had to do so in the past#“There are probably people accessing the foodbank that have never had to do so in the past.“I would encourage anybody entitled to free school meals to be making sure they make that application“We are paying £ a day, and that goes into the bank account.”Mr Smith’s comments came as the Scottish government highlighted additional support it was providing from its £ million Food Fund.FareShare, a national network of charitable food distributors, has distributed over , tonnes of food – the equivalent of almost . million meals – since rd March, supported by £, of Scottish government funding.Now, an additional £. million of funding will help FareShare purchase more food for local authorities, community-run initiatives and frontline charities across Scotland.Mr Grieve said: “This is very welcome news as Shetland has been benefiting from the government’s support following the announcement of the initial £, funding and I fully expect that the need for this support will remain for many months to come, even when the pandemic is fully controlled.“The Trussell Trust announced today that nationally there has been an  per cent increase in demand for support during April compared with  and more alarmingly there was a  per cent rise in support for children.”Scottish communities minister Aileen Campbell said: “At this dficult time, it is more important than ever that we tackle food insecurity by supporting the work of community food distribution groups across the country who are best placed to ensure vital supplies reach those who need it most.“By working in partnership with FareShare and their partners in communities across Scotland, this extra funding will help frontline charities and community food groups provide support to even more people in need.” raquoWe were told there was no magic money tree.

Like everyone  we were gutted to have our original date cancelled.Having a big wedding isn#t important to us so we#re just doing it with the two of us and our witnesses on the beach. ️Now that things are slowly getting back to normal I hope everyone who has missed out also gets their perfect day.Finnebrogue Woods outside Downpatrick is another venue hoping to make  a year to remember for those still wishing to tie the knot.They include Lisa Reafrom Carryduff and her fiancé Josh Williamsonfrom Glengormley. The couple have been an item for three years and will exchange vows on June  having only got engaged on April , at the height of the lockdown.Lisa says the pair had never planned to have a long engagement or a large ceremony so the latest easing of restrictions means their prayers have been answered.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseLisa Rea and Josh Williamson FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappLisa Rea and Josh WilliamsonThe lockdown has turned out to be the perfect time for us to get married because neither of us wanted a big wedding anyway, said Lisa. We are bringing technology to the venue and will be livestreaming the ceremony for some family members in Australia and Canada. That means anyone who wants to be part of the day who can#t physically be present can still tune in. It will be a very small and intimate day with the people closest to us.Downing Street announced on Saturday that places of worship in England are to reopen for private prayer from June , but worship groups, weddings and other services will still not be permitted.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Education Minister sets target date of August  for some pupils to go back to schoolFuneral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in BallymenaNorthern Ireland firms moving jobs to Republic due to Brexit, MP told NI Finance Minister Murphy tweets #clarication# on coronavirus preventable lockdown claimBelfast mum Nuala Mackel loses fight for le after being struck by car,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappExceutive ministers Swann and Murphy have clashed over the coronavirus response.Jonathan BellTwitterEmailJune   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFinance Minister Conor Murphy has tweeted a clarication of his claim the Northern Ireland coronavirus lockdown was preventable had the health service been better funded.In an interview on Wednesday morning, the Sinn Fein MLA said Northern Ireland would not have had to go into lockdownthe health service had been more robust and not suffered through years of austerity.That afternoon he tweeted saying the lockdown was absolutely necessary to save lives. He did not sayhe still felt additional funding for the health service would have prevented the introduction of the draconian measures.The UUP described his clarication as feeble.MLA Alan Chambers said it made the situation worse because he singularly fails to explain why he said what he said in trying to blame the UK Government for lockdown and he has failed to retract the comments he made.Conor Murphy#s own party leader said, on more than one occasion, that we should be following the World Health Organisation`s advice on lockdown, so his failure to retract his original comments run directly counter to what they were saying. More people being infected would have meant more deaths.”Austerity policies have severely impacted on the capacity of Health and Social Care services, here and where, to respond to the Covid  pandemic. For clarity, lockdown has been absolutely necessary to save lives.— Conor MurphyJune , The Health Minister Robin Swann dismissed Mr Murphy#s suggestion better funding for his department over the years could have avoided a lockdown.The UUP MLA said no health service could have coped with the outbreak no matter how well it was funded and the measures imposed were based on similar responses from around the world. Read More Murphy claries comments after blaming lockdown on Tory austerityThe impact of the lockdown has been immense in Northern Ireland with the economy suffering a major shock with all sectors in a slump. The rate of decline experienced has been the worst in all the UK.Mr Murphy told the BBC#s Good Morning Ulster: The fact we had to go into lockdown is because our health service has suffered from decades of under investment.Read MoreAlex Kane:Opinion Murphy#s new law: Saying wrong thing at the wrong timeHe added: If we had a very robust health service that was well-resourced then it would have been fit to cope with the pandemic.The reason we had to go into lockdown - and people should understand this - is because the health service has been under resourced through austerity cuts for many, many years. So any attempt to restructure the health service is a big challenge as we still suffer from nine years of austerity.Read More Revealed: Blueprint for post-Covid healthcare in Northern IrelandLater in a tweet he said: Austerity policies have severely impacted on the capacity of Health and Social Care services, here and where, to respond to the Covid- pandemic. For clarity, lockdown has been absolutely necessary to save lives.Health minister Robin Swann said he agreed his department was under resourced but said the only way to manage the spread of the infection in NI was to go into lockdown. He said he took exception to Mr Murphy#s claim they could have coped better had the funds been available.It was not because our health service was not fit to cope. No health service was fit to cope. When we look at the pictures coming out of Italy at the time and New York - which is supposed to be world leading - no health service could have kept going in its day-to-day operations and coped with Covid at the same time.Read More Stormont let the health service down over the last decade – Robin SwannHe added: Our health service has been under resourced and is still under resourced. It#s not [the reason NI went into lockdown].The reason we went into lockdown was how we were to manage the spread of Covid- and that was the method that was used across the world.No health service could have coped.The Finance Minister was called to clary his remarks, with SDLP MLA Matthew O#Toole describing them as ‘bizarre and inexplicable. “Years of austerity have undoubtedly degraded the quality of our public services and have placed immense pressure on hard-worked public servants, he said. “But there is, to my knowledge, no evidence suggesting that the reason for the Covid- lockdown is the financing of our health service. It’s baffling, therefore, that the Minister in charge of financing our response to the Covid- pandemic, seems to have a view at odds with most other countries in Europe and the scientic community.Public messaging during a health crisis is important and, on this occasion, it seems to have gone wrong again.Read MoreLisa Smyth:Opinion Swann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSMr Swann has in the past blamed Stormont for running down the health system to an extent a scramble was necessary to find the capacity to cope with the virus.“Vital services have been underfunded, short-term decisions were preferred over long-term planning, dficult choices were ducked, staff were left to feel unappreciated, social care was particularly neglected,” Mr Swann told MLAs in May.Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill, a former health minister, responded by accusing the Conservative government of having “stripped the Executive of funding over  years”.“The impact that’s had on our health service and our public services are well rehearsed and well known to everybody. Even the fact and the condition that we were in as a health service to be able to respond to Covid- was greatly diminished because of the impact of Tory austerity over many, many years,” she said.Belfast Related ContentNews Analysis PremiumLisa SmythOpinionSwann takes first steps to ensuring a healthy future for our ailing NHSWhen Robin Swann took the job of Health Minister in January, it was dficult to imagine he could face a greater challenge than addressing Northern Ireland#s hospital waiting list shame.GalleryNorthern IrelandRevealed: Blueprint for post-Covid healthcare in Northern IrelandRobin Swann has published his plan for rebuilding the health service in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Education Minister sets target date of August  for some pupils to go back to schoolFuneral of Liam Neeson#s mother Kitty held in BallymenaNorthern Ireland firms moving jobs to Republic due to Brexit, MP told NI Finance Minister Murphy tweets #clarication# on coronavirus preventable lockdown claimBelfast mum Nuala Mackel loses fight for le after being struck by car,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Therefore the aim remains ato full-time classroom education as soon as medical guidance allows this.The department has now established a Restart Programme, with both the minister and the department set to consult with a wide range of stakeholders.

The party’s local health spokesperson said:“I welcome the news that a major shipment of Personal Protective Equipmenthas arrived in the north from China. “This equipment is worth more than poundm and includes .m respirator masks, m other masks and more than m pairs of gloves. “This delivery came about through a joint order from my party colleague, Finance Minister Conor Murphy and the health minister. “Not only is this PPE essential in our hospitals, care homes and other health and social care settings, but it will also be necessary as we move to the next phase of easing restrictions. googletag.cmd.push “This will also put our health and social care services in a better place to cope with any resurgence in COVID- which may occur. “Our priority has always been to save lives and keep people safe in the face of this pandemic.” The Executive will continue to work tirelessly to securePPEsupplies for frontline workers. That was the pledge from Health Minister Robin Swann and Finance Minister Conor Murphy as they confirmed the first consignment of a majorPPEorder from China. . million Type R respirator masks arrived in Belfast in recent days, the first instalment from this supply line. In total just over m Type R Masks have been purchased alongside m gloves . The total value of the contract is just over poundm. googletag.cmd.push The remainder of this consignment will be delivered in a phased basis over coming weeks and will be a major boost to supplies for local health and social care services. The purchase has been the result of a joint endeavour between the Department of Health, Department of Finance and The Executive Office. The two Ministers thanked staff in their Departments for their hard work in making the order possible. They also praised the important contribution of the NI Bureau and Invest NI in China in developing the supply line. Minister Swann stated:“There is intense global demand forPPEproducts so the achievement in securing this order should not be underestimated. “However, demand forPPEwill remain at very high levels for a considerable period – not just in health and social care but in other sectors too. “I have made clear thatPPEproducts will be only be issued to frontline staff after they are assessed. I am pleased to confirm that the reports on the new consignment are positive in this regard.” Minister Murphy:“Establishing a supply line with China, in the face of signicant international competition forPPE, is a signicant achievement for the Executive. This has been made possible by the collaborative efforts of the procurement teams in Health and Finance along with the Bureau in China. “At the same time as opening up a supply line with China, it is important to ramp up local supply ofPPE. Many companies have already repurposed their operations and this should be expanded to provide security of supply and create employment as we move towards economic recovery.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

On Friday, the GAA released theirto action procedures, that will allow collective training from Monday, July  and competitive games to commence  days later. There has been mixed reaction over the weekend, due to safety, the ious procedures clubs would need to enforce including the appointment of a Covid Supervisor and Health Questionnaires to be completed for any activity. The County Derry Post conducted an anonymous survey yesterday with adult club players across all codes. googletag.cmd.push Over  responses – from  dferent clubs - were received, with  percent stating they had not read the extensive document outlining the guidelines for ato play. When askedthey wouldto games on July ,  percent indicating that they would do so. Eight percent said they wouldnt, with the reminder said they were unsure. The figures are almost the same for theto training date of Monday, July , with  percent of players saying they will, with  indicating they wont and rest are undecided. Some of the reasons given ranged from not being convinced social distancing would be feasible, working on the front line and the risk it would be to both themselves and their families. googletag.cmd.push One response said that amateur players should not be playing during a global pandemic. The final question on the survey was directed at one of the greatest talking points in recent weeks, whether the GAA shouldve wiped out the entire season. Of the replies,  percent felt the season shouldve been cancelled,  percent had the view that county activity should cease to allow clubs a better window. The remainderwere content with the GAAs stance. Ballerin manager Brian Deighan commended the GAA for their handling of the lockdown, but felt there was now an element of rush with an element of risk. He admits that there is a dference of opinion within his squad, which never exceeds  players. “The younger lads dont see the risk, but older lads in certain jobs or with family members in certain jobs arent keen on it . As a management team, we are dead against it...it is either safe to play or it isnt.” Brian continues by pointing to a comment he saw on social media over the weekend. “Mickey Donnelly hit the nail on the head with a tweet at the weekend, a small club will struggle to resource all these protocols and tests.” Derry CCC are set to finalise their club championship arrangements this week, following meetings to explore the options. Nothing has been confirmed, but they structures are likely to change to allow club players at least one championship game. RELATED - The GAAsto action explained. More...

When Dungiven woman Bridie Ward sent us a s image of men lined up by soldiers outside a bar on Belfastrsquos New Lodge Road, it begged further investigation. Liam Tunney caught up with her to find out its background.The sight of men spread-eagled on the wall of a bar while soldiers search a premise is one that evokes strong emotions in this country. The Starry Plough sat halfway down the New Lodge Road in north Belfast, but was owned and run for years by Dungiven man Jim O’Kane. Although a staunchly Republican area, Jim’s sister Bridie recalled a mixed crowd at the bar in its earlier days. “There was a mixed crowd away years ago, it was a bar where everyone would meet up. People from Tiger’s Bay would have come in there before the Troubles started,” she said. googletag.cmd.push “Before the Troubles, the sea men, or the dockers, would have been in the bar. They were away at sea for maybe six weeks at a time and they had all this money so they spent it in there. “At the beginning, he made a lot of money in the bar, because when he bought it, there were always darts matches in it.” By the time the Troubles began to poison the city, though, the bar was singled out on a few occasions by the British Army. ‘Times of Troubles’, by Andrew Saunders, describes how, on one of those occasions, the bar was raided following a period of rioting. googletag.cmd.push “On the night of  May one platoon went into the Starry Plough to make arrests,” it read. “They removed thirty people for questioning and felt sufficiently threatened by the crowd which had gathered outside that they fired rubber bullets.” The bar has been rebuilt and is now named The Lodge. The Starry Plough’s owner Jim was a Republican Labour councillor in the city and his position attracted unwanted attention that regularly escalated into a physical threat. He twice survived attempts on his le, attempts that tragically resulted in the deaths of two companions, including a doorman at the bar in the s. North Belfast historian, Joe Baker, recalled the aftermath of the bomb in an article he wrote for the North Belfast News. “I remember my mother running to it screaming after it was bombed by Loyalists,” it read. “She knew that my Dad had been in it but fortunately he had left some time before to head off to another bar.” Another attack, in , on Jim’s home in Cedar Avenue resulted in the death of Bridget Breen, a -year-old woman who was babysitting for the O’Kane family. “Jim lived up there most of his le and was married up there. They had a hard time during the Troubles, it was tough in the s up there,” she recalled. Jim OKane outside the Starry Plough in the aftermath of the bomb that killed a doorman. “During the Troubles, they planted a bomb in the entrance [of the bar] and it blew up. He survived, but the door man was killed. “He also lost two homes. He lived in a beautul house, but they burned him out. They threw a firebomb in and the four boys were very lucky to survive. “The boys were sleeping one night and there was a woman who used to babysit for him. Josie, his we, was going down that evening to help out in the bar. “The phone rang a couple of times and the first time before she went out, it rang and they said, in an English tongue, ‘Oh sorry, we got the wrong number’, so they must have been looking for my brother. “He would have come home at night to have his tea or dinner and went back to the bar. She was ready to go out again and the call came through again, but they put the phone down on her. “She went on to the bar and the babysitter came in. It was one of those old houses, a big red brick house, with a front room like a sitting room at the front and a big long hall. “They threw the duffle bag with the bomb in through the front room, breaking the window. “The babysitter panicked and ran out the front door. It was the big, huge, oak door that was on the front and it fell on her and killed her. “The boys survived because the house was so big that it was just the front that got demolished and they were sleeping away at the back.” Jim died in the s, but an off-licence bearing the family name remains in place on the New Lodge Road. The effects of the bomb attacks and threats on his le left a lasting impression on the Dungiven man. “He never really got over the babysitter or the doorman,” said Bridie. “After that, when he was going down to the bar, and especially coming home at night, he always made sure he checked his car, in case they planted something on it. It was a scary time.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A student at St Patrick’s College, Maghera, Luca’s story ‘Business Crocodile’ was selected as a finalist in the - category of the BBC’s ‘Two Minute Tales’ competition. Luca’s father, Michael, said his son was taking the achievement in his stride. “He doesn’t like the limelight, but he’s quietly delighted in himself,” he told the County Derry Post. “Luca is laid back, very laid back, and he hates any sort of people looking at him. He would be quite happy for someone to say, ‘well done’ or ‘thank you’ and move on. googletag.cmd.push “He’s very non-assuming. Even when he scores goals in football, he doesn’t make a fuss.” Michael suggested Luca enter the competition after hearing about it on the Nuala McKeever show, and when the school added it to their homework tasks, it was the perfect fit. The Year  student’s love for animals formed the basis of his story, and although very imaginative, it has taken this success to spur him into action. “It’s come out of nowhere really, but he is full of imagination and he comes up with these quirky things from time to time. His teachers, Ms McAteer and Ms Laverty, have to take the credit. googletag.cmd.push “This has given him a boost and he’s started jotting down new characters and thinking of new stories on the back of it. “His mind is an encyclopaedia. He could rhyme off reams of animals and their Latin names as well. He reads about them and the dferent species, so the character probably came from that.” For now, the content of the story is a closely guarded secret around Maghera, but it will not remain that way for long. The finalists will now have their stories brought to le by actors and broadcast on The Lynette Fay Show on BBC Radio Ulster at the end of June. Overall winners in each category will have their story turned into an animation and featured across the BBC, while the runners-up will receive a specially commissioned illustration of a scene from their story. All nine finalists will see their stories and their illustrations featured in a downloadable digital storybook.

Emma McCann, from Moneymore, raised over pound, for Cancer Focus NI after taking on the mammoth task and said she was ‘humbled’ by the donations. “People stepped up to the mark and the live feed on Facebook really made a dference. I could see when the donations were coming through,” she told the County Derry Post. “I just didn’t know what way it was going to go. The majority of people are furloughed from their work, they’re worried about their jobs. googletag.cmd.push “They don’t have an awful lot of money and there’s a huge amount of worthy events and challenges going on at the minute. “There were even a few others locally that day, and people only have a certain amount of money to give but they were fantastic.” As well as being thrilled with the amount of money raised for the charity, Emma says the support she received from friends, family and neighbours. A small crowd had gathered as she reached the last leg of her challenge, something she says took her by surprise. “I knew nothing about that! I just thought with what had been going on that I was on my own, just me, John and the dog,” said Emma. googletag.cmd.push “I couldn’t get over that my friends all decided to come and support me. I needed it. They all arrived during the last km or thereabouts. Emma had set herself a target of  hours for the km cycle, but, spurred on by the support, and a healthy competitive instinct, he managed to beat her target. “I had given myself five hours and was absolutely chuffed to have been able to do it in four hours, twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds,” she said. “I was tootling along at an average of about -km per hour but I’m actually quite competitive. “I looked at the stopwatch and thought, ‘I can do this in about : or so’ and I pushed it hard the last km and I got there.” Donations for the challenge can still be made by visiting Emma’s Just Giving page at Emma’s Lockdown Cycle km.

Emma McCann, from Moneymore, raised over pound, for Cancer Focus NI after taking on the mammoth task and said she was ‘humbled’ by the donations. “People stepped up to the mark and the live feed on Facebook really made a dference. I could see when the donations were coming through,” she told the County Derry Post. “I just didn’t know what way it was going to go. The majority of people are furloughed from their work, they’re worried about their jobs. googletag.cmd.push “They don’t have an awful lot of money and there’s a huge amount of worthy events and challenges going on at the minute. “There were even a few others locally that day, and people only have a certain amount of money to give but they were fantastic.” As well as being thrilled with the amount of money raised for the charity, Emma says the support she received from friends, family and neighbours. A small crowd had gathered as she reached the last leg of her challenge, something she says took her by surprise. “I knew nothing about that! I just thought with what had been going on that I was on my own, just me, John and the dog,” said Emma. googletag.cmd.push “I couldn’t get over that my friends all decided to come and support me. I needed it. They all arrived during the last km or thereabouts. Emma had set herself a target of  hours for the km cycle, but, spurred on by the support, and a healthy competitive instinct, he managed to beat her target. “I had given myself five hours and was absolutely chuffed to have been able to do it in four hours, twenty minutes and thirty-three seconds,” she said. “I was tootling along at an average of about -km per hour but I’m actually quite competitive. “I looked at the stopwatch and thought, ‘I can do this in about : or so’ and I pushed it hard the last km and I got there.” Donations for the challenge can still be made by visiting Emma’s Just Giving page at Emma’s Lockdown Cycle km.

The plan was to bring entertainment to the war weary inhabitants of the town.This meeting would lead to the formation of St Patrickrsquos Operatic and Pantomime Society and their first production was Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter mdash a title that has dated somewhat.The public responded by volunteering as actors, stage hands, working with costumes and music.Principals and chorus rehearsed separately. Only one week before opening night did they merge, coming together for the first time on the stage of St Patrickrsquos Hall.It was advertised as lsquoA Feast of Music, Song and Dancersquo boasting  voices. Rehearsal took place in the McLean home, the cast rehearsed upstairs, while machinists and costumiers worked downstairs.Phyllis, the Farmerrsquos Daughter was performed on Sunday, May , and Monday, May , .It proved successful enough to be followed in  by other productions such as Tangles, The Enchanted Rose and Quest of Olwen.The performances, in the absence of film footage and photographs, appear to be lost in the haze of time.Tangles, described as a grand musical comedy, was performed in St Patrickrsquos Hall on Monday, June , the night before the Normandy Landings. The performance was in aid of the Down County Infirmary.The programme included cast and production notes. The actors, credited as lsquoMortalsrsquo included Michael Tomelty as Lollipop, Sally King as Princess Pansy, Lillian Lundy as Dame Mouldy, Leslie Rice as Lord Humbug and Master Michael Rea as the Inn Keeperrsquos Son. lsquoImmortalsrsquo included Peggy Halloran as Titania, Maura Blaney as Nona and Mary Gilmore as lsquoCinderellarsquo.Also included was an array of guardsmen, a chorus of fairies, village chorus, court dancers, innkeeper chorus, fairy partners, bunnies and a chorus of gnomes, who included Maureen Dorrian, Annie Murphy and June Doyle. In all, the cast numbered .The scenic artist was Mr James Maguire and the costume designer was Mrs OrsquoKelly. In charge of actors make-up were Mrs Maguire, Kathleen Branf and Mrs Gilmore.But, what was the story  With appearances from gnomes and Cinderella it may have had a little to do with fairyland.Is there anyone out there who remembers  At this distance, it is just a forgotten show, one of many that enter-tained people at a most dficult time in history.Around Lecale and where, there were a number of amateur dramatic companies, many more than today, who performed many shows. Here are but a sample.Old King Cole by May King, with nine scenes and a chorus of , was a three-hour show, staged in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, at pm on Sunday, February , .Reserved tickets were on sale from Mr Breen, Mr Fox and Mr Doris.Ballykilbeg Dramatic Society gave the public a production of Paul Twyning by George Shiels on Sunday, March , and Tuesday, March , , with a repeat performance in St Patrickrsquos Hall, Downpatrick, the following Sunday.Kilclief Parish Amateur Dramatic Club staged Shielsrsquo new comedy, The Fort Field, in St Malachyrsquos Hall in the village on Sunday, May , . They also performed it in the Stella Maris Hall in Strangford the following Friday.Killyleagh Dramatic Society presented St John Ervinersquos lsquoBoydrsquos Shop at the Belfast Dramatic Festival during the first week of September , having staged it during the late summer of that year in Strangford.On the night of Sunday, November , , you could treat yourself to Stars over Ballynoe, an all-star iety concert in St Patrickrsquos Parochial Hall, Ballynoe, with Alister Dick, the famous Irish tenor, Alfie Donnelly, Irelandrsquos funniest comedian, the Legamaddy Dancers and the Portaferry Hawaiian Band.

Hopefully, therersquos more to come, he said.Joersquos latest work is QUINN - No Place to Hide, a standalone follow-up to a successful launch of the first in the series. The title is dedicated to his great grandfather, Sam Quinn, a man Joe admired for the way in which he dealt with the harshness of le in Downpatrick at the turn of the twentieth century.ldquoHe worked -hour shts, six days a week, as a yard foreman at the Rearsquos bottling plant in Market Street, Downpatrick. It was backbreaking work for which he earned a pittance to feed a large family. He never complained, never took a holiday, and never ventured outside the confines of the town. He lived through two world wars, the creation of the Irish Republic, and countless other momentous times, yet he kept his head down and simply got on with his own le.Joe is quick to point out that the character in his latest book is nothing like his ancestor. ldquoAll Irsquove taken is his name. My version of Quinn is that of an international assassin who leaves Downpatrick to join the Irish Rangers and later becomes a gun for hire in America. Talk about two dferent worlds! Perhaps though, therersquos a bit of parallel in that I transferred old Sam Quinnrsquos stoicism and relentless nature into a make-believe cut-out who lives his le by those very ideals.With a -year background in journalism, it was hardly surprising that Joe wanted to keep writing when he switched careers in  to head up Down Business Centre, a support enterprise agency to help promote start-up businesses.He said: ldquoI loved the interaction with local entrepreneurs, but the writing bug doesnrsquot go away. I had always an idea for a book and couldnrsquot stop scratching the itch. After a few years, I decided to put it into action.That first book mdash SOMEONE HAS TO PAY mdash was a product of the Northern Ireland Troubles. It is set in the unlikely surroundings of Bishopscourt, a former RAF base just outside Downpatrick, and features a British government elite squad assembled under the relative anonymity of the old complex for the purposes of waging a final shoot-to-kill war against the IRA.Joersquos own assessment of the story brings a wry smile. ldquoItrsquos a far-fetched idea, isnrsquot it  It couldnrsquot have happened, could it  Thatrsquos the essence of the storyteller and I guess itrsquos why I love doing it.A recurring theme in Joersquos books is that he likes toin a mention of his hometown whenever possible. Yoursquoll find Downpatrick cropping up a lot in background narratives, or as the setting for a few hair-raising episodes that attempt to weave their way into the history and fabric of the area.ldquoItrsquos just something I like to do. Irsquom a Downpatrick man and I have the urge to shout about it when the chance arises. Wersquove a lot going for us in this area and it can only do good to let the world know wersquore here.One of his other books SPENT FORCE, which was a crime thriller set in the West of Ireland and featured a fading Garda detective, attracted praise from two signicant sources. One was Ken Bruen, the international bestselling author of the Jack Taylor Irish crime series, who wrote: ldquoSometimes a book comes along that you instantly know......damn, I am now going to have to read this all over again for the sheer joy of the narrative. It means that I will have to swear off other books for a time as very few can provide the utter joy and delight of Joe McCoubreyrsquos superb novel.Another unexpected source was a serving Garda sergeant who posted a glowing review on the Amazon . ldquoA top-class novel which deserves high praise. I am from Irish law enforcement and this novel is as close to a real-le investigation as you can get. Gripping from start to finish, totally believable characters, strong storyline, Highly Recommended.Joe admits he was floored by the feedback. ldquoOn the one hand there was an endorsement by perhaps Irelandrsquos foremost crime thriller author, while on the other there was vindication from a policeman that the research and effort to get things right had paid off. Itrsquos what any author craves, and itrsquos what makes you want to get back over the keyboard and start into the next adventure.That next adventure is taking Joe back to the West of Ireland to team up again with his favourite Garda detective. The sequel is provisionally titled FORCE OF NATURE which delves into the murky world of a serial killer. Not surprisingly, Downpatrick features heavily again.ldquoYes, the killerrsquos first three victims are young girls from Downpatrick. The story will move from here to Westport and back again. Irsquom still not sure how it will end, and thatrsquos as much an appeal to me as it is to the reader.Joe explains that hersquos not a dedicated story plotter. ldquoI use a broad brush. I get an idea and just run with it. I donrsquot like to be confined to structure from start to finish, with the result that Irsquom not quite sure where Irsquom going from one chapter to another. I think of it as being spontaneous, which means I usually go off on tangents that keeps things fresh and moving along. Itrsquos a seat-of-the-pants alternative to being a plotter.Joe publishes all his books under his own publishing house, Inishfree Communications, which also offers support to local writers. To date, he has helped eight others to complete their author journey ndash between them they have published more than  titles. He provides proofing, formatting, and design services, including suggestions on the most effective covers for inidual books.ldquoItrsquos a big part of what I do these days, says Joe. ldquoThere are lots of budding writers and independent authors out there who just need a bit of extra help and encouragement to bring their work in front of the masses. I get as much of a kick out of seeing these books go on sale as I do from my own works.Joe McCoubreyrsquos books are available as paperbacks or eBooks on the Amazon and Barnes  Noble s..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Call for hedge removal after near miss  ","story":"AN overgrown hedge close to a BT exchange in Killyleagh is being blamed for a near miss involving a pedestrian and a bus last week.A woman who was forced to step on to the main road to avoid the hedge was almost struck by the vehicle as it passed, leaving both her and the driver shaken.BT has confirmed that it plans to cut the hedge this week, but local councillor Billy Walker said the telecoms giant must go further and remove it completely.He said there was a wall behind the hedge, suggesting that once the hedge is removed, BT would only have to build a small fence on top of it to secure its base.ldquoThe overgrown hedge has been an issue for many years and there have been countless near misses involving people who have had to step off the footpath to pass, including mums with prams. What happened last Friday is the final straw as far as I am concerned, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe only sensible solution is to remove the hedge in its entirety. To do so would not cost a lot of money, but would save lives as at this time of year as people would not have to walk on a busy main road to pass.Cllr Walker says he has raised the issue with the telecoms company over the years, but was told the hedge could not be cut back as it was the nesting season.ldquoMy biggest fear has always been that someone could end up getting killed or seriously injured at this part of Killyleagh. While I am thankful the woman who stepped off the footpath last Friday was not seriously injured, this must be the last incident of this kind, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI am appealing to BT to do the decent thing and finally remove the hedge. We have been fortunate up until now no one has been injured, but I shudder to think what could happen at this location.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThis situation is a major accident waiting to happen, but it can be avoided by simply removing a hedge. It is s no brainer and I hope BT will agree to my request.A BT spokesperson said the organisation was sorry to learn of the distress that the hedge may have caused and would be in contact with Cllr Walker directly.ldquoThe hedge is scheduled to be trimmed back this week.

Some people have looked at Everest and thought climbing it is necessary. Others call those people crazy.Everesting is described as ldquofiendishly simple, yet brutally hard. Ride hill repeats on any hill anywhere in the world mdash or on Zwt, the virtual cycling simulator mdash in a single activity until you climb the equivalent height of Mount Everest.The concept was created by Hells , who also control the induction into the Everesting Hall of Fame. Website Everesting.cc contains the rules to follow.Well, call me crazy, but I did it. No, I didnrsquot fly to Nepal and climb the actual mountain. Irsquom not a former pro athlete or extraordinarily gted human, nor am I an adventure adrenaline junkie looking for a fix. Irsquom just a  something mdash  to be precise mdash son of God who has a family, a job, a dog, a bicycle, and I landed myself in the Everesting Hall of Fame. And you can too.I decided to use the challenge to help raise funds for mental health organisations Aware and Ballynahinch Counselling Service, or The Hub, as itrsquos known locally. My initial target was pound but I was astounded and humbled by the generosity of people. In the end donations totalled pound,.I chose to start at am so I could have family support at the finish. Despite the early start I was joined by my we, Jennie, and through the day she was a great support, bringing me fresh drinks and relaying messages of support.I turned on my favourite music playlist and hit the hill with a measured effort that I thought I could sustain for hours. I planned a bidon of sports drink for each ascent, as well as -g carbs per hour. Real foods early in the ride and gels and sugary drinks for later in the ride.The first three or four ascents felt strangely comfortable, averaging  minutes up each time. I was almost an hour ahead of my estimated -hour schedule by midday. I later noticed some friends,, who were tracking my progress, were saying how strong I was riding and hoped that I wouldnrsquot pay for it later.They were right! Ascents six and seven were so tough, even to the point where I felt physically ill, and my times were now over  minutes per climb.vEveresters add the tag lsquovEverestingrsquo to their Zwt profile name which means anyone on the course that sees it knows you are vEveresting and many will ride with you, congratulate you, give you a thumbs up, or just encourage you to keep going.These wonderful sherpas made it a much more enjoyable experience, especially during the sixth and seventh ascents when it was dficult to want to keep riding and my butt was telling me that I was crazy to push on.Despite wanting to reach the finish as soon as possible, I had to listen to my body, and so I stopped for some food and a bit of a rest. Another quick shower, kit change and application of chamois cream, and I was ready to continue.I was joined online this time by good friends Nathan Mullan and Stephen Hanna, both from Dromara Cycling Club, and Sam Carmichael and Nigel Bradley, from my old club, Northwest CC. Seeing them there gave me a real boost and that combined with knowing I had the end in sight really spurred me on to the finish.The final  metres of climbing were the best - I was getting messages of encouragement from Zwters from places as far away as Germany, USA and Colombia. I finished shortly after pm, over  hours after I first leapt into the saddle and boy did I sleep well that night.So to finish, Irsquod like to say a huge thanks to everyone for their support, to those who donated in such hard times mdash Irsquom so grateful and Irsquom hopeful we will make le that little bit easier for others.I havenrsquot put any thought into the next challenge mdash on Sunday I said never again mdash but the beauty of cycling is therersquos always the next time.

Thatrsquos something our whole extended family embraces.ldquoItrsquos going to be bittersweet but we are happy for Mary and the lovely couple who are adopting her. Itrsquos good to know that she will be going to her forever home and will have a lovely little le. Thatrsquos always the ultimate aim for a child, particularly a younger child.ldquoHowever, one of the challenges is trying to teach her about adoption. How do you teach a three year-old that she will be leaving us and going to a forever family  We had to be creative and came up with the idea about the Christmas elf. Like many houses, we had Bauble the elf at Christmas, who was then lsquoadoptedrsquo by Mary and now lives with us all year round and is part of our family. We even made an adoption certicate to show her it was real.ldquoWhile Covid- has put a hold on this for now, we still have to prepare both Mary and ourselves, as it will be hard to say goodbye. But, as our daughter keeps saying, itrsquos part of foster care and what is right for Mary.ldquoEveryone has been writing their goodbye letters to her. We have prepared a book about her time with us and videos so that she wonrsquot have any gaps when shersquos looking back on her le.The Dicksons have been fostering since  and have looked after eight children so far, ranging in age from one to eight. They do respite fostering ndash temporary childcare for another fosterer or family ndash and short-term foster care.Itrsquos something that the couple have wanted to do for a long time.ldquoI wanted to foster for as long as in my early twenties and my husband felt the same, said  year-old Tanya. ldquoWe both came from family backgrounds where close relatives were in the caring professions.ldquoWe were very united in knowing that we would foster one day, even from the day we were married. However, when our daughter Hannah came along, we wanted her to be part of it, obviously, and to wait until the time that we were sure she understood the impact of it.ldquoWe waited until she was about  before we contacted the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Thatrsquos where our journey started, and we havenrsquot looked back once. The Trust has been with us every step of the way. The only regret we have had about fostering is not doing it sooner.The Dicksons have also been supported by their nearest and dearest in doing something that many other people consider doing.ldquoWe were lucky that our families were always on board with us regarding our fostering, Tanya said. Our employers have been amazing, our church family and even the village family of Crossgar. Everyone has really embraced our fostering journey.After making contact with the Trust Tanya, who works at Kilmood Early Years Playgroup, said that after a period of assessment and training they began to foster six months later.ldquoI think the assessment can put people off, but I believe itrsquos an invaluable tool as you come out of it knowing yourself better, she explained. You know your own personal qualities better and your skill base.ldquoItrsquos also essential as it helps the Trust match children with dferent needs with dferent foster carers. The only thing we stipulated is that any child we cared for would be at least two years younger than Hannah as we wanted her to be the eldest child in the house.Hannah, who is a student of Saintfield High School, has been integral to the couplersquos success as foster parents and has relished her role as lsquobig sisterrsquo.Mrs Dickson said: ldquoHannah has been so great with the children. With Hannah maturing, she is showing her experience of fostering in a very positive and beautul way by showing empathy to others.ldquoThatrsquos something she would never have experienced had we not fostered and she feels more grateful for her family le. She wants to be a nurse and I can see that great caring spirit being fostered in her care of Mary. Itrsquos been so rewarding and has changed us completely for the better.Unlike many first-time parents, Tanya said foster parents always have help and support available.She said: ldquoEvery child that comes through our door is dferent and you adapt accordingly for whatever that child needs. We have the support of a link worker, who has had a lot of training. Yoursquore never on your own.ldquoWe have learnt to take things at a childrsquos pace. Some children who have been looked after before are used to being more independent and self-sufficient.

Republicans are already planning a memorial on council property in Castlewellan and it is believed that loyalists in Ballynahinch may erect a memorial to dead UVF terrorists on council land at Langley Road.KILLYLEAGH ndash A new community forum, to represent the interests of a wide range of groups in the Killyleagh area, is to be set up.The umbrella organisation will represent what has been described as the ldquoimpressive level of community activity in the area.The idea to create the new group was floated at last weekrsquos annual meeting of the Killyleagh, Shrigley and District Town Committee by secretary Peter Bryson.He said the new group is vital to enable better communication and planning and help with the compilation of joint funding applications to a range of funders.He said the creation of the new group could provide the perfect  on which to develop partnerships of shared interest in the Killyleagh area.SAINTFIELD mdash As the controversy over the dangers of mobile telephone equipment continues, Saintfield residents have found themselves at the centre of the most recent debate.Parents and councillors met in the local library last week to discuss their fears of two telecommunications masts at Comber Road, which they believe are casting a shadow over the local high school.The public meeting was called by mother-of-three Laura Bill in the wake of the independent Stewart report which advises parents not to allow their children to use mobile phones, and pointed to children as being most likely to be affected by possible health risks.Leukaemia is one illness which reports have suggested could be caused, or aggravated by, radiation from mobile phone masts.One woman told Thursdayrsquos meeting that a pocket of seven children under  years of age suffer from childhood leukaemia in the Saintfield area, leading to parental fears that this could be aggravated by the existence of the masts.BALLYGOWAN mdash A shooting incident in Ballygowan during the early hours of Monday is being linked to a paramilitary feud.The house at Comber Road was sprayed with automatic gunfire by four men who smashed a number of windows. One of the weapons police believe was used in the attack was an AK  assault rle.No one was injured during the incident which is being linked to an ongoing feud between the LVF and UVF.A police spokesman confirmed yesterday the gunment made off in a white-coloured Ford Mondeo car which had a taxi sign on the roof.The vehicle drove off along the Comber Road in the village and into Comber where it was abandoned and set on fire at the rear of the Leisure Centre.Detectives investigating the incident have issued an appeal for information and want to hear from anyone who may have seen people acting suspiciously in the vicinity of the house at Ballygowan to contact them.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Members of Edengrove Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch have said farewell to the Rev Trevor Steele, who is taking up a new appointment in Ohio.Last Sunday morning, Mr Steele and his family were presented with a number of gts by the congregation to thank them for their service and contribution to the le of the church.Along with his we Carol and children Andrew and Joanna, Mr Steele is moving to the United States after accepted a call to McCord Road Congregational Church in Toledo where he begins his ministry next month.Mr Steele has been in Ballynahinch for the past five years after accepting a call to join the congregation at Edengrove while he was assistant minister at Carrickfergus Presbyterian Church.GAA mdash Peter McGrathrsquos job as Down football manager is safe, for the time being.

likely to delay the redevelopment of the huge site, traders and politicians are keen to see work starting on the eagerly-awaited economic regeneration of this historic part of the town.The local council and the Department for Communities are spearheading an ambitious regeneration project with the new brochure mdash understood to be still in draft form ndash designed to provide potential developers and other interested parties with an overview of the sitersquospotential and secure expressions of interest.A number of Irish Street businesses have already invested in upgrading their respective shop fronts while the former police base was recently given a fresh coat of paint as part of a revitalisation scheme.The development site stretches as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue and is also adjacent to the Irish Street car park, with council officials looking to make the brochure available to the pubic virtually.Described as a strategic and prominent location in the heart of Downpatrick, senior council officials, politicians and members of the business community are excited at the Irish Street sitersquos development potential.While the imposing former police station enjoys protected status and cannot be razed to the ground, it is hoped that potential developers will be able to come with an imaginative plan for the building.It has been identied as a development opportunity site in the Down Area Plan, with the area to the front included in Downpatrickrsquos conservation area.While it has been suggested that housing could form part of any redevelopment proposal, the building has been touted as a potential base for offices.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are keen to revitalise Irish Street and hope its redevelopment will act as a catalyst for the wider economic and social regeneration of the town.They are keen to retain Irish Streetrsquos uniqueness where residents and traders live and work alongside each other and ensure that there is adequate parking. There have already been suggestions that an underground parking facility at the current Irish Street car park would allow retail units to be built on top.Work was recently completed on a protracted public realm scheme in Irish Street and it is hoped that the redevelopment of the former police base will complement this project, which resulted in the provision of new granite paving, street furniture and lighting.Downpatrick councillors are keen to see the redevelopment proposal increase the number of shoppers to the town to provide a boost for existing traders who have been at the heart of the townrsquos economy for many years.It is also hoped to regenerate the town centrersquos night time economy with politicians eager for the Irish Street scheme to create a number of much-needed new jobs.Earlier this year, a number of Downpatrick councillors were given the opportunity to view the inside of the former police base and the expansive grounds to the rear.Local council officials say they are committed to working with the Downpatrick business community, residents and other stakeholders on the redevelopment of the Irish Street site and had been planning to meet with them to discuss the way forward prior to the coronavirus pandemic.In addition, the local authority aims to work alongside local people on the redevelopment proposal.Leading High Street brands including Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains have previously expressed an interest in the Irish Street location which is the last large scale development site remaining in Downpatrick town centre. However, it remains to be seenthat interest remains given the current economic climate.Downpatrick councillors say that they recognise the Irish Street regeneration project provides an opportunity to regenerate the town centre and provide a boost for existing businesses and hope that the project can be progressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Minister asked to give assurances on bypass  ","story":"STORMONT roads minister Nichola Mallon has been asked to make it clear that delivering Ballynahinchrsquos multi-million pound bypass remains one of her key priorities.The appeal has been issued by South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former minister at the Department of Infrastructure mdash who is keen to see work starting on the poundm project.When he was at the helm of the Stormont department, Mr Hazzard signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December .Since then, there has been major progress to deliver the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The bypass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with major new roundabouts proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road.Mr Hazzard said while the coronavirus pandemic has consumed much time for all government departments, he does want to diminish Ms Mallonrsquos role in working constructively with her executive colleagues in mitigating the worst effects of the global emergency.But he said since that taking over the reins at the roads department five months ago, the minister has issued statements on electric bikes and hydrogen buses and what he described as ldquoplenty of positive soundings on other capital projects, but there hasnrsquot been a single word on the long overdue Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThis is a relatively low-cost, yet strategic infrastructure scheme that is shovel ready. Yet it hasnrsquot featured in any of the ministerrsquos public commentary on her departmentrsquos priorities for the time ahead since taking office in January, said Mr Hazzard.ldquoIt is unsurprising then that local businesses and commuters are beginning to question the infrastructure ministerrsquos commitment to deliver this scheme.The MP says he has once again asked Ms Mallon to definitively set out that the Ballynahinch bypass remains a priority for her department and set out a timeline for commencing construction.He added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the successful delivery of this project will be a vital step in improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our local community in these dficult times.In a letter to Ms Mallon, the South Down MP said the bypass scheme is at an advanced stage and is as close to ldquoshovel ready as any other project in the government departmentrsquorsquos capital programme.He has asked the ministerthe Ballynahinch scheme remains a ldquopriority capital project, what stage is it currently at and when will construction work be signed off Responding to Mr Hazzard, a spokesman for the roads minister said that while she is currently faced with ldquoserious and challenging budget constraints, she has already stated that she is committed to working to find solutions that deliver better for communities and improve lives across the North.ldquoShe very much recognises that many in the local community support the provision of a bypass in Ballynahinch, the spokesman continued.ldquoIn finalising budget decisions, the minister is focused on addressing the need to fund essential infrastructure work, promoting a green recovery and getting other strategic projects underway.The spokesman said that in particular, Ms Mallon is considering her long term priorities for strategic road improvement schemes and how they might facilitate complementary improvements to promote sustainable travel choices, connecting people and communities, creating thriving and liveable places that enhance opportunities and our economy.The spokesman added: ldquoThe minister understands the frustration among the people of South Down at the failure of previous administrations to deliver important projects.ldquoShe has already set out her ambition to address regional imbalance with the delivery of projects and hopes elected representatives from across all parties and across the Executive will support her in securing the money to deliver strategic projects which improve both our economy and the wellbeing of our local communities in South Down and across the North in these dficult times..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"National Trust sites reopen  ","story":"A NUMBER of local National Trust properties reopen from today.The National Trust has confirmed that Saintfieldrsquos stunning Rowallane Garden and Castle Ward and Mount Stewart mdash both on the shores of Strangford Lough mdash will be welcoming visitors after being closed for a number of weeks as part of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.In total,  properties are reopening across the province, with Trust officials confirming that advance bookings will be required in order to limit numbers and maintain public safety.

Funding opportunities are being explored and while this work will also have been interrupted, I hope that it will resume in the near future.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one offering and

But, despite, a large amount of public land and pathways available to link these community assets, these attractions are poorly connected.Mr Hazzard said he has asked the local authority to ldquourgently look at rediscovering the public value of disused railway lines, abandoned riverside paths and overgrown public spaces in developing a Downpatrick greenway project that would help breath new le into redundant community infrastructure.ldquoLinking these wonderful local attractions would also help create exciting new public spaces where people can relax, enjoy nature or exercise, he continued.ldquoDelivering a greenway initiative would not only represent an exciting investment in our local tourism offering, but help create multiple, long-term employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, providing a strong  to build a much-needed, vibrant weekend and evening economy in the town centre.Mr Hazzard believes that developing greenways has the potential to make a huge dference to the lives of local people by providing the opportunity to enjoy traffic free access to fresh air and exercise.He is also confident that the initiative would encourage more workers and children to commute to work and school on foot or by bicycle and help provide a vital leisure resource for local people and visitors alike for generations to come. ldquoThe Covid- pandemic and subsequent lockdown restrictions has exposed the importance of community trails and public spaces to our collective well-being as a society, Mr Hazzard continued.ldquoOver recent weeks, our country roads and parks have been full of people seeking respite from isolation in the green, community infrastructure that ordinarily binds our communities together.However, it is clear that this infrastructure lags well behind many comparative regional, national and international locations.ldquoThankfully, however, unlike most major infrastructure projects which can be quite expensive and take the best part of a decade to complete, community green infrastructure can be delivered much quicker and at much less of a cost to the public purse.Mr Hazzard says he is confident that a new greenway project in Downpatrick represents an ldquoexciting opportunity on so many levels and deserves serious consideration.He added: ldquoI look forward to discussing this proposal with senior council management in the weeks ahead..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/18460262.sr-theresita-osullivan/resources/images/11462458.jpg","title":"stay safe meeting group latest lockdown rules","story":"Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week that in EnglandIn ScotlandIn WalesAnd in Northern IrelandEstablish ground rulesKeep everything outdoors where possibleKeep your distanceAvoid sharingMasks, wipes and sanitiserThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Supreme Court held that the interim custody ordermade in relation to Mr Adams was not lawfully made.

Photo: PA WireArticle  of the Detention of TerroristsOrder  authorises a secretary of state, minister of state or under secretary of state to sign an ICO. As minister of state, I was one of the ministers authorised by that order to sign, and thus to make, ICOs. The Supreme Court’s judgment does not say which minister of state signed the ICO in relation to Gerry Adams. As I say, it may be that my signature was on some of the ICOs made in this period, although they could have been signed by David Windlesham or Paul Channon. Most likely, they would have been signed by David Windlesham as he was specically assigned by Mr Whitelaw to oversee security issues, although we all worked together as a team on all aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration. I note that it was David Windlesham who on  December  moved the motion in the House of Lords that the  Order be approved. He remarked then that “applications for interim custody orders are by no means automatically granted by the secretary of state.Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore, a Justice of the Supreme Court of the UK and former Lord Chief Justice in Northern Ireland, who read out the unanimous judgement in the Gerry Adams case. Photo: Supreme Court PA WireThere is a thorough process of scrutiny before he, or anyone on his behalf, decides whether or not to sign one at all.”It is clear to me that the Supreme Court has misinterpreted the nature and scope of the  Order. The court misunderstands the signicance of Article , which specically provided for a minister of state or undersecretary of state to sign an ICO in the name of the secretary of state.This provision was understood by government in making the order and in exercising it, and by Parliament in the debates about whether to approve the order, to authorise the minister of state or under secretary of state to decide whether an ICO should be made. In so doing, weacted in the name of the secretary of state, who was responsible for the Northern Ireland Officeand the ministerial team and who was, of course, closely involved in many ICO decisions himself, as well as directing which ministers should oversee which aspects of Northern Ireland’s administration.The fundamental failure of the Supreme Court’s judgment is its total misunderstanding of the nature of ministerial and departmental government and methods of operating. A junior minister on duty at Stormont is in effect the persona of Her Majesty’s government and is thereby empowered to act for and as the secretary of state in the latter’s absence. And the secretary of state was often unavoidably absent. In relation to Northern Ireland, it was inherent in the nature of direct rule that the secretary of state had to be frequently in London – in Parliament or the cabinet – and that his responsibilities would often have to be exercised by a junior minister on the ground.On the weekends, one of us was always the duty minister. One minister always had to be available to Parliament, including to answer urgent questions. And those of us who were members of the House of Commons had also toto London frequently to vote .When the order was made, on  November , and when it was approved by Parliament in December , it was certainly contemplated that there would often be cases in which an ICO would need to be made by the minister of state or under secretary of state rather than by the secretary of state himself. The order clearly provides for this to happen. The high number of ICOs that the government anticipated would have to be made, and were in practice made, also helps explain why the order provides that junior ministers may order temporary detention. The Supreme Court’s assertion that it would not have been dficult for the secretary of state to consider each case personally and to make each ICO himself simply does not match the reality.As it happens, almost all signing of ICOs, where the actual signing of the document took place in Stormont Castle, was discussed directly with other ministers and usually with the secretary of state by telephone or message,he had to be in London or his constituency home in Penrith.The secretary of state could not always be directly involved and even when involved in some cases it would often be the minister of state or under secretary of state, in Stormont, who had reviewed the grounds for making an ICO in detail and who was satisfied that an ICO should be made.The minister on duty in Stormont was fully entitled to act in the secretary of state’s name. Other ministers were consulted, to the extent possible, not because this was what the law required, asthe junior minister were simply the mouthpiece of the secretary of state , but because that is how any team of ministers, operating as a team, would act in relation to important matters with political implications for which the secretary of state would have to accept constitutional responsibility.In any case, in relation to Gerry Adams one can be absolutely sure that it would have been discussed most fully and confirmed by the secretary of state before the ICO was made.The political salience and security implications of detaining Mr Adams would have made this unavoidable.I do not know whether there is a record of the secretary of state’s involvement in this case or any other case in which his signature does not appear on the ICO itself. The Supreme Court’s judgment implies not.This may be unsurprising in view of how ICOs were often made, which is to say by a minister of state or under secretary of state in Stormont, with the secretary of state often consulted by message or telephone from London or Penrith, but without a record of that involvement necessarily being kept or now being available. There would have been no reason, and perhaps no capacity, to record the secretary of state’s personal involvement, save in those cases where he himself signed the ICO, because Article  authorised the minister of state to sign the ICO and this signature had itself to be sufficient to authorise detention on the ground in Northern Ireland.But it is a travesty to conclude that because ministers complied with the terms of the  Order, and did not go above and beyond it to somehow record the secretary of state’s involvement, the ICO must now be quashed and the detention ruled unlawful.It is quite startling to see the Supreme Court reasoning that the prosecution had failed in Gerry Adams’s case to prove that the secretary of state had personally authorised his detention. The shape of the  Order makes very clear that an ICO signed by a minister of state or snder secretary of state is the same as an ICO signed by the secretary of state himself and authorises detention. It would have been utterly unworkable for the Royal Ulster Constabulary to have refused to detain suspected terrorists unless and until proof had been provided that an ICO signed by the minister had also been personally considered by the secretary of state. Or for commissioners determining whether there should be continuing detention to have held that they did not have jurisdiction unless and until the secretary of state had provided evidence that he had personally considered whether to make the ICO in question.This would have made the scheme of the  Order simply unworkable. The Supreme Court’s reading of the  Order was not what government intended, or understood, or what Parliament approved. The whole point of the signature requirement in Article  is to make clear who is authorised to make an ICO and thus whose signature on the face of an ICO makes it lawful to detain the person in question.The making of ICOs in -, which the Supreme Court has now denounced as unlawful, was entirely in line with the law, with the wishes of Parliament, with normal ministerial practice and with the immediate security needs of protecting the public from acts of appalling violence and bloodshed . Like Professor Ekins and Sir Stephen, I take the case for legislation to overturn the effect of the Supreme Court’s judgment – to make clear that ICOs signed by a minister of state or under secretary of state were lawful — to be overwhelming. In so legislating, Parliament would be reaffirming its clear, obvious and original intentions and the absolutely normal practices of departmental governance and ministerial responsibility.• Lord Howell of Guildford is the last surviving member of the ministerial team in the Northern Ireland Office, with responsibility under the Detention of TerroristsOrder .

in one of his articles that such a progressive town as Penarth was without an operatic and dramatic society, writes Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Societypresident, Mary Gardner.The response to his outcry was quickly taken up and within three weeks the Penarth Operatic Society was formed.The Societyrsquos first production was Gilbert  Sullivanrsquos Iolanthe, played at The Hippodrome which later burnt down, and what a glittering opening evening it must have been as the audience wore evening dress.The review featured next day read, ldquoBrilliant Initial Performance.More newsVale council issues warning over the use of parksFines increased for coronavirus lockdown breachesMarie Curie Great Blooming Tea Party goes virtualA few years later in , the drama section came into being and with it a new title of the Penarth Operatic  Dramatic Society, known affectionately as PODS.Since then PODS has progressed down through the decades with many highlights along the way.One being in  when PODS presented that great musical, The King And I, which won the premier prize at the Waterford International Festival, for which the company received a beautul Waterford crystal vase.The Town Council held a reception to honour the Society at the Paget Rooms, and James Callaghan, the local MP, paid his tribute to PODS saying it ldquoadded lustre and brought culture to Penarth.Another landmark was the play, Dear Octopus, by Dodie Smith produced for PODS th anniversary celebrations.One of our most challenging and exciting shows was Cabaret in , which won the National Operatic  Dramatic Associationrsquos award for Best Production and Best Stage Management and Technical presentation.More recently in , to honour and pay tribute to the many men who gave their lives in World War One, PODS presented the very special play, Last Man Standing, which also won a NODA award for Best Drama.In , PODS decided to do pantomime, and this has been a greatly gratying and popular addition to the companyrsquos output.Itrsquos wonderful to see children in the cast having on-stage experience, and then those children in the audience, perhaps for the first time, enjoying and loving live theatre.PODS is a very busy Society putting on four shows a year, a musical, two plays and a pantomime.Mrs Gardner said: ldquoThis year, sadly and very upsettingly after much hard work by all involved, the covid- virus struck as PODS had just set-up at the Paget Rooms ready for its run of Goodnight Mister Tom, only to be told the venue would be shut down next day.ldquoSince January, the Society had also been rehearsing for its May musical, The Full Monty, and that too has had to be cancelled.       ,params: .pushldquoNevertheless, when this terrible emergency is over the company will put on these two productions sometime in the future. ldquoPODS is proud of its achievement in giving much pleasure and entertainment to the local community with its first-class shows over the last  years, and its goal is to make its centenary in  with the help of its faithful audiences, friends and patrons.PODS is always ready to welcome new members, but at the moment it cannot meet or rehearse due to the covid- restrictions.It might be some time before restrictions are lted on groups being able to rehearse together, or audiences allowed back in theatres, meanwhile PODS members keep in touch

make face masks compulsory public transport","story":"Mark Drakeford said Englands decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel

decision to bring in a requirement for coverings had raised issues for people commuting between the two countries.It came as Public Health Wales said a further four people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total number of deaths to ,, while the number of positive cases grew by  to ,.More NewsLuxury car manufacturer Aston Martin to axe  jobsMans efforts toWorld War One Penarth soldiers plaque found in New ZealandPenarth RNLI leboat crew rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public transportthe journey is essential and theres no other travel alternative.\" article_url   content_id
