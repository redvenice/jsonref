Tom Jenkins has been taking an enforced break from action photography and pursuing a different kind of vision in his gardenI have never appreciated my back garden so much.At this time of year, I’m usually caught up with all the to-ings and fro-ings of the sporting world: taking photos of traditional spring events like the Boat Race and Grand National, or key matches as the football season builds to a crescendo. Normally I’m away a lot, not really passing an eye over developments in my garden. But this is not a normal year.It was mid-March, and I was sitting despondently in my tiny postage stamp of a garden. The previous week I had photographed the Cheltenham festival, an event I associate with the end of winter, spring coming, the light getting better. A chance to look ahead to a summer of sport, going to events that I love. But this year, the festival had felt all wrong – more like a dangerous party on the eve of war. It seemed all around me the news was harrowing, and sport was getting hammered as event after event was cancelled. My world had suddenly been turned upside-down.I realised then that I had to reframe and refocus. With all my normal avenues for taking pictures closed off, I needed to find something else. I recalled the words of Ed Jackson, a former professional rugby player whose portrait I had taken exactly a year earlier. After suffering an awful accident that had left him partially paralysed, he had developed a mental process to cope with his new situation: focus on what’s in front of you, focus on things you can affect, and try to forget what’s out of your control.Remembering this, I looked round the edge of the tiny piece of lawn and noticed some tulip bulbs that my wife had planted in terracotta pots. Lush green leaves with buds full of promise had emerged from the soil, ready to bloom. In these plants, I saw hope. I saw normality.It occurred to me then that this process of growth and positivity deserved to be documented. Despite the global madness, nature was thriving – and these tulips seemed to be begging me to tell their story. To me, photography is more than just a career: it is my passion, and in these flowers I found the perfect opportunity to take pictures without leaving my home.To test myself, I decided not to use any of my main professional cameras. These are more used to the hurly-burly of sport, all fast focusing and speedy motor-drive. Instead, I turned to what I call my “holiday camera”, an upmarket point-and-shoot that I take away on trips with the family (the last thing I want on holiday is to be surrounded by items associated with work, many of which are heavy). Light, easy to manoeuvre around the plants, and – most crucially – able to focus close-up, this small camera actually turned out to be perfect for this project.As the sun moved round the garden during the day, backgrounds became dark and shadows on the flowers created gorgeous patterns. I would note which times were best to photograph certain plants, and would periodically drop whichever household task I was doing (much to the irritation of my family) to race to the garden and catch the flowers in the perfect light.Like all photographers, I look to light as another tool in the box, an opportunity to create something different. By varying angles, I could make petals look like paper, tightly bunched flower heads look like lips. Going in tight, I attempted to show the beauty of the flowers in a surreal way. The warm spring sunshine of the last few weeks had not only ushered the tulips into full bloom but enhanced their colour and vibrancy, so some of my photographs gained an almost unearthly quality.I’ve never felt so lucky to have my garden, this tiny oasis in densely crowded north London. In the land of quarantine, my house has never felt more like a castle, defending me from the warzone outside the front gate. In that castle, my garden is the green inner sanctum, a place of peace and tranquillity.As I sit here now, in the sunshine, I hear birdsong and the rustling of leaves, with the chirruping of children playing wafting in on the breeze. The sky above my head is free from planes and pollution and a brilliant blue. The sun, bright and sharp at this time of year, makes everything look crisp. In times like these, we remember that nature truly is life-affirming, and the simple act of flowers growing means so much. It shows that in an abnormal world, normality is king."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad999f8d39c50689bd4246a37a421a12a6bfb0d0/0_231_2685_1611/master/2685.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249045b6f0c2155be1ce778b8e584916","title":"2020 gdt nature photographer of the year","story":"The German Society for Nature Photography (GDT) has selected its Nature Photographer of the Year 2020.The winning image is part of a series of photographs taken in Dortmund’s north by Peter Lindel.

Travelling eastwards from his London home, he chooses 80 trees from the 60,000 or so species on the planet. He starts with the London Plane, “a tree of pomp and circumstance”, first planted in Berkeley Square, Mayfair, in 1789. A hybrid of the American sycamore and the Oriental plane, they have set an example to urban planners around the world.The smooth bark of the beech has long been associated with writing: beech boards once enclosed vellum books and in many languages the words for this tree and for the written word are similar.Botswana is home to “one of the blobbiest trees on the planet”. The baobab can live for 2,000 years and it stores thousands of litres of water in its pulpy trunk. Its weird appearance is explained by one folk tale as due to the tree having ideas above its station: “The Creator exasperatedly flung the baobab upside down with its roots in the air.”Each tree is beautifully illustrated by Lucille Clerc using a subdued but rich palette of greens and browns, with occasional splashes of more vibrant colour. This is a wonderful tour of the Earth’s trees, revealing their unique characteristics and the vital roles they have played in human life and culture.• Around the World in 80 Trees by Jonathan Drori is published by Laurence King (RRP £12.99)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc66199f8e70cf645d1a036ece7b29579ba633f6/0_277_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cec2020d4484157ec00efd2c116da0aa","title":"i wish more people would read how to cook a wolf by mfk fisher","story":"Intended to rally home cooks during the second world war, this is food writing that addresses privation ‘with grace and gusto’‘Essential” has become the most wearing word of the lockdown. The order is to only leave your house for “essential supplies”, but what counts as essential? Every venture into public, every social contact, comes with the possibility of spreading death or bringing it back with you. “Popping to the shop” is obscene, impossible. The way of eating that I’ve learned as a comfortably-off adult – a casual, desire-led, last-minute way of eating, where I could decide what I fancied for dinner at 6 and have shopped for and cooked it by 7 – no longer works.This is hardly the first era to be forced through such an adjustment. “There are very few men and women, I suspect, who cooked and marketed their way through the last war without losing forever some of the nonchalant extravagance of the 20s. They will feel, until their final days on earth, a kind of culinary caution,” wrote MFK Fisher in How to Cook a Wolf. First published in 1942, Fisher’s cookbook was reissued after the war with Fisher’s later commentary on her work incorporated in square brackets in one of my favourite bits, she rebukes her past self for speaking only of her sons and neglecting the daughters.How to Cook a Wolf has a simple, stark purpose: to provide “a streamlined answer to the pressing problem of how to exist the best possible way for the least amount of money.” The wolf of the title is the one at the door. When I first read it, about four years ago, the message seemed quaint – not a practical guide, but a reminder to enjoy my own good fortune. I’ve never cooked from it. It lives on my bookcase, rather than on the kitchen shelf with my oil-splashed Delia and broken-backed Slater.But now, as I peer into my cupboards and calculate how long my stash of tins will last, I go back to Fisher’s book as a supplicant. Teach me how to live this way. This time, I’m listening. Of course, the idea that my privations match the ones she was writing for is itself a mark of my nonchalant extravagance. Her chapter headings include How to Be Cheerful Though Starving and the striking How to Stay Alive, which consists of directions for making a kind of “sludge” that Fisher reckoned could feed one person for a week at a cost of 50 cents.I will not be cooking sludge. (Yet.) But Fisher’s practicality makes her a reassuring companion at the stove. “Use as many fresh things as you can, always, and then trust to luck and your blackout cupboard and what you have decided, inside yourself, about the dignity of man,” she writes. This sturdy advice makes working out what to do with the last egg feel like a higher pursuit, rather than an access of desperation. She does not counsel us to eat offal out of parsimony, but because we must “savour to the fullest the beasts we have killed” (though I imagine she drew the line some way before bat).How to Cook a Wolf is a passionate argument for the necessity of pleasure. Even sludge, Fisher claims, can be made “delicious” (if less economical) by frying it in slices. And things ought to be delicious whenever possible: “Since we must eat to live, we might as well do it with grace and gusto.” To eat with delight, she says, “is not wicked sensuality”, but positively moral. It bespeaks a “thoughtful system of deliberate choice” allowing one to “weigh values, not only sensual but spiritual.”This philosophy is deeply welcome at time when “nice things” are being treated as ethically suspect. Is it acceptable to buy lemons during a national crisis? After all, you could live on sludge. But, objects Fisher, if you can eat well and choose not to, you are hardly living at all. When we “nourish ourselves with all possible skill, delicacy and ever-increasing enjoyment”, she writes, it is a way to “assert and then reassert our dignity in the face of poverty and war’s fears and pains”. That, too, is essential."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a78bc19ab85d06f90f5debf53c7625d1356b8146/0_434_4376_2626/master/4376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c426e4a7db6c56e69e5dc7440e297c2b","title":"uk delivery drivers how have you been affected by coronavirus","story":"If you work as a food or goods delivery courier in the UK, we’d like to hear about your experiencesWhether you deliver packages for online retailers or drop off people’s supermarket home deliveries, we’d like to hear how your work has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

All our restaurants will continue serving a limited menu to help the smaller kitchen teams maintain social distancing.”KFC has more than 900 branches in the UK and employs around 24,000 members of staff. Deliveries can be made via Just Eat, Deliveroo and Uber Eats.The chain is joining a growing band of fast-food companies seeking to ease back into business during lockdown, albeit not without controversy given strict social distancing requirements.Burger King, which has already reopened six sites for delivery and takeaway, is opening eight more from Wednesday, including its first ever drive-through.The UK’s restaurants and pubs are allowed to prepare food in their kitchens for collection or delivery in spite of the lockdown, and many have been providing free meals to NHS staff and other key workers.This week Nando’s reopened six restaurants in London and Manchester for delivery orders.KFC said opening the restaurants would mean that it could continue donating food to the NHS and key workers – typically 10,000 meals a week in partnership with Deliveroo alone – in addition to the 13,000 it has already donated.The UK government has said that these five tests have to be met before they will consider easing coronavirus lockdown restrictions:Paula MacKenzie, managing director of KFC UK \u0026amp Ireland, said: “I’m really proud of the way we, with our franchise partners, have been able to carefully get some of our restaurants up and running over the last two weeks.“This next stage allows us to continue to provide wider access to hot food for those who need it most, whether that’s key workers after a long shift or those working from home who need a quick, affordable dinner for the family. I’m hugely appreciative of our team members who have returned to work – it’s a challenging time for everyone, but we’re so glad to play our part in helping to feed the nation.”McDonald’s announced on Tuesday it was carrying out operational tests behind closed doors this week in preparation for a limited reopening of some restaurants.Paul Pomroy, the chief executive of McDonald’s UK and Ireland, said reopening would happen only “when we are absolutely confident we can have the right measures in place to ensure everyone’s wellbeing”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bc1876256d28fc76aed43f288c5b16bcbc828cb/0_0_5428_3252/master/5428.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e3ae4a77958cd889ba8a83dce91ddd7","title":"markets covid us economy federal reserve ftse dow business live","story":"UK stock market has hit its highest level since early March, despite coronavirus lockdown hitting retail sales and driving bad debts upHitting 6,000 points again is a “significant milestone” in FTSE 100’s recovery from the pandemic-inspired stock market slump, says Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.He gives some of the credit to Barclays, where decent investment bank trading made up for growing problems in the UK economy.”Although Barclays has attracted flak for its commitment to investment banking, this part of the business is actually performing well at a time when the retail bank is facing a significant increase in bad debts.“The £2.1bn provision for this risk in the company’s first quarter update reflects the fragility of the UK economy amid the lockdown, while big falls in revenue at advertising giant WPP offer an insight into the impact globally. Standard Chartered, the emerging markets-focused bank, has also reassured investors today despite reporting falling profits.The FTSE 100-listed lender told the City that it sees signs of recovery in its key markets in Asia, predicting:“We expect a gradual recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic ... before the global economy moves out of recession in the latter part of 2020, most likely led and driven by markets in our footprint.”Standard Chartered is also setting aside more money to cover bad loans, with a credit impairment of $956m for the last quarter.Today’s rally follows encouraging results from Google’s parent company, Alphabet, last night.Alphabet posted higher revenues in the last quarter than expected, despite a “significant and sudden slowdown in advertising” in March.Roughly two-thirds of the companies on the FTSE 100 are up this morning, pushign the index over 6,000 points.Boom! Britain’s FTSE 100 index has just pushed over the 6,000 points mark for the first time since 11 March.That means it has clawed back all the losses since the stomach-churning crash on 12 March (the worst day since 1987).Here are the top risers, and fallers, as investors continue to grasp hopes that Covid-19 lockdowns will end soon, helping the world economy to rebound.Next told the City that the drop in sales has been “faster and steeper” than anticipated in its March stress test.It now expects lower sales for both the first and second half of the year.It told shareholders this morning that customers had already voted with their feet before the lockdown:We believe that the threat of a pandemic did not significantly affect retail sales until the beginning of March, we saw a material impact in the second week of March and declines accelerated as each day went by.It is also limiting daily orders, and will shut down until the next morning when this is hit.The coronavirus crisis is bad news for the advertising industry too.WPP expects more pain ahead (understandably - you can hardly expect travel firms and restaurant groups to do much advertising right now).“The second quarter is going to be tough and logic would tell you that we had a partial impact in March and we’ll start to see the full impact around the world in the second quarter.”The rising economic cost of Covid-19 has hit profits at UK bank Barclays.Barclays is setting aside £2.1bn to cover a surge in bad debts, anticipating that its business and consumer customers will struggle to repay their loans.CEO Jes Staley pinned the blame firmly on the coronavirus:The impact of COVID-19 came late in what was until that point a good quarter. Statutory profit before tax was £0.9bn and profit before tax excluding credit impairment charges was £3.0bn. We have taken a £2.1bn credit impairment charge which reflects our initial estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Staley also warned of tough times ahead:“Given the uncertainty around the developing economic downturn and low interest rate environment, 2020 is expected to be challenging,”Job cuts often go down well in the City (they’re a pragmatic lot). Not today, though. CEO Alex Cruz told staff he was acting “decisively”to ensure that British Airways has a strong future. Unions, though, are furious that IAG is slashing staff rather than seeking government help.Michael Hewson of CMC Markets comments:One thing seems certain, while last night’s actions by IAG have attracted some significant criticism in terms of their timing, they also point to the challenges facing the travel sector in the weeks and months ahead.Will demand have picked up again, and if not, will airlines have to reconfigure cabins so that passengers aren’t crammed in on top of each other. Will air fares become more expensive, as a result of lower capacity, and will package holidays be less popular as a result.The FTSE 100 has hit a new seven-week high at the start of trading in London.The blue-chip index has gained 30 points to reach 5989 points, for the first time since Wednesday 11 March.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Today we learn how badly America’s economic growth was hit by the first phase of the Covid-19 crisis, and what its central bank will do to fight it.The threat of a deep recession has already spurred America’s Federal Reserve into a series of massive stimulus programmes. The Fed holds a policy meeting today, but isn’t expected to change monetary policy -- having already slashed borrowing costs to nearly zero.Instead, investors will be looking for signals that the Fed will continue to generously support the economy -- and thus asset prices -- until the Covid-19 pandemic is over. It has already pledged more than $2 trillion of loan guarantees and other financial help.Optimism that policymakers will keep doing Whatever It Takes have lifted the markets to their highest levels in seven weeks. Britain’s FTSE 100 is only a whisker below the 6,000 point mark, having fallen through 5,000 points last month.That reflects a lot of optimism that coronavirus lockdowns will ease, economies will return to something like normality, and a deep depression will be avoided.But given so many companies are reporting falling sales and profits, and suspending their idends, does this rally have firm foundations?Last night, British Airways laid out plans to cut 12,000 jobs -- as it responds to the collapse in the travel business.The big fear is that Covid-19 infections spike again once governments start to reopen offices, factories and schools.There are still many unknowns, perhaps too many to justify the return to a bull markets for many bourses across the globe. The true scale of the economic impact of the coronavirus is still unknown. Whilst people returning to work and economies reopening is a good thing, there is a good chance that the rally will start to stall over the coming weeks, as investors are faced with the stark reality of the hard data whilst also waiting to see if the gradual reopening are working.Investors face the same conundrum as governments will the reopening prove successful or lead back to a second wave of infections?

Yet many of them have little faith in Phillips’ ability to discover the causesCovid-19 has left many Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities particularly vulnerable: in terms of their lives, and their livelihoods.And while some of these figures may be explained in part by the fact that among BAME communities a large number have felt a vocational calling to the caring professions, it doesn’t account for the massive disparity in fatalities. Is part of the reason medical, possibly related to higher blood pressure and diabetes rates among ethnic minorities? Just as important, is it partly due to socio-economic reasons, related to poverty and lack of access to healthcare? Whatever the causes, if we are to pay the right tribute to the thousands of people who will have lost their lives – particularly those on the frontline – then we must, in an honest and transparent way, better understand why this seems to be happening.An inquiry by Public Health England has already been set up to look into this. Though it is expected to be relatively short, it should in time be able to inform a more extensive Covid-19 public inquiry. And in addition to the fatalities and direct health impacts, researchers BMG have found that BAME groups have already suffered a greater financial hit than the broader white communities – and have been almost twice as likely to have lost income and jobs. Many fear that after this pandemic things could get even worse.The inquiry therefore should be bold enough to examine inequalities in health, employment, housing and poverty in general. There are a number of traps we should not fall into. First is the growing narrative that Covid-19 discriminates, but that our political, civic and business institutions don’t. We know, for example, that a large number of ethnic minorities work in care homes, where they are low paid and possibly on zero-hours contracts. Many are faced with an impossible decision: do I stay at home to protect myself and my family, and risk having no money to pay the rent or buy food or do I go to work, probably on public transport, where I have greater exposure to the virus and am least protected? Nor should we overplay cultural and genetic factors, and claim this explains the ethnic variance in death rates.But perhaps the biggest challenge for the review will be credibility. Public Health England has given Trevor Phillips and his company, Webber Phillips, a prominent role. Yet a growing number of BAME groups and iniduals are struggling to find the trust and confidence in him that is needed for this review to be taken seriously.Although Phillips is a former head of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, an open letter signed by 100 black British women states: “Trevor Phillips is now probably more famously known by many BAME community groups as having a recent history of discarding the very real issues and consequences of structural racism in the UK.”Another letter said to represent thousands of BAME iniduals in the medical profession has been sent to Public Health England. It states: “We express our concern that Mr Trevor Phillips has been asked to provide expert support to the review … A suitable candidate who would be trusted by healthcare professionals from a BAME background must be sought.”So Phillips and PHE will have a huge task in building the requisite trust for this review to be accepted by the people it is seeking to serve.Yet none of us should lose sight of what we could achieve with a better understanding of the devastating impact this disease is having on BAME communities. We could use this knowledge to reduce racial inequalities rather than entrench them further.Much has been made of the fact this is the greatest crisis Britain has faced since the second world war. Let’s not forget that perhaps the greatest thing that came in the conflict’s aftermath was the birth of our National Health Service. Just as Africans, Asians and Caribbeans helped Britain’s war effort, so they and their descendants played a key role in creating and expanding the health service.The fact that so many ethnic minorities have now tragically lost their lives to Covid-19, many of them while caring for others, should spur us to remodel our society – so it no longer leaves so many vulnerable people facing such intolerable situations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86c32df2aa1fce581bb6c93ab9e76652218919ed/0_32_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3b9c76ff353dc1b461efb81042fda7f","title":"airlines oil giants government economy","story":"This crisis is a chance to rebuild our economy for the good of humanity. Let’s bail out the living world, not its destroyersDo Not Resuscitate. This tag should be attached to the oil, airline and car industries. Governments should provide financial support to company workers while refashioning the economy to provide new jobs in different sectors. They should prop up only those sectors that will help secure the survival of humanity and the rest of the living world.They should either buy up the dirty industries and turn them towards clean technologies, or do what they often call for but never really want: let the market decide. In other words, allow these companies to fail.This is our second great chance to do things differently. It could be our last. The first, in 2008, was spectacularly squandered. Vast amounts of public money were spent reassembling the filthy old economy, while ensuring that wealth remained in the hands of the rich. Today, many governments appear determined to repeat that catastrophic mistake.The “free market” has always been a product of government policy. If antitrust laws are weak, a few behemoths survive while everyone else goes down. If dirty industries are tightly regulated, clean ones flourish. If not, the corner-cutters win. But the dependency of enterprises on public policy has seldom been greater in capitalist nations than it is today. Many major industries are now entirely beholden to the state for their survival. Governments have the oil industry over a barrel – hundreds of millions of unsaleable barrels, to be more precise – just as they had the banks over a barrel in 2008. Then, they failed to use their power to eradicate the sector’s socially destructive practices and rebuild it around human needs. They are making the same mistake today.The Bank of England has decided to buy debt from oil companies such as BP, Shell and Total. The government has given easyJet a £600m loan even though, just a few weeks ago, the company frittered away £171m in idends: profit is privatised, risk is socialised. In the US, the first bailout includes $60bn (£48bn) for airlines. Overall, the bailout involves sucking as much oil as possible into strategic petroleum reserves and sweeping away pollution laws, while freezing out renewable energy. Several European countries are seeking to rescue their airlines and car manufacturers.Even when legislators seek to represent these concerns, their efforts are often feeble and naive. The recent letter to the government from a cross-party group of MPs calling for airlines to receive a bailout only if they “do more to tackle the climate crisis” could have been written in 1990. Air travel is inherently polluting. There are no realistic measures that could, even in the medium term, make a significant difference. We now know that the carbon offsetting schemes the MPs call for is useless: every economic sector needs to maximise cuts in greenhouse gases, so shifting the responsibility from one sector to another solves nothing. The only meaningful reform is fewer flights. Anything that impedes the contraction of the aviation industry impedes the reduction of its impacts.Governments like the UK’s should drop their road-building plans. Instead of expanding airports, they should publish plans for reducing landing slots. They should commit to an explicit policy of leaving fossil fuels in the ground.During the pandemic, many of us have begun to discover how much of our travel is unnecessary. Governments can build on this to create plans for reducing the need to move, while investing in walking, cycling and – when physical distancing is less necessary – public transport. This means wider pavements, better cycle lanes, buses run for service not profit. They should invest heavily in green energy, and even more heavily in reducing energy demand – through, for example, home insulation and better heating and lighting. The pandemic exposes the need for better neighbourhood design, with less public space given to cars and more to people. It also shows how badly we need the kind of security that a lightly taxed, deregulated economy cannot deliver.In other words, let’s have what many people were calling for long before this disaster hit: a green new deal. But please let’s stop describing it as a stimulus package. We have stimulated consumption too much over the past century, which is why we face environmental disaster. Let us call it a survival package, whose purpose is to provide incomes, distribute wealth and avoid catastrophe, without stoking perpetual economic growth. Bail out the people, not the corporations. Bail out the living world, not its destroyers. Let’s not waste our second chance.

In a CNN interview on Sunday, Moon Chung-in refuted the conjecture that Kim is seriously ill or dead, saying he seemed to be holed up in the North Korean resort town of Wonsan. The man’s just taking it easy, apparently overseeing gulags can get exhausting..If Kim really is OK it might leave some people rather disappointed. Kim’s vanishing act has pushed his little sister, Kim Yo-jong, into the spotlight. She has become something of an internet pinup (quarantine is doing strange things to us all), and there has been excited speculation that she might become the Kim family dynasty’s first female leader. This would set an empowering precedent for little girls dreaming of one day becoming lady-dictators with a passion for crimes against humanity! “North Korea … is one of the most male chauvinistic societies in the world, but bloodline supplemented by status in the Korea Workers’ party supercedes gender,” one expert told Bloomberg.It has long been rumoured that Yo-jong, who is sometimes described as the Ivanka Trump of North Korea, is the brains behind her brother’s brawn. Little is known about Yo-jong even her age is unclear, although she is believed to be in her early 30s. However, in recent years she has started to venture on to the world stage, representing Kim at the 2018 Winter Olympics and publicly praising Donald Trump. If something were to happen to big bro she’s the obvious choice for supreme leader Kim’s male relatives are either too young or uninterested. His big brother, Kim Jong-chul, seemingly stays out of politics, preferring to play guitar and obsess over Eric Clapton. Meanwhile Yo-jong has also already proved herself equal to any man: in 2017 the US treasury department blacklisted her for “severe human rights abuses”.

He discusses his fight against circumcision, his fear of Harvey Weinstein – and why he is an optimist to the core‘I’m loving the idea of being here for a sustained period of time,” says Alan Cumming, speaking over Zoom from his “country pile” buried deep in New York’s Catskill mountains. It is purpose-built for isolation. “I realised I’ve been craving it it’s a shame it took a global pandemic to make it happen.”The 55-year-old actor has been rigorous about lockdown. He is asthmatic, so he has been out past his gate only once in five weeks. Cumming spends his days with his husband, the artist Grant Shaffer, and their dogs Lala and Jerry, mostly writing. In the evenings, he has Zoom cocktails – last night it was with his old Good Wife co-star Julianna Margulies.His home is cosy: a crowded bookshelf takes up most of the wood-panelled wall behind him a blown-up cover image of his first children’s novel, The Adventures of Honey \u0026amp Leon, illustrated by Shaffer, sits on the floor. He flips the camera to reveal a small outside clearing, empty apart from his trampoline, surrounded by maple trees. A porch swing is rocking he points to a storm on the horizon coming over the Catskills.Cumming was in London when the world began shutting down. He was starring in Samuel Beckett’s Endgame at the Old Vic, alongside Daniel Radcliffe. When the theatre closed on 15 March, Endgame still had two weeks left to run. Cumming may be enjoying this period of isolation, but he is worried about what state the theatre industry will be in when the lockdowns lift. There was talk of bringing Endgame to New York, but he thinks pinning down any dates would be too ambitious.“Until there’s a vaccine, I don’t think people will really be comfortable sitting in a room with 1,000 people right next to you, coughing,” says Cumming. “I just don’t imagine the theatre or cinema as we know it is going to be able to function.”Even if people are more appreciative of the arts during lockdown, it may not be enough to stave off theatre closures. The UK and US governments have always undervalued the arts, he says – a “rot that’s set in” since Margaret Thatcher (he has more than a few criticisms of Thatcher, having just watched the five-part BBC documentary Thatcher: A Very British Revolution).“Many theatres won’t survive, because there’s so much money going into unemployment and the health service,” he says. “Not only will these theatres not have produced anything or had any income, but there’s going to be a whole range of cuts. We’re all fucked.” It is unclear whether he is referring to thespians or, well, everyone.One person he does include in his assessment is the US president. “This could be Trump’s downfall. My mother-in-law is a Trump supporter and even she’s said: ‘Oh gosh, it’s terrible what he’s doing, using all the Covid press conferences as a rally.’ It’s insane and embarrassing and just disgusting.”He will be supporting Joe Biden for president, but he has his reservations. “He’s too old. I think Trump’s too old. But we seem to still be in this culture where old white men seem to be allowed to do anything.”Cumming has one of the most eclectic CVs in Hollywood: he is prolific, versatile and prone to reinvention. As well as acting, he writes, directs and produces. He has tried his hand at photography (his latest project includes the self-portrait accompanying this article) and he is a committed activist, particularly for LGBTQ+ rights.He co-owns a queer cabaret bar, Club Cumming, in the East Village in New York, and even has his own range of fragrances (the parodic advert for Cumming the Fragrance is essential viewing). He still has five bottles sitting on a tray in his bathroom in the Catskills. “I actually spray it in the wardrobe upstairs, because we’re not here very often, so I always just give it a little squirt of Cumming.” He describes the scent as “earthy”.He has just taken over the pop star Will Young’s role as the co-host, alongside Chris Sweeney, of the Homo Sapiens podcast – in which queer people talk about queer life – which means he can cross off podcaster, albeit reluctantly.“Everyone has a podcast now!” he says. “It’s like reality TV: I used to say I just wish everyone would go on a reality TV show, so we’ll all have done it and we can get it out of our system and move on.” Yet the lure of exploring one of his biggest passions – icons of the LGBTQ+ community – was too big. Hannah Gadsby and Stephen Fry are just two of the guests on the new series it also includes an interview with Cynthia Nixon in which she talks about parenting a trans child.Cumming has held the title of queer icon since the late 90s, when he was described by the New York Observer as a “frolicky pansexual sex symbol for the new millennium”. In November 1999, he posed naked for the cover of the US’s largest LGBTQ+ publication, Out magazine. The accompanying interview was his most high-profile announcement to the world that he had sex with men and women.“I still feel everything’s kind of grey,” he says. “It’s never felt complicated, my sexuality. I’ve never had shame about sex in general or homosexuality.” This he attributes to his late father (who died of cancer in 2010), who had an affair with another woman. He wrote about this extensively in his 2014 memoir, Not My Father’s Son.“Growing up, I saw a man who was unable to control his desire. It made me feel like I’ve got a sexual appetite and it’s not a bad thing. Seeing my father struggle with this and realising that he had no control over it made me feel liberated.”Cumming was born in Perthshire, Scotland. His father was the head forester on a large country estate on the Angus coast, which is where he lived with his mother, father and older brother. His father was volatile and violent. He would mentally torment his sons by setting them ambiguous physical tasks around the estate, hitting them when they failed to match his infeasible standards.Cumming had a breakdown in his 20s – the memories of a childhood dominated by a sadistic abuser resurfacing. Together with his brother, he confronted his father. They didn’t speak for 16 years, until his father caught wind of Cumming’s intention to appear on the TV programme Who Do You Think You Are?.His father told Cumming (via his brother) that he was not his son he said he was telling Cumming this to avoid him finding out on national TV. After a meticulous investigation, Cumming exposed his father’s story as untrue (he and his brother took DNA tests to confirm it).More than five years on, he is still stunned by the feedback from readers of his memoir. Many said it helped them address their own problematic relationships. Has it allowed him to exorcise the trauma of his father’s abuse?“I thought that maybe I would put him to rest, but actually that hasn’t happened,” he says. “He’s much more in my life than he ever was. And so he should be he’s my father. Any parent is a huge part of your life and pretending otherwise is not healthy. I feel in a much healthier place with him.”Cumming laughs dismissively when asked if his globe-trotting career has gone the way he thought it would when he was starting out as a young actor on the Scottish theatre scene in the late 80s. “I was told that things were not available to me because of my Scottishness,” he says. “America was never a thing. London was maybe a possibility. The idea that I would be doing what I’m doing now or have the opportunities that I have now, there was no one I knew who’d had that trajectory … those things didn’t happen to Scottish people.”And yet his career boomed. He moved to London after a roaring Edinburgh fringe success as half of the comedy double act Victor and Barry with his friend and co-writer Forbes Masson. Their TV series, The High Life, in which they played a pair of outrageously behaved air stewards, aired on the BBC before Cumming moved to London to play Hamlet at the Donmar under Sam Mendes. He scored an Olivier award for his role as the Maniac in Accidental Death of an Anarchist, as well as a nomination for his performance as the Emcee in Cabaret he won a Tony award when he reprised the role on Broadway in 1998.More recently, he has found success on the small screen with his scene-stealing performance as the spin doctor Eli Gold in The Good Wife. In 2018, he landed the starring role in Instinct, the first network drama on US television to feature a gay leading character.As something of a Hollywood veteran (his vast filmography ranges from Goldeneye and Emma to Spice World and Spy Kids), he has expressed solidarity with the victims of Harvey Weinstein. In an Instagram post, underneath an image of Cumming and Weinstein together, he said that he had posed for the photograph despite knowing about Weinstein’s hotel room massage meetings, his rage and his bullying nature. Still, he says he was shocked by the scale of the abuse.“It shows you how clever those people are,” he says. “There’s a difference between: ‘Oh, he’s a bit of an old lech,’ and being a rapist. That was shocking to me.”Cumming was bullied by Weinstein, with the disgraced producer pressuring him to take roles he didn’t want. “I remember being at the premiere of The Hateful Eight … and I’d just said no to Harvey to doing this thing. He was very persistent. I saw him coming, he was on his phone, and I hid in this doorway to avoid them, because I just didn’t want to have to deal with them. He was scary and also he was just overwhelming as a personality.” Cumming has witnessed phenomenal social change since he started his career, when homophobia was institutional and potent. “I think it’s great things should move fast,” he says. “The constant question I used to get was: ‘Do you think that coming out is bad for your career in Hollywood?’ It’s such a ridiculous question. I don’t think people in Basingstoke or Idaho are not going to go and see a movie because someone in it is gay. I really don’t think they care.”He doesn’t miss a beat as he moves on to the latest battleground for LGBTQ+ people: gender identity. “When people get all weird about people putting pronouns at the end of their emails, I think: ‘Fuck you.’ These people are being kind to you and doing you a favour by telling you how they want to be defined.”As well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ equality and HIV charities, Cumming is outspoken against male circumcision.“I never thought anything about my foreskin,” he says, “and then I came to America and I was having sex and people would just be gasping because they’d never seen a foreskin before. I was made to feel weird and freakish because I had an intact body.“It’s genital mutilation. And I think people say: ‘Oh, that’s hysterical.’ But we do it to girls and it’s called genital mutilation.” As for the religious grounds for circumcision, he believes these are “ridiculous”: “We choose to keep doing some things and we just let the weirdest things go.”Cumming is confident that this period of isolation will result in a positive social change. “I’m an optimist at my very core,” he says. “Any time when you’ve got to be away from everybody, to contemplate, meditate and be made to understand how your behaviour affects other people, I just can’t help but think that must be a huge positive.”And what about in the immediate aftermath? “I think there will probably be a period of rabid shagging,” he says. “I’m sure there’ll be some sort of swing towards hedonism, where it’s just crazy. It’ll be like New Year’s Eve.”The new series of Homo Sapiens starts 30 April and is available on all podcasting platforms"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3cafd1ed4aad601f391461be86a0af9e27487f1/71_0_1015_609/master/1015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c82187d03502ddd3a59402fd2c7d7851","title":"great british art quiz wellington collection apsley house","story":"Set today by the Wellington Collection at Apsley House, London, our daily quiz helps you explore the collections of UK museums closed due to Covid-19.

It looks a bit odd, and a bit round.”Aerial photos of the ploughed field were unremarkable, but a Lidar image – a topographical scan using laser light – showed something that maybe, just maybe, appeared to be the ghostly image of a lost henge.A week or two later, having joined an online course run by the archaeology firm DigVentures – in part to help pass the time – Seddon uploaded his pictures to a discussion group, unsure if he had discovered a forgotten Neolithic monument, a former course of the river or a modern drainage ditch. The response from coursemates and professional archaeologists was as excited as he had hoped.While there is no way of knowing for sure without digging, says Lisa Westcott Wilkins, managing director of DigVentures, “we are very happy to say that this does indeed look like a ‘thing’”.Other known Neolithic sites nearby, the scale of the feature and the fact that historic field boundaries respect its course, all support the hypothesis, she says, that it could be a large henge – a significant find in this part of the country if so. “Of course, we are all just itching to get out there and investigate,” – just one more ambition put on hold by the current lockdown conditions.Seddon’s circular feature might be the most intriguing, but it is far from the only discovery shared by participants of the course. Developed several years ago to let students explore archaeology for the first time, or brush up on existing research, excavation and documentation skills, previous cohorts have seen about 80 participants at a time.But with almost all of this year’s excavations being shutdown because of the coronavirus crisis, the company decided to offer the course for free, and received an overwhelming response 4,000 people from 69 countries are currently learning how to read maps, draw up plans and record finds from their own laptops.It is far from the only online course to have seen a rush in interest since lockdown began, nor the only one focused on archaeology. The Council for British Archaeology and Lincoln University last week launched Dig School, an online programme of archaeology-themed workshops aimed at school children and families, devised by Carenza Lewis, professor for public engagement at the University of Lincoln and a former presenter of Time Team.But while remote learning can be a challenge in any subject, acquiring practical skills such as how to handle a trowel or dig a test pit might seem a particular challenge for participants who, in many cases, are confined to flats without gardens or limited to a brief daily spin of their neighbourhoods.Christine Green has had to temporarily close the craft shop she runs in Talgarth in the Brecon Beacons her daughter had upcoming surgery cancelled as the crisis began, “so this is a very worrying time for both of us”. Inspired by the DigVentures course, she has dug a trench a metre-deep in her back garden, in which she has found nothing more precious than a fork and a marble.“But a couple of days ago when sitting in my trench with my brush and my palette knife, I suddenly realised that I actually felt happy and unstressed – both feelings somewhat alien to me currently.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d465cec7da085d80eafdf6645f7c668104e81926/0_82_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=193011f08be87f6bbe5cc7439b55a72a","title":"shave it or save it the 11 big lockdown hair conundrums answered by experts","story":"Should you cut your own hair, cover up your roots or forgo shampoo for the coming months? And what about growing out your pubic hair? Here’s everything you need to know about home groomingGiven that we are housebound amid a global crisis, you may think that a short back and sides would be the last thing on anyone’s mind. But you would be wrong. Physical distancing has not stopped people around the world, from Phillip Schofield to Malala Yousafzai, reaching for the scissors – with varying degrees of success.Since the temptation to give yourself, or your loved ones and housemates, a quick cut appears matched only by the desire to bake banana bread, here are a few points to consider.Hairdressers advise regular appointments to keep your hair in good condition and your cuts looking fresh, so it is little wonder that so many of us are keen to keep this up. But most stylists have one word of advice: don’t.“I feel sorry for all the stylists who, after this, will be dealing with a lot of DIY disasters,” says Keri Daniel, the owner of Danique Hairdressing in Leicester. “If you really have to, then it’s worth investing in the right tools – even a professional would struggle to get a good result using the kitchen scissors. You can get cheap hairdressing scissors and cutting combs online – even razors – and they’ll give you a better finish.”With hairdressers and barbers closed, some people – Riz Ahmed and David Beckham among them – have opted to simply lop off the lot. It is quite the lockdown look, but it is not as simple as you might hope.“Think about what’s best for your household, because you have to live with these people,” warns Daniel. Like most professionals, hairdressers have a knack of making their job look easier than it is.“If you cut your own hair, you’ll need one mirror in front and one behind you,” says Stevens. “I’ve seen people using their phones, but it gets a bit tricky because you need to hold that, the comb, the scissors and the clippers. Get help if you can.”“The biggest challenge when cutting children’s hair is that they don’t like to sit still,” says Kelly V, the owner of Pixal-Rose Hair Design, a vegan salon in Swindon, who suggests keeping them occupied with a tablet or a book. For short hair, a simple cut with clippers is advised. For long hair, “brush the hair down, have the head tilted forward and cut the very, very ends off”, she says. “Don’t attempt anything too drastic.”This can be the biggest giveaway that you are overdue a trip to the salon, but there are better solutions than home-dyeing.“A zigzag parting can help disguise that regrowth line and, depending on the colour of your hair, mascara can be a great way to cover up greys,” says Stevens. “Or just have a bit of fun – we put a luminous green feather in one parting. It looked like Billie Eilish’s green roots.”Daniel suggests visiting your salon’s website to find out which products they used and investing in those. “You may be able to buy them through the salon, which can be a great way to support them while they are closed,” she adds. “Dyes that you might buy in the supermarket are not professional products, and it can make it a lot harder when it comes to colouring in the future.”“An inch of growth in afro hair doesn’t make as much difference,” says Stevens, whose salon specialises in afro hair. “It’s easier to disguise that it’s overdue a cut. Relaxed hair will have curly roots, but I would never recommend using a home relaxant – you will get snappage. You could go through it with straightening irons, but it would be very time-consuming. I would suggest just wearing your hair up.”Join the “no-poo” movement and break free from the shackles of commercial haircare! Well, it is one option – and the lockdown offers a chance to wait out the initial greasy period in relative privacy. Otherwise, shower gel can substitute for shampoo if you are desperate, according to Stevens, while mayonnaise, avocado or coconut oil can replace conditioner. “If you look at what branded products use in their ingredients, you can get an idea of the kitchen cupboard alternatives,” says Daniel. Of course, you are probably washing your hair far more than you need to anyway.“Realistically, you don’t need to wash your hair more than once a week, unless you are doing a sport or have a job in a kitchen,” says Daniel. For those of us who like to wash our hair daily, this may seem like a big ask. But she assures me it is possible. “On the third day, you could spritz it with some water and blow-dry again to give it a bit of lift. Stay away from the straighteners if you can. On the fourth day, you can start to wear your hair up. Dry shampoo and texture sprays can also give unwashed hair a little bit more life. You’re with your family and loved ones, staying home – it’s the best chance to give your hair a rest.”Removal of body hair – particularly pubic hair – is often best left to the professionals. While shaving your own legs may be straightforward, waxing your bikini line is another matter. So, is it time to go au naturel? “We’ve had lots of inquiries from clients who are midway through laser hair removal courses asking what they should do,” says Dr Chloë Butler, the founder of the Chloë Edit clinic in Worcestershire. “We advise not attempting DIY waxing, as it can be quite tricky unless you have the right equipment and patience.” While trimming or shaving pubic hair may seem straightforward, Butler believes some people would be better off leaving well alone. You may even discover you prefer your new look.“Make the right choice based on the type of skin and hair you have, not on whatever style is ‘trending’,” says Butler. “If you have a thicker hair follicle, you may be more prone to ingrown hairs or a shaving rash. If you’ve got oily skin, you may get blocked pores and irritation. Dry skin tends to be thinner and more likely to tear.” Ouch.Rather than shaving your head, Stevens suggests men try growing their hair long or cultivating a beard. If you are tempted by a complete restyle, he suggests ordering a wig online: “Walk around the house and see how you feel. What kind of reaction do you get when you’re FaceTiming friends and family?”Daniel believes that, aside from the buzzcut, other hair trends are likely to emerge after the lockdown. “It’s exciting from a hairdressing point of view. People who wanted to grow out their grey hair, or go from being very blond to a more natural colour, have an opportunity to do that.”“Ultimately, chill out,” says Stevens. “Embrace your new hair and, if you’re really that bothered, put a hat or a scarf on.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83a805b802ab3a9c7422858a0be518bbada70dcf/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a563689d2907a80e192d1250f7f484","title":"sam hargrave stunt performer director extraction netflix chris hemsworth","story":"The movie stuntman has directed bone-crunching thriller Extraction – and says that CGI will never replace the thrill of seeing a real person risking life and limb on screenThe stunt performers who have made it as directors can be counted on the broken fingers of one bandaged hand. In the 70s and 80s there was Hal Needham (director of Smokey and the Bandit and reportedly the inspiration for Brad Pitt’s character in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood) and Buddy Van Horn (Any Which Way You Can). But the past decade has brought a clutch of new examples: Chad Stahelski (the John Wick trilogy), David Leitch (Atomic Blonde, Deadpool 2) and now Sam Hargrave, the prodigiously bearded, 37-year-old stunt coordinator who doubled regularly for Chris Evans as Captain America.Hargrave has made his directing debut with another Avenger, Chris Hemsworth, in the Netflix thriller Extraction. Hemsworth plays the mercenary Tyler Rake, dispatched to Dhaka to rescue a crime kingpin’s kidnapped son. Though, as the boy points out, he doesn’t look like a Tyler. He seems more like a Brad.Is that a Pitt joke? “It kind of is,” admits Hargrave with a giggle down the line from his home in Malibu. “No matter how much dirt or blood you put on Chris Hemsworth, there’s no getting around it: he is devilishly handsome.”The two men go way back. “We worked out together on the first Avengers. He’s a Muay Thai practitioner and he beat the crap out of me because he’s such a big, strong dude.” It was the actor who gave Hargrave some of the soundest advice during the run-up to Extraction. “He told me, ‘Don’t forget why you got this opportunity. You direct great action, so keep that tool sharp and ready to use.’”And he has. The picture is full of action sequences staged with vigour and finesse, typically in extended unbroken takes: following Tyler and an adversary mid-fight, the camera tumbles off a roof, on to a shop’s awning and into the street, or glides in through a car’s open window as the vehicle makes its swerving, squealing getaway during a chase. The knowledge that shots have been sutured together digitally does nothing to diminish the excitement. Indeed, Hargrave was feeling justifiably pleased with himself until he got wind of Sam Mendes’s 1917, which also exploited the extended-shot illusion. “We smacked our heads when we saw that. We were like, ‘Son of a …’”He has some theories about the current popularity of the long take. “It used to be the MTV idea of quick cuts but now there’s a whole new generation who watch things shot in real time on Instagram and TikTok. There’s a videogame quality to it, a sense of ownership and involvement.” One area where Hargrave has avoided the videogame effect, however, is in the film’s violence, which is far from flippant: throats are slashed, a face shoved hard on to the teeth of a rake, a child thrown to his death from a rooftop. “There’s nothing glamorous about taking a life. It’s not that videogame idea of ‘shoot a guy, smile and move on’. It’s real action with real consequences.”Immediacy and physicality is one of the reasons he believes digital effects will never replace stunts. “That’s been a discussion for a few years now. Nothing beats knowing that the body you’re watching has been through that experience. ‘Oh man, another human being did that?’ It’s so much more impactful.” There are obvious downsides when it’s bones rather than bytes at stake: Hargrave himself is still feeling the effects from a fall on set almost a year ago. “I was trying to impress all the young stunt guys there,” he says sheepishly. “I fell really hard on my neck and shoulder, and I still can’t turn my neck right. I used to be able to get up and walk away. Now it takes a little longer to get out of bed the next day.”Between stunt performers there is, he says, a healthy sense of one-upmanship. “Most of us are type-A males with egos the size of Texas. It elevates your game when you see what someone else comes up with.” Watching John Wick was a case in point. “It’s even become a verb: to John Wick someone. Which means to beat them up in a really cool way.” The dynamic between actors and their doubles, though, tends to be one of quiet mutual respect, not unlike Leonardo DiCaprio and Pitt’s characters in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. “I’ve seen relationships like that. Chris and his regular double, Bobby Holland Hanton, have a very tight personal friendship. Actors know the stunt performers have spent their life training, just as the actors have worked on the emotional depth.”The bravest performer he’s worked with, he tells me, was Charlize Theron on Atomic Blonde. “Some of the stuff she did, her grit and determination, was incredible.” And the wussiest? “I’m gonna have to plead the fifth on that,” he laughs. There I was thinking he was brave. “Oooh, burn! In that case, I’ll nominate myself. I’m the wussiest.”• Extraction is on Netflix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e02834a48bf272110f6e7db45a9b3eff5f582a48/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03060aa59b8db650656975f3523f09a4","title":"tell us about your ultimate holiday food recipe","story":"We want to know the recipe you use to recreate the experience of food, freedom and funWith holidays on hold for the foreseeable and cooking a rare lockdown joy, your culinary repertoire can be easily expanded by recalling dishes that bring back memories of happier times on trips away.

Here’s how to make some quick, surprising and simple mealsIn this time of struggle and strife, the tin has come into its own. It is a humble creature not often at the forefront of anyone’s mind, but in reality the tin (and its jar, packet and pouch cousins) are often the backbone of what we cook and eat. The store cupboard provides a springboard from which you can be creative and spontaneous.Tinned foods are delicious, nutritious and inexpensive (not to mention extremely long-lasting). Their existence is a blessing that means you can eat juicy figs and de-choked artichokes all year-round, guilt and air-mile free.The following 10 tins are just a drop in the ocean of options. There has never been a better opportunity to try things that perhaps you have previously turned your nose up at or neglected at the back of your crammed cupboard. Heat a splash of olive oil in a large frying pan. Once warm, add one chopped garlic clove and fry until starting to colour. Add a pinch of chilli flakes and paprika and cook for a further 30 seconds. Tip in a 400g tin of tomatoes, 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp brown sugar, 2 tsp cider (or similar) vinegar and a drained 400g tin of cannellini beans. Season, then simmer over a medium-high heat for 15-20 minutes. Serve piled high on toast topped with a crispy fried egg or a blanket of cheddar.Mix together a drained 400g tin of green lentils, 70g plain flour, one egg, 3 tbsp chopped chives (or another soft herb), 1 tsp caraway seeds, 1½ tsp paprika, a finely chopped garlic clove and 200g coarsely grated beetroot (or carrot or parsnip). Season. Warm 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan. For each fritter, dollop into the pan a heaped tbsp of the mixture, flatten slightly and fry for about four minutes on each side until golden. Meanwhile, mix 1 tsp harissa into 2 tbsp yogurt. Serve the fritters with a generous spoonful of harissa yogurt.In a large saucepan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil over a low heat. Sweat 2 finely chopped onions gently, with a pinch of salt until very soft (30 to 40 minutes). Add two sliced garlic cloves, two bay leaves, 1½ tsp dried mint and 1 tsp turmeric cook for a few minutes until the garlic has softened. Tip in drained 400g tins of butterbeans, lentils and chickpeas along with 500ml vegetable stock. Bring to the boil, then turn down and cook for 20-25 minutes. Add 200g of spinach and allow to wilt. Season and ladle into bowls, drizzling over a little more olive oil.Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large frying pan. Add one finely chopped onion and cook gently for 10 minutes. Add two finely chopped garlic cloves, one bay leaf, 2 tsp smoky chilli flakes, a pinch of cinnamon, ½ tsp cumin and two carrots, cut into rounds, then cook for 2-3 minutes. Tip in two 400g tins of black beans (including the liquid) and 300ml of vegetable stock. Bring to a boil and simmer for 20-25 minutes until it has thickened. Season, pile into bowls and serve with rice, a dollop of soured cream and, if you have it, some fresh coriander.In a large frying pan, heat 2 tbsp olive oil, add two finely chopped onions and soften gently for 10-15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another frying pan, heat 4 tbsp oil, add two aubergines, cut into chunks, with a pinch of salt, fry on high for 5-10 minutes, stirring often, until the aubergine is golden. Remove from heat. The onions should now be soft add to them two finely chopped garlic cloves, ½ tsp fennel seeds, two bay leaves and a pinch of chilli flakes. Fry for 2-3 minutes, then add 200ml red wine. Bring to the boil and reduce by two-thirds. Finally, add two 400g drained tins of beluga (or similar) lentils, two 400g tins of tomatoes and the browned aubergine. Season, reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Serve this ragu with soft polenta, pasta or a hunk of bread.To make a quick chutney, put 50g fresh coriander, 20g mint, one garlic clove, the juice of half a lemon, 40g desiccated coconut and one roughly chopped chilli into a blender with 2-3 tbsp of water. Blitz until smooth, set aside and season. Roughly blitz a drained 198g tin of sweetcorn and add to a bowl add a non-blitzed, drained tin, two eggs, 100g self-raising flour, 2 tsp mild curry powder and one finely chopped red onion, then season. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large frying pan dollop in heaped tbsps of the mixture, flattening each slightly. Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden. Serve the cakes with the chutney and a lemon wedge.You will need three 125g tins of mackerel. Heat 2 tbsp of the oil from one of the tins in a saucepan over a high heat. Add 1 tsp mustard seeds. When they pop, add 1 tsp fenugreek seeds and three cardamom pods. Fry briefly, then reduce the heat and add one finely sliced onion plus a pinch of salt. Sweat for 10-15 minutes until soft. Add 1 tbsp grated ginger, five crushed garlic cloves, one chopped chilli (or equivalent) and 20 curry leaves fry for 1-2 minutes. Add two 400g tins of tomatoes and season. Simmer for 15 minutes then add the mackerel, taking care to keep the pieces whole. Reduce the heat and warm the mackerel through. Just before serving, stir in 100ml of coconut milk.Heat the oven to 200C180C fan400Fgas mark 6. Melt 50g of butter with seven tinned anchovies in a frying pan over a low heat, add one finely chopped onion and three bay leaves cook gently for 20-25 minutes until the onion is soft. Meanwhile, boil 350g tube-shaped pasta in salted water until tender. Drain and rinse under cold water. Once the onion is soft, stir in 50g plain flour, cooking for two minutes. Add 650ml milk, a little at a time, stirring until combined before adding more. Cook, stirring, until the sauce has thickened a little. Remove from the heat and melt in 230g grated cheddar. Mix an extra 100g grated cheese with 75g breadcrumbs. Tip the pasta into an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm), mix in the sauce then top with the breadcrumb mixture and a sliced tomato. Bake for 25-35 minutes until golden and bubbling vigorously.In a large frying pan, heat 1 tbsp sunflower oil over a medium heat. Once hot, add 200g green beans, cut into short pieces. Fry for 3-4 minutes until starting to colour, then add four finely chopped garlic cloves, 200g cooked rice, 1 tsp chilli oil, 2 tbsp soy sauce and the sliced whites of a bunch of spring onions. Fry, stirring often, until the rice has heated through. Push the rice to one side of the pan and pour two beaten eggs into the space. Leave the eggs to begin to set, then pull the sides into the middle, ensuring all the egg comes into contact with the pan. Once it is all cooked, break it into pieces and stir into the rice. Turn off the heat and stir through two 170g drained tins of crab and 2 tsp sesame oil. Pile into bowls and top with sliced spring onion greens and extra chilli oil.Heat the oven to 170C150C fan375Fgas mark 5. In a 1.5-litre baking dish mix three 411g tins of drained and quartered pears, a 290g tin of prunes in juice, six finely chopped stem ginger pieces, the juice of one lemon and 50g soft brown sugar. Bake for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, in a bowl, rub 125g salted butter into 250g self-raising flour until it resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in 50g more sugar and 50g roughly chopped almonds (or similar). Add 2-3 tbsp cold water and using your hands bring together into a dough. Remove the fruit from the oven. Roll the dough into small balls and sit them on top of the fruit, leaving space in between. Return to the oven for 25-30 minutes until the topping is golden and puffed up and the fruit is bubbling.Take One Tin by Lola Milne is published by Kyle Books.

The 58-year-old was unable to lead them out of the relegation zone, but the team were reprieved when the season was scrapped because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Dutch FA (KNVB) did not enforce any relegation or promotion, meaning Den Haag will stay in the top tier, but Pardew’s contract has not been renewed. His assistants, Chris Powell and Paul Butler, will also leave the club.“I have positive feelings for this club and I have enjoyed the passion of the fans,” he added. “I look back on a beautiful adventure in the Netherlands. It is a pity that the partnership ends, but I wish Den Haag every success in the future.”The former Charlton, Derby and Southend manager Powell said: “I look back on a wonderful experience at a great club. I got to work with fantastic people in a beautiful city. I want to thank the fans, the staff members and the players for their support.“I will remember my time in Den Haag forever,” the 50-year-old added. “Of course, that also applies to the beautiful banner that the supporters had made for us. Come on Den Haag.”Pardew departs after eight games in charge, winning just one – his first, against RKC Waalwijk. The team picked up three draws and four defeats in their next seven games, and were destined for the relegation play-offs before the season was halted.The former Crystal Palace and Newcastle manager had been due a bonus after the club escaped relegation, but insisted he would not accept it.“If I was formally entitled to an amount I would never want to receive it,” Pardew said on Sunday. “In this difficult period I would always return any bonus to the club, which will certainly find a good destination for it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df7fee0d95d3b894d6a22056b5e953cbc7351182/0_0_3738_2244/master/3738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed8d1c89096767e7d46be250f57cb406","title":"khashoggi fiancee stop saudi takeover of newcastle or be complicit","story":"Hatice Cengiz tells Premier League the proposed deal is incompatible with its charter The fiancee of Jamal Khashoggi has called on the Premier League to stop the acquisition of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia, saying that completion of the deal would tarnish English football and make it complicit in the “cover-up” of the journalist’s murder by the kingdom.In a letter sent by her solicitors, Hatice Cengiz also challenged whether the £300m takeover of a majority stake in Newcastle by Saudi’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is controlled by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was compatible with the Premier League’s charter. The charter prohibits a club from being controlled by an inidual who has engaged in conduct that would be “an offence” if it had occurred in the UK.Cengiz’s lawyer, Rodney Dixon QC, said: “The proposed acquisition is not just ‘business’ for the crown prince and the Saudi authorities, but an attempt to evade justice and international scrutiny for an unconscionable act. It would emasculate the Premier League’s core principles and rules, and ruin its good reputation and character, to allow the crown prince and the Saudi authorities to use this acquisition to seek to repair their international standing.”The Premier League declined a request for comment.Khashoggi, a US-based journalist for the Washington Post, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Khashoggi had entered the consulate to retrieve documents he needed to marry Cengiz, who has emerged as a strong voice in support of justice after his murder.An investigation by Agnès Callamard, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, found that Saudi Arabia was responsible under human rights law for the murder of Khashoggi and that it was “inconceivable” the operation that resulted in his death could not have been implemented without the crown prince being aware a criminal mission was being launched against the journalist.In the letter to the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, Dixon said there were “no limits” to the exploits of Bin Salman and his government. He cited a  report that revealed UK authorities had been warned by intelligence agencies that Saudi Arabia planned to target and surveil Cengiz in London months after the murder of Khashoggi.“I trust the Premier League and British authorities value their own principles and reputation above this transparent attempt at sports-washing,” she added.The British government has indicated it would not intervene in the controversial deal and, when asked about the matter recently, emphasised the UK’s close relationship with the kingdom.Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, was questioned on the issue by the SNP MP John Nicolson during a meeting of the digital, culture, media and sport committee and said it was a “matter for the Premier League” rather than Downing Street.Amnesty International has warned the Premier League it “risks becoming a patsy” if it does not consider Saudi Arabia’s human rights record before approving the takeover.Do you have a tip on this story?

He wanted to deliver some unfortunate news to four players who were out of contract in the summer and tell us that we wouldn’t be offered renewals at Colchester.Due to the circumstances we’re living in right now, he told us that the chairman, Robbie Cowling, couldn’t promise to fulfil our contracts and that is just the way it is. The chairman then called us a couple of days later just to confirm the news and to thank us for our time at the club. He said: “You never know what might happen in the future but I just can’t promise you I will be able to afford the contract I wanted to offer you.”I’m not sure what I had been expecting. I had been offered a couple of deals before the end of the season and we had agreed to continue the conversation when it was over so we could just focus on football. We were sixth in the table when everything stopped and our goal was obviously promotion this year. Then we were going to sit down again to agree something to extend my time at the club.It was a shock because for a few weeks all that had been on my mind was wondering when we were going to start playing again and complete the season. To get that phone call was obviously a bit of a shocker but at the same time I understand the business of football.It’s still frustrating because I felt like I had finally caught a break somewhere. I haven’t stayed at the same club for a third season since I was at Chelsea as a teenager but I wanted to stay in Colchester. I’ve settled down, the manager has remained the same since I got here so I have been playing every week and enjoying my football. I’m also based down south and closer to London again so everything was going well until coronavirus came along and shut everything down.I’ve dealt with situations like this before, although obviously nothing as severe. But in terms of moving clubs and starting again, I’ve had plenty of practice and will be ready for whatever comes next. The big issue is for my family because it means we will have to move again – they rely on me and always have to adjust to wherever we have to move to. We have been trying to get my oldest daughter into the school that we wanted but now we are going to have to make new plans for her to go somewhere else. Imagine trying to move house at short notice in the next few weeks with everything that is going on at the moment?That was part of the reason I really wanted to stay – people don’t realise some of the decisions you have to make when you are being offered a new contract. It’s not the same as before we had kids and could just stay in a hotel for a month. My partner is probably going to have to go up north with her family while I find my feet somewhere.We’re going to get paid until our contracts expire at the end of June and I assume that if football returns before then we will be able to play for Colchester again. But the situation still hasn’t been clarified. And what happens if they can’t finish the season until the end of July? It might be a case when we can only play five games in June and there are another four games left to play plus the play-offs, so the boys who have been released can’t play.We’ve lost our captain, a right-back, midfielder and an attacker who have all played regularly this season so that is almost half our team. It would be frustrating if we aren’t able to complete it, especially because some of us now don’t have a club to go to next season and need to be able to showcase our talents to get a move elsewhere.I’m not sure how they can resolve it – just deciding the table on a points-per-game ratio and then having play-offs means that any teams who could have made a late charge don’t have any chance. I remember Tranmere last year weren’t anywhere near the play-offs with 10 games to go and they ended up being promoted. But there are so many risks in trying to play the matches behind closed doors that I’m not sure if it’s a good idea or not.The chairman gave us a bit of extra time to try and sort ourselves out but I don’t have anything lined up at this stage. I’m just waiting for news, although the problem is that every other club is still in limbo as well. They don’t know what is happening with the players they already have or what the budget is going to look like so we just have to wait and see. It just shows how fragile life as a professional can be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fd3fc0ed1caf6c831b8cfec5a4576f3859ea687/105_448_1702_1021/master/1702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=036d9d19542b13815db24ecfe07c1639","title":"who is the shortest goalkeeper to play in the english top flight knowledge","story":"Plus: club shirts inspired by countries, more defunct kit sponsors and football’s unholy trinity“Who is the shortest goalkeeper to play in either the old First Division or the Premier League? My guess it was Laurie Sivell who kept goal for Ipswich Town in the 70s,” writes Mitch Mitchell.Peter Tomlin gets out the tape measure. “Laurie Sivell is 5ft 8in tall (1.73m). There are three goalkeepers who have played in the top ision in England that are officially recorded as being shorter than him. Ted Burgin was 5ft 7in (1.70m) and Burgin played three seasons in the top ision for Sheffield United in the 1950s and won two caps for England B. He was also in the England squad for the 1954 World Cup although he didn’t play. Steve Death was 5ft 7in (1.70m). He played one top-flight game for West Ham v Manchester City in 1969. He is more famous as a Reading player in the lower isions where he had a very successful career. He also held the record for the most minutes without conceding a goal (1,074) until 2009.“Teddy Davison, at 5ft 7in (1.70m), is the shortest goalkeeper to have played for England (one cap v Wales in 1922). He was first choice for Sheffield Wednesday for 12 seasons either side of the first world war and is recorded as saving 24 penalties of 77 in his career. He later managed Sheffield United.” Richard Worrall points out that Les Green, of Brian Clough’s Derby County team from 1968 to 1971, was 5ft 8in, the same as Sivell.Fast forward to the Premier League era and Matthew Healey has a couple of contenders, having made the point that “it’s a matter of scientific record that (particularly) men lie about their height generally. And the effect is likely to be magnified where there’s a professional imperative to exaggerate, so there is dearth of accurate information.“I’m confident-ish that the shortest goalkeeper (at least by their declared height) to play during the Premier League era is Clive Baker, who stood at 5ft 9in and was Ipswich’s first choice for a few seasons in the 90s. I vaguely remember him being a keen sweeper-up and a good reaction keeper – both useful attributes if you can’t touch the crossbar.”Matthew starts flying without wings at this point. “If you’re willing to count unused subs, however, there may be a better contender. A 16-year-old called Nicky Byrne sat on the bench for Leeds for a game at Southampton in around 1995 (I’ve not been able to pin down the exact fixture, but you can read his own comments on the experience.) Some internet sources list him as being 5ft 8in or 5ft 8.5in though typically he himself claims to be a bit bigger. He was released by Leeds at the end of 1997 but popped back up again in Westlife a few years later.”“Wolves’ Europa League shirt is inspired by the traditional Mexican national team jersey, associated with record signing Raúl Jiménez,” writes Miles Johnson. “Are there any other instances where a club has released a kit to honour a national team or nation itself?”Robin Tucker suggests Barnsley channeling their inner samba spirit. “I remember when Danny Wilson was manager of Barnsley, their fans would sing ‘It’s just like watching Brazil’.” The chant began during the Tykes’ promotion campaign under Wilson in 1996-97, and still gets an airing every now and then. As Robin points out, this inspired club kit suppliers Admiral to produce a yellow-and-green away kit for the 2001-02 season. They picked a bad year Barnsley won two away games all season, and were relegated from the second tier.Birmingham City’s jazzy 1992-93 effort incorporated the colours of the Indian flag on the club badge and socks, reports Spencer Clark. The club were owned by British Asian businessman Samesh Kumar, until “his company then went bust and the kit was replaced by the new owners, David Gold and Sullivan.”Leeds United’s 2017-18 “#allblack” away kit was modelled by our star Kiwi striker, Chris Wood, and quite strongly resembles the All Blacks rugby shirt,” notes Nat Dufton. I don’t know if it was designed to make him stay, but he left for Burnley after one appearance in the kit.”“Fulham’s bright orange away kit in the 2012-13 season was a tribute to the Netherlands national team, rolled out with the tagline ‘Orange is the new black’ (in Dutch),” writes Alex Ross. “Our manager, Martin Jol, had won three caps in the early 80s. Sadly, it did not free us from the prison of mid-table mediocrity and Jol was sacked the following season.”Finally, Pablo Miguez brings us bang up to date: “São Paulo’s current third shirt is sky blue, a tribute to the many Uruguayans who have starred for the club.”“Who are the most successful shirt sponsors, in terms of honours won?” asks Simon Bradley.Tom Aldous nominates car manufactures Opel, who he reckons have adorned the shirts of 45 trophy-winning teams:“We were wondering if anyone had ever committed the unholy trinity of missing a penalty, scoring an own goal and being sent off in the same match?” wrote Richard and Andrew in May 2012.“Not exactly that, but something very close to that, was achieved by Kenneth Omeruo, playing at ADO Den Haag in the Ereisie (on loan from Chelsea) on 28 April,” noted Stephan Wijnen. “In the game against VVV Venlo in the first half he first scored a goal, a few minutes later he scored an own goal, and in the second half he received his second yellow card and was sent off. VVV went on to win 2-1.”“In 1980, a policeman interrupted the Colchester v Millwall match and cautioned Millwall’s Mel Blyth for using strong language and potentially inciting the crowd,” writes Jason Jandu. “Are there any other cases of the police taking similar intervention during a match?”“In my isolation boredom I’ve been sorting through my old football shirts and packing and labelling them by season (sad but true), begins Michael Pilcher. “On my research I noticed that Gillingham – who usually play in blue – wore a red centenary home shirt in 2012-13, which they then recycled as their away shirt in 2013-14 when they went back to their traditional blue for home games. Are there many other examples of clubs wearing a shirt for home games that was then subsequently used as their official away shirt another season?”• Send your questions and answers to knowledge@the or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07a29d1744be0f8dc44f28082f501face8512105/0_0_3237_1942/master/3237.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4119a7b425a644ea9320ab2a8a7a122","title":"coronavirus could undo 30 years of uks international development work","story":"Impact of pandemic could be felt by world’s poorest for years to come, international development secretary tells MPsThe coronavirus pandemic threatens to undo 30 years of international development work, with a bleak picture for the world’s poorest, the international development secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, told MPs.Giving evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into the effectiveness of UK aid, Trevelyan said her biggest fear was that the secondary impact of the health crisis would be felt by the world’s poorest for years to come.“We have before us a health crisis, a humanitarian crisis and an economic crisis which threaten to undo 30 years of international development work,” she said. “The devastating impacts are already being seen both at home and abroad. My personal profoundest concern is that the secondary impacts will be felt for years to come for the poorest, most disproportionately affected.”“The reality is that no one if safe until we are all safe. So finding treatments and a vaccine will be critical to allow the world’s economic activity to go back to some sort of new normal.”Trevelyan told MPs she was really proud that the UK was at the forefront of the global response and had been repurposing aid and expertise to work on solutions in the UK and across the world.The UK is a leading donor to coronavirus research for testing and developing a vaccine, and has pledged £744m towards the international response to developing countries in the Covid-19 crisis.Trevelyan said: “The reality is that the humanitarian picture is bleak right now. The threat of famines, exacerbated by the worst locust plague for 70 years, weak healthcare system allowing the spread of the disease and economic disruptions hitting the world’s poorest and threatening a global recession and a much longer and harder road back to recovery.”Last week, the head of the UN’s food agency warned of widespread famine “of biblical proportions” because of the coronavirus pandemic.Members of the international development committee, in its first virtual evidence session, asked Trevelyan about the plans to merge the Department for International Development (DfID) with the FCO Foreign Office (FCO) and whether poverty reduction would remain a priority.Last month, Boris Johnson was accused by Labour and charities of taking British aid policy backwards by linking aid to the UK’s trade goals and insisting DfID missions in other countries report to FCO ambassadors.Trevelyan was asked if the new reporting arrangements were intended to be a merged “by the back door”, she said: “No, I wouldn’t agree with that statement. That isn’t what it is.”Asked whether poverty reduction would remain a priority, in a refreshed DfID strategy, she said it would be.Nick Dyer, acting permanent secretary for DfID, told the committee that Covid-19 was a perfect example of how the new joint ministerial arrangements made sense, because it brought diplomatic and development levers together.The committee, chaired by MP Sarah Champion, also asked Trevelyan whether the government was considering its own definition of overseas development assistance (ODA).The secretary of state replied that she believed the ODA rules are “sensible, really broad and countries are using them in different ways”.Earlier, James Cleverly, joint FCODfID minister of state for the Middle East and North Africa, told MPs that the “UK does not have tied aid”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c49e11e2e495a251dc0194c9354816a7aa9d2308/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=135a5194c0634fdc48338579ebf804ff","title":"polio campaign in africa put on hold during coronavirus","story":"WHO official warns of fresh outbreaks as jabs for 12 million children are delayedVaccinations for up to 12 million children to prevent the spread of polio in Africa will be delayed, in a major redeployment of polio eradication resources to fight the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Polio prevention campaigns, which are vital to avert outbreaks, will be suspended until at least the second half of 2020, said Dr Pascal Mkanda, the head of polio for World Health Organization Africa. The decision will inevitably lead to a rise in polio cases.“We took the difficult decision to suspend these plans and considered it would have a significant impact on preventing the spread of new outbreaks,” he said. “New outbreaks of polio will appear because we will not be able to administer the vaccines in time.”The move is the “right decision”, Mkanda said, “because we need to tackle Covid-19 and because the process of administering vaccinations can actually increase the spread of the virus”.The effect of the lack of vaccinations has already begun to emerge. On Saturday, Niger reported two new polio cases, affecting children in the capital, Niamey, and the Tillabéri region, according to the WHO. The cases are the first in the west African country since an outbreak which lasted two years was eradicated last December.“Niger stopped the previous polio outbreaks by mounting high-quality mass vaccination campaigns,” Mkanda said.The country is one of 15 in Africa experiencing “vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks”, with cases spreading among parts of the populations yet to receive a vaccination.The increase and success of preventive vaccination campaigns around the world – particularly in Africa and Asia, where the disease has been a scourge – had given international health authorities hope that polio could be eradicated. Yet the Covid-19 pandemic has significantly set back efforts.Administering the oral polio vaccines would put patients at risk of contaminating Covid-19, the WHO said.The World Health Organization (WHO) was founded on the 7 April 1948, a date celebrated annually as World Health Day. As an agency of the United Nations, the organisation has developed into an international establishment which involves 150 countries and employs 7,000 people. WHO is responsible for the World Health Report and the World Health Survey. Since its establishment it has played a fundamental role in the eradication of smallpox, and currently prioritises diseases including HIVAIDs, Ebola, Malaria and Tuberculosis.\u0026nbspWHO takes a global responsibility for the co-ordinated management and handling of outbreaks of new and dangerous health threats - like the Covid-19 coronavirus.The current WHO director general is Dr Tedros Adhamon Ghebreyesus, elected for a five year term in 2017. Prior to his election, Dr Tedros served as Ethiopia’s minister for foreign affairs. He also served as minister of Health for Ethiopia from 2005-2012 where he led extensive reform to the country’s health system.WHO\u0027s handling of the global pandemic has been criticised by US president Donald Trump, who announced in April that the US will no longer contribute to funding the agency.WHO teams focused on testing, contact tracing and social awareness to prevent polio have been entirely redeployed to help with coronavirus.“What we are doing now on polio is to work very hard on preparedness and planning to be able to do more effective campaigns and really jump in as soon as the Covid-19 response activities have been stopped,” Mkanda added.The total number of Covid-19 infections in Africa is rapidly increasing – more than doubling in the last two weeks to 32,000 – with a similar increase in the number of deaths, to 1,400.Concerns that an outbreak could pose profound challenges to their health systems led many African governments to adopt early and aggressive measures to contain it.WHO officials on polio as well as other related health campaigns have been pooled to support health agencies across Africa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b3b3e684657776e36598e47f9199a2aaac313ea/0_262_3930_2359/master/3930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f909e4464b70e8945f0c8ead28b155aa","title":"covid 19 spread south america","story":"From his temporary home in Rio de Janeiro, the ’s Latin America correspondent, Tom Phillips, can hear the nightly protests against Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, where cases are steadily rising.

From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.Even computer gaming is stepping increasingly back into the past. Two of the biggest launches in recent years have actually been mini versions of the comparatively ancient 80s and 90s games consoles, Sega’s Mega Drive and Nintendo’s SNESNES. “Without a doubt, people are going back to the classics,” says Iain Simons, director of the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield. “They pioneered so many of the things we have today.”One obvious reason why audiences are opting for classic, safe bets is the sense of comfort they can provide in a world that feels increasingly precarious. This feeling of comfort isn’t simply a function of nostalgic familiarity, however. Today’s new TV shows often reflect our current dystopian mood and the fashion for grisly narrative plot twists and traumatic backstories. Think Black Mirror compared with Frasier.There are other reasons for playing it safe when it comes to pop culture. Partly, it can be about taking joy in simplicity amid the complexity of the world we live in. Our frantic pace of life makes spare time so rare that people are wary of not enjoying the little they have of it. “I can see the appeal in a safe bet, especially if you are going to spend a lot of money on tickets,” says Anna Smith, film critic, broadcaster and host of the all-female film review podcast Girls on Film.Likewise, Simons notes that there’s a beauty in the relative simplicity of older video games: “There’s something comforting about only having three lives in a game there are only so many hours in the day.”Nostalgic cultural consumption can also remove the all-too common problem of too much choice. “The overabundance of content can make people feel overwhelmed,” says Cristel Russell, a professor of marketing at Graziadio Business School, who has conducted several studies into people’s re-reading of stories and reconsumption of media. “It’s like going to a restaurant and the menu being 20 pages long. You’re probably just going to order something you’ve had before.”One of Russell’s studies found that revisiting cultural favourites is such a deliberate act – as opposed to a habit – that she coined the term “volitional reconsumption” to describe it. She also found that nostalgic culture can offer something that new works can’t: a form of self-discovery. “The thing you’re watching hasn’t changed, but you have,” explains Russell. “You’ve accumulated all this knowledge and experience, so you’re not looking at it through the same eyes. When you revisit it, you get to see how much you have changed as a person.”Revisiting pieces of classic cultural entertainment can also give us bonding social experiences. For instance, events such as Secret Cinema, which screens old favourites in specially-created immersive worlds, thrive on the feeling of community and belonging you get when you bring fans of a movie together to celebrate it. “I think one of the keys here is the community aspect: we love to watch a cherished film with others, and laugh and cry together,” says Smith. “In a society that feels increasingly less community driven, in many ways this is an outlet for a positive shared experience.”There are other possible psychological benefits to reconsuming cultural works. Erica Hepper, a lecturer in personality and social psychology at the University of Surrey, has researched the social emotion of nostalgia, including the reconsumption of works of art. One study involved letting participants choose an old, beloved song to listen to and then comparing their emotions with those of people who hadn’t done so. “Time and again, we found that people who listened to something that was nostalgic experienced all of these psychological boosts – they feel more connected to people, they feel better about themselves, they feel more optimistic,” says Hepper. “They also feel more motivated to achieve their goals. So nostalgia isn’t about being stuck in the past, it actually looks to the future.”Indeed, one of Russell’s studies showed that reconsuming cultural works can even involve more intense cognitive processes than watching something for the first time. To test this, subjects were made to wear eye-tracking equipment while watching a black-and-white Russian film twice. The equipment monitored both the movement of their eyes and pupil dilation, which can indicate the intensity of the cognitive effort they were undergoing. “Sure enough, on the second viewing, your eye gaze goes to different parts of the screen – you are taking it in in a different way,” says Russell.She found that people were watching in a way that suggested they appreciated the film much more as a work of art on the second viewing. For instance, they were looking at all the creative details rather than just following the plot. Moreover, she found that people’s pupils were more dilated while doing so. “When you rewatch something, the cognitive effort involved changes. You are hyper-responsive – all of your senses are on. It is a much more intense process than watching something for the first time.”That intensity might seem counterintuitive, given how comforting nostalgic pop culture can feel. But as the trend itself illustrates, opting for comforting pop culture isn’t a passive act. Given the emotional and psychological upsides of the tried and tested, it’s no wonder we enjoy watching things again. And again. And again.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”Spurred on by the peer pressure of social media and clickbait articles about patently daft new trends, people all too often act as if they’re playing a gigantic game of chicken. When they aren’t posting smiling holiday selfies from the post-nuclear wreckage of Chernobyl, they’re braving the latest Insta grooming trends that you just have to try – even if they leave you looking like you’ve had your eyebrows rubber stamped on to your face.The 21st century seems so unhinged, it feels as though it’s drastically in need of a friend to confiscate its phone and force-feed it a sensible mug of Horlicks. So as we enter a new decade, it’s time to wake up to the obvious truth that sometimes playing it safe might be the smarter option. Sure, it won’t necessarily make for great social media content or keep trend forecasters in business, but the tried and tested route at least offers proven enjoyment.But there are things out there that are just unfailingly brilliant – melted cheese, beaten-track holidays, every Bill Murray film ever made. These are just some of the reasons that “safe” should be something we embrace. Another is the obvious fact that safety keeps you, well, safe. Just consider all the revolutionary advances in car safety technology.The safe option is one that doesn’t lead to you royally screwing up. It’s a guaranteed good time. It’s not being afraid to use your critical faculties, shun desperate fads and to do something that you genuinely know to be great. It’s suiting yourself, no matter the pressure to do the same stuff that everyone else is talking about.It isn’t always easy. But increasingly, playing it safe is the boldest thing you can do.We’re under so much pressure to be edgy these days that we often overlook safer, more rewarding options. Here are some user-friendly safety tips to help you navigate modern lifeBinge-watching TVWe might be living through an extended golden age of television, but the explosion in edgy programming has also given us an awful lot of duds. So it can be all too easy to make a habit out of wasting 12 hours of your life. Protect yourself from another bad long-term relationship with a TV show by learning when to quit. Studios like to make a big splash on their opening, so if the first episode sucks, it isn’t going to get better from there on in. But what happens when you’re, say, four episodes in? One way to develop the discipline to quickly give up is to think of your time as an economic investment. Just because you’ve invested four hours, it makes no sense to invest more if there’s no likely payoff. Economists call this the “sunk cost fallacy”. Instead, focus on the future time you’ll gain rather than on the time you’ve already sunk.The beaten trackIt’s easy to have that once-in-a-lifetime holiday: go somewhere you’ll never, ever want to visit again. Plenty of people willingly do this in the name of adventure or to prove their alpha credentials. But there is much to be said for the relaxing and restorative joy of the safe, well-trodden path – such as comfortable beds, rainproof roofs and nice food. The trick to taking your first step back to the beaten track is to refrain from judging other people for choosing the tourist trail and package holidays – then hopefully you’ll stop judging yourself.Foodie warningSocial media and TV cookery shows have conspired to make food even more of a feast for our eyes than our taste buds. But trying to assess food’s deliciousness with your eyes is like trying to appreciate music with your mouth. It’s important to take food-based Instagram posts with a pinch of (figurative) salt, as some restaurants try to capitalise on these trends by creating dishes based around how they’ll look on social media. Avoid regrets by engaging in real conversation: if you see friends posting about having eaten somewhere that looks great, get in touch to check they actually rated the taste of the meal. Just because someone shares a pretty photo, it doesn’t make it a food recommendation.Before you startup, stopThe digital revolution has fuelled such a fixation with startups that it almost feels de rigueur to quit your job and start your own venture. Alternatively, you might be tempted to devote yourself full-time to your side hustle. Before you consider whether or not to take the plunge, one question you should ask yourself is whether the thing that you’re really fetishising is the idea of being a risk-taker rather than the venture itself. So be sure to scrutinise your real motivations. For instance, are you following your passion or your ego? And bear in mind that sometimes our egos are actually fuelled by feelings of insecurity.Savvy tech is safe techEach month brings a cacophony of new digital bells and whistles and it can be easy to simply dismiss them. So how do you sift useful tech from pointless tech? One tip is to ask whether or not the new app, gadget or feature will save you time, give you pleasure or make you safer. The latter question often gets overlooked. But when it comes to developments such as smart homes and in-car technology – including driver monitoring and assistance systems – making things safer is actually the main point.Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

And these devices are already proving their worthWho hasn’t found their attention straying behind the wheel? Modern life is riddled with distractions that fight tooth and nail for our attention – whether it’s noisy children, garish adverts, tiredness, traffic cameras, personal pressures, endless to-do lists or those digital devices and social media notifications that we forgot to switch to silent. We always seem to be spreading our attention too thinly or are exhausted from having to think 10 different thoughts.This is one reason why the focus of vehicle safety design has shifted in recent years. Whereas in the past it was about applying materials and design to mitigate damage to occupants in crashes, it’s now about using the latest technology to prevent accidents happening in the first place. In short, it’s about cars that can take control when you have lost it.The shift in emphasis is often referred to as a switch from passive safety systems to active safety systems. Indeed, when it comes to cars, making things safer is one of the main drivers of tech developments. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) can aid concentration and alertness and encompass features including automated braking that relies on technologies such as radar, cameras and lasers. “ADAS has been a step change,” says Andrew Morris of Loughborough University’s Transport Safety Research Centre. “There was a consensus that human fallibility is hard to eradicate and that all passive systems can do is reduce damage. At that point, the focus shifted to prevention. New technology offers solutions in the shape of sensing and automation, which is a better philosophy because it also protects vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists.”Japanese carmaker Subaru has been at the forefront in the development of ADAS since 2013, when it introduced its “second pair of eyes”, the EyeSight system. This uses two sophisticated colour cameras mounted inside the car on the upper edge of the windshield above the rearview mirror. The system is capable of processing accurate stereo images to identify vehicles travelling in front, as well as obstacles, traffic lanes and other objects such as pedestrians.Using images generated by the cameras, EyeSight can run a suite of six ADAS:As with all the company’s core safety tech, EyeSight is continually evolving. For example, the Forester e-BOXER and Levorg now feature the EyeSight assist monitor, which provides a heads-up display of EyeSight system warnings for drivers to see more clearly.EyeSight is fitted as standard to all Subaru models, save the BRZ sports car. In 2019, the Forester e-BOXER achieved the maximum five-star Euro NCAP rating for safety and was declared “Best in Class 2019 in the Small Off-roadMPV Class”.Other Subaru safety systems include its Driver Monitoring System, which can detect the driver’s eyes closing or looking away for an extended period of time and trigger audio and visual warnings. This could be a potential lifesaver given that, according to Thatcham research centre, at least one fatal sleep-related crash occurs every day in the UK. Subaru’s Driver Monitoring System won the Technology Award at the 2020 What Car? Awards. What Car? praised the system, calling it “the most advanced of its kind”. In the tests, it proved to be more accurate at identifying when concentration was lost, compared with other manufacturer systems.Reverse Automatic Braking (RAB) and Subaru Rear Vehicle Detection also use sensors to spot potential objects behind the vehicle or in blind spots and RAB can even apply the brakes to avoid a collision.While driver distraction can be lethal, education and legislation – like the law banning handling a mobile phone – can only go so far.Full autonomy is some way off but, as of 2022, new safety technologies will become mandatory in cars and vans under EU law and are likely to be adopted in the UK – specifically lane-keeping assistance and advanced emergency braking. This will contribute to the long-term goal dubbed “Vision Zero”, of moving close to zero fatalities and serious injuries.But is eradicating all accidents possible through technology?“It’s very aspirational certainly and hard to achieve in the foreseeable future,” admits Morris. “However it’s a sound concept, a safe-system approach, which says if an accident happens for whatever reason we blame the system rather than the driver. And these systems will definitely become more effective as they are refined.”Safety mattersYour world matters to us.

Where do they go when youth clubs are shut?Beth Gee, 19, has been attending Creative Networks, a youth club in Bristol city centre, for the last three years. “It’s a place to hang out, see my friends,” she says. “I can also talk to staff if I’m feeling anxious.”Gee says that before the pandemic, she was having weekly face-to-face support at the youth club, in addition to support from her local mental health services. Now she can no longer attend the youth club, so can’t see her friends. Gee is relieved that at least her community mental health team has switched to remote counselling. She has autism, an eating disorder and anxiety issues. “I’m lucky, I’m still getting support, but it’s on the phone now and instead of getting an hour, it’s more like 20 minutes,” she says.Yet Gee feels she needs more support than ever. She works part time as a carer, looking after 10 to 15 older people in supported accommodation. But she fears getting coronavirus from or spreading it to her vulnerable clients. “Yesterday we were told of a suspected coronavirus case for someone on one of my rounds,” she says. “So now, on top of the masks and gloves, we’re having to wear face shields. It’s very worrying.”Gee is far from alone in having heightened anxiety levels during the pandemic. New research by the National Youth Agency, which works with youth organisations and young people across the UK, and the children’s commissioner, published on Wednesday, shows that there are now 3 million vulnerable young people in England who need support with family relationships, mental health, domestic abuse, or other needs. That’s 2 million more vulnerable eight to 19-year-olds needing help because of the pandemic.The figures were estimated from emerging data collated in March and April, including from helplines, sector reports and grassroots evidence, and compared with existing official data such as the numbers of children living with a vulnerable family background, figures on offending behaviour and NHS data on mental health.For many, youth clubs provide a vital lifeline, offering somewhere to go, something to do and a trusted adult to talk to. But the lockdown means youth services, already decimated after a decade of austerity, are not easily able to meet this extra need for help. Local authority youth workers have mostly been redeployed, while voluntary, sector-run youth clubs and centres have shut their doors and are providing limited services online. Most street-based youth work has ceased.The report estimates that nationally one in five youth clubs will not reopen, with a higher proportion staying shut in some regions, and calls for swift and generous action from ministers. “The government needs to provide urgent resources and funding to safeguard youth services,” says Leigh Middleton, chief executive of the National Youth Agency. “Three times the number of young people are at risk as a result of the lockdown, yet just as they need us most, the pandemic is pushing many youth organisations to the brink.”But it’s not all doom and gloom. In Leeds, for example, charity Barca, which runs youth clubs for 11 to 19-year-olds, is managing to reach many of the young people it works with digitally.Virtual club sessions through Zoom, and one-to-one online drop-in sessions with youth workers at fixed times five days a week, are both proving popular.Barca has also distributed 74 activity packs for young people and their younger siblings. “It’s great for them, but it also allows us to have face-to-face contact,” says Amanda Sykes, senior practitioner in Barca’s children, young people and family service.And last week the charity held its first socially distant doorstep dance session, run by social enterprise Dazl. “We had 50 people out in their gardens and 30 joined in,” says Sykes. For Demi, 13, who used to do activities such as football and cooking at the Fairfield Community Centre youth club in west Leeds, it made her day. “I have been really bored since school shut, but today was brilliant,” she says. Barca plans to roll out doorstep dance to other streets and start running doorstep sport sessions too.While digital support is better than no youth service at all, there are growing calls for youth centres to reopen. The NYA report calls for youth services to be designated as key work, so that youth workers can provide face-to-face support to vulnerable young people. “The risk to young people of catching coronavirus has to be balanced against the health risks of remaining in lockdown,” says Middleton.In Wales, where the Welsh government still funds statutory youth services and last year announced a new youth work strategy and a £6.2bn increase in funding in its 2020-21 budget, some youth centres have stayed open during lockdown.David Williams, who manages Torfaen borough council’s youth service, in south Wales, says that statutory youth workers are currently helping support vulnerable and at risk children in schools. And for care leavers, there is still a face-to-face service. Weekly appointments at the Ashley House Youth Centre are strictly spaced so that the building can be cleaned between visitors, a one-way system is in place to ensure social distancing and youth workers are only allowed into the building for the duration of their meeting with the young person. “It means we can ensure that they have a hot meal, that their phone is charged and clothes are cleaned,” says Williams. “But most importantly, they get to speak to a youth worker, who in many cases will be the only person they have spoken to that week.”Some youth services in England hope to open their doors in the next few weeks. Stuart Dunne, chief executive of Youth Focus NW, a charity supporting youth provision across the north-west, says that all 23 local authority youth services are operating online. “A number are planning to reopen centres quite soon,” he says, “while respecting two-metre distancing rules and limiting the number of young people who can attend at any one time.”Ultimately, the nature of youth work will have to change. “We have to make sure that after lockdown ends, services are not only put back, but developed,” says Melanie Ryan, joint chief executive of Youth Cymru, the national umbrella body for youth organisations in Wales.Ian McLaughlan, chief executive of Youth Scotland, which supports 65,000 young people, 1,300 youth groups and more than 8,000 youth workers, agrees. He estimates that in Scotland, around half the youth groups have stopped operating for now, while the rest are operating digitally. Yet the Scottish government provides core funding to national youth services and has provided an extra £350m to councils and charities, some of which will find its way to youth services. “We’re not hearing that many youth groups saying they will have to shut down completely,” he says.A spokeswoman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport says: “We are committed to doing all we can to help young people in these challenging times. This includes grants available to youth organisations from the National Lottery Community Fund, Sport England and the Arts Council, and the unprecedented Treasury coronavirus support package for workers and businesses.“Our £500m youth investment fund will also provide long-term investment in the sector and make a positive contribution to many young people’s lives.”Back in Bristol, Gee hopes that after the lockdown, there will be less loneliness, a greater sense of community, and more human interaction. “I hope people understand that being able to socialise is so important for everyone.” For now, she is counting down the days until she can go back to Creative Networks and see her friends again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17e0659ffc2a23b83cee324dbcf8565662c12033/298_311_2599_1559/master/2599.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d4bb5618d31c555191ca6436905458d","title":"comptons cricket summer 47 succour nation needs now","story":"Denis Compton and Bill Edrich became a symbol of national renewal with ‘happy, reckless and carefree’ batting that broke the grip of grim timesOn 21 January 1947, Christopher Isherwood came back to London. He had been away in the US for eight years, and now found his old city “powerfully and continuously depressing”. It wasn’t the bomb damage, shocking as that was, but the shabbiness of the place, the peeling plaster and faded paint, the tattered wallpaper at his club, and the bare walls at the National Gallery.London “remembered the past and was ashamed of its present appearance”, he wrote. Amid all the rictus grin-and-bear-it cheeriness, “several Londoners I talked to at that time believed it would never recover. ‘This is a dying city,’ one of them told me.”In modern London, life was never bleaker than it was that winter. Isherwood’s friends promised him it was worse then than it had been during the war. “The situation couldn’t by any stretch of the imagination be viewed as a challenge to self-sacrifice or an inspiration to patriotism it was merely hell.”There were soldiers in the streets melting snow drifts with flamethrowers. Gas was running at a quarter pressure, electricity was restricted and there were jail sentences if you were caught using it. Newspapers were made to cut pages, television and radio to reduce programming and all outdoor lights were turned off. People worked by candlelight, wore greatcoats indoors, slept in balaclavas. And everything was rationed – “from eggs to minute pieces of scraggy Argentine meat”, wrote Isherwood’s friend John Lehmann, “from petrol to bed linen to ‘economy’ suits”.And sport, too. That February, the government banned midweek horse and greyhound races and football matches. It was a wildly unpopular move, even with the left-wing press: “The government must give us some light in these days of austerity,” said the Daily Herald, “football and the dogs have been some of that light.” But there was no light to give. In the spring the thaw came and floods followed, three quarters of a million acres of farmland were swamped, tens of thousands of acres of wheat and potatoes spoiled, thousands of sheep and cattle drowned. Unemployment hit two million.“Are there to be no fruits of victory?” asked Lehmann. In his history of these years, Austerity Britain, David Kynaston quotes a Mass Observation interview: “Worse than the war mate ain’t it? At least you knew wot was ’appening then.”The football season was extended into June and there was talk, too, that the cricket season could be affected. In the Commons the Tory MP Gurney Braithwaite pushed Clement Attlee for an answer on whether that summer’s Test series against South Africa would go ahead.Attlee’s own cabinet papers show the Home Office had two meetings with the MCC to talk about rearranging the fixtures. In the end it was decided they would be played as scheduled. It helped that Attlee was a devoted fan – “nothing of a bowler and an uncertain bat”, according to his biographer Michael Jago, but a dedicated reader of Wisden.The decision was right. The public asked for light and that summer they got Denis Compton.Compton had been away in Australia, playing in the Ashes. England lost 3-0. “We read the dispatches of these happenings, cabled for inclusion in newspapers still emaciated by paper rationing,” Eric Midwinter wrote. “The sombre tidings arrived during dismal winter mornings, with home and streets still dark and chill. Spluttering coal fires, barely yet alight, were the lot of most in those stone-cold houses, as cricket lovers took stock of the relentlessly bad news.”Still, Compton and his England teammate Bill Edrich had wintered well. They’d had sunshine and, since rationing was more generous in Australia, an abundance of food, too.It showed. That summer Edrich and Compton broke every batting record, they made run after run after run against all-comers, Edrich made 3,539, Compton 3,816, with 18 centuries. There never was, never would be, another season like it. And the floods gave way to drought, “the summer settled into one of scorching intensity”, wrote Midwinter, “day after day of cloudless sky”.The crowds came in tens and then, by the end, hundreds of thousands. Everyone, everywhere watching Compton and Edrich, listening to Compton and Edrich, talking of Compton and Edrich. Attlee followed their progress on the new ticker-tape machine his press secretary had installed outside the Cabinet Office.It wasn’t just the weight of scoring, it was the way they scored – happy, reckless, and carefree. “The exuberance of Compton’s batting and personality became a symbol of national renewal,” wrote Wisden years later. A knot was pulled tight between the game and the public that summer, and it’s never quite slipped loose. There’s still, always will be, a latent love for it, it’s a minority pastime that’s also a national sport.“Never have I been so deeply touched on a cricket ground as I was in this heavenly summer,” Neville Cardus recalled, “when I went to Lord’s to see a pale-faced crowd, existing on rations, the rocket bombs still in the ears of most folk – to see this worn, dowdy, crowd watching Compton. The strain of long years of anxiety and affliction passed from all hearts and shoulders at the sight of Compton in full sail, sending the ball here, there, and everywhere, each stroke a flick of delight, a propulsion of happy, sane, healthy life. There were no rations in an innings by Compton.”Cricket has never mattered quite so much again as it did in those few months but still, now, the game the English turn to for succour and comfort. Soon, we will again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fba69efadbd38a2be0ab93cf711a70101ae1e7a/0_293_5368_3219/master/5368.jpg?width=5250\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bab5a8e34be4e7ab0546390d3bb62502 10500w","title":"are you planning to mark a special occasion during lockdown","story":"If you are preparing for a big life event in the next fortnight, our photographer would like to capture the moment – from a safe distance Lockdown has wreaked havoc on our social lives.

His lawyers learned on Tuesday that his Covid-19 test was positive, and in a phone call with the , Asgari had a bad cough and said he had had a fever for days.He and his family are calling for his release to a medical facility where he can receive proper care.“It makes sense to send me to the hospital as soon as possible. I don’t trust them at all,” the 59-year-old said on Tuesday amid repeated coughing fits. “If something happens, they are not fast responders … I prefer to leave this dirty place.”Asgari’s story sparked international outrage after he spoke about his fears of Covid-19 spreading inside crowded Ice facilities with substandard cleaning practices and a lack of supplies. The professor, who has a history of respiratory problems, was exonerated in a US sanctions trial last year, but Ice has refused to release him or allow him to return to Iran. Iran’s foreign minister recently called for his release, as have some US lawmakers and human rights groups.Asgari is confined to a small room at the Winn correctional center in a Louisiana, a state hard hit by coronavirus.Ice informed the attorneys that Asgari’s test was positive on Tuesday, but Asgari said Ice had not yet told him the results and that he had learned of them on a call with his family and lawyers. “The nurse … always says the test results are not in,” Asgari said, noting that the medical staff checked on him twice or three times a day.Ice told Asgari’s lawyers he would only be released to a hospital if he was struggling to breathe, the attorneys said.Bryan Cox, an Ice spokesman, said there were two confirmed Covid-19 cases at Winn but declined to answer specific questions about Asgari.The professor has repeatedly raised concerns about Ice continuing to bring in new detainees into the close quarters of the facility, mixing them with those already jailed. Asgari said he got a bad fever after Ice recently brought a new group to his pod.The specifics of Asgari’s case have been particularly shocking to immigration attorneys. Asgari, a father of three, has deep ties to the US, including two children living in America. In 2017, he was charged with fraud and trade secret theft relating to his work with a university in Ohio. But after a long trial, he was acquitted in November 2019.But because the US had revoked his original visa, he was taken into Ice custody and has remained detained. Since the pandemic hit, he has tried to “self-deport” to Iran or get approval to stay with his family in the US but has been denied. Now, even if released, he would probably be unable to get on an immediate flight due to his diagnosis.Asgari said he was unable to shower while in isolation and was given a bowl of water he could use to wash his head. He said he had also pleaded for fresh fruit, which he has not had for a month.At Winn, he and other detainees told the  last month that many of them were trying to get deported because they were so fearful of Covid-19 exposure inside. Several men said the detainees were responsible for all cleaning, and there was a single shower and only two toilets for all 44 of them to share. They are also sleeping on beds spaced roughly 2ft apart.“I can’t believe this is happening. It’s devastating,” said Mehrnoush Yazdanyar, an attorney working with Asgari’s family. “Every fear he had has been realized, one by one, with him ending up with Covid-19. This is an innocent man who hasn’t committed any crimes. He shouldn’t be behind bars. Why does the US government continue to keep him in detention?”The number of positive Covid-19 cases inside Ice jails has been steadily climbing, with Ice officials reporting that hundreds of detainees have the virus. But only a fraction of people inside immigration jails have received tests so far, and rights groups fear the rate could be much higher. Some judges have ordered Ice to release detainees due to Covid-19 risks, and advocates have urged the US to conduct immediate mass releases to avoid a huge death toll inside.As of 18 April, Ice had 30,737 people in custody, and the population in jails has declined by roughly 8,000 since 29 February, according to the Ice spokesman.Cox said Ice had adequate cleaning supplies, adding in an email that the agency had “a long history of handling communicable diseases in the course of everyday operations” and had “taken extensive precautions to limit the potential spread of COVID-19”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa11e37810738021728f883171386ae8a5608f47/0_285_4099_2460/master/4099.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9ee9546aedc418a38801d66dd0510efe","title":"justin trudeau canada french language pandemic","story":"French has become a collateral victim of the coronavirus pandemic in Canada, forcing the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to defend failures to uphold laws requiring labels and services in both official languages.Canada is officially bilingual, but the government has allowed the sale of imported disinfectants labelled only in English because of “the extreme situation in which we find ourselves”, Trudeau said on Tuesday.“In certain situations, we are ready to allow unilingual signage and labelling,” he said.“But we would certainly prefer that this not happen because our linguistic duality is not just a question of our Canadian identity, it’s also a question of safety for consumers.”The move has outraged representatives of Canada’s francophone minority, who called it “dangerous” and “disrespectful” to those who had fought hard over the centuries to preserve their mother tongue.According to the latest census, almost one-quarter of Canada’s 37 million people speak French on a daily basis.“Nothing justifies the lack of respect for our two official languages. It is a health and safety issue,” said Senator René Cormier.Canada’s language commissioner, Raymond Théberge, has also lamented a lack of public French-language health announcements in New Brunswick and Ontario provinces, which have large French-speaking communities.French speakers, he said, must be able to understand messages sent by government institutions, especially during the current pandemic, which has killed about 3,000 Canadians.Trudeau said not all companies that have converted manufacturing to make medical equipment or hand sanitizers, for example, have either bilingual staff or the capabilities “to make that happen”.Similarly, Canada has had to turn to new sources of imports for key supplies, which may not conform to labelling rules."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad9c10c7c0eeea9f1a601249c3583ce77ac22a4/2470_21_2530_1518/master/2530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c20d1de86e6637cccc867a157ea45989","title":"quiz how much do you know about the coronavirus","story":"You’ve been bombarded with information about the coronavirus for weeks - how much have you taken in?It has dominated global headlines for weeks, and you could be forgiven for feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information you’ve seen, heard and read about the coronavirus outbreak.

Here are just some of the areas where the government is under pressure to provide detailed answers – or risk being accused of a whitewash.There are huge questions about the secrecy surrounding the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), the crucial body advising Boris Johnson on the UK’s coronavirus response. MPs, academics and medical professionals want a detailed list of who sits on it, their disciplines, minutes of its twice weekly meetings and, most importantly, more documents showing the basis on which they are making decisions about the lockdown.Five weeks ago, the government published a tranche of scientific papers showing the possible effects of the virus and social distancing measures. But nothing more has been forthcoming on the impact of the lockdown. ’s publication last week of a list of many attendees, including the prime minister’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings, fuelled calls for transparency. Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, has now promised that a membership list of participants would be published with their permission and the government also says it is planning to release more scientific papers in the coming days.Politicians from Tory grandees to opposition leaders are growing impatient with the government’s refusal to set out an exit strategy. In particular, they have been pressing for information on the economic impact of the measures so far, what this means for wider public health, rising domestic abuse, child abuse, children’s educational outcomes and other potential negative consequences.There was hope that the prime minister’s return to Downing Street might mean a roadmap out of the lockdown is published this week, but No 10 suggests this is unlikely to happen until just before the review date of 7 May. Many ideas have been floated in the press on opening the economy – from friends and family bubbles and socially distanced schools to which sectors may be allowed to return to work first.However, No 10 is remaining officially tight-lipped about the options, insisting that the public supports a lockdown until the spread is suppressed and the risk of a second peak is reduced. Boris Johnson may, however, release some information about the current status of the spread of the virus and how much further the UK has to go before easing restrictions after a cabinet meeting on Thursday.It is still unclear how many people are dying of coronavirus, the exact age profile and the locations of hotspots. The main criticism is that the daily death toll from coronavirus published by the Department of Health and Social Care only includes hospital deaths and wide age brackets, after a 29-hour time lag.The Office for National Statistics is now regularly releasing details for overall excess mortality with a few days’ time lag, which gives a wider picture of deaths in the community, both directly and indirectly related to the coronavirus crisis. However, there are still no real-time figures for deaths in specific settings from confirmed or likely coronavirus, such as care homes and households. This is set to change, after Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said daily deaths in care homes and the community would be published each day from Wednesday.There is also an incomplete picture of infection numbers because of the patchy situation with testing, with no widespread community monitoring. Some reports suggest there are still 350,000 infected people in the community but that is not an officially published figure.Ministers have been repeating huge figures for distribution of PPE, saying a billion pieces have been sent out since the crisis began across tens of thousands of sites. But the BBC’s Panorama accused the government of fiddling the numbers by counting each glove as an item, rather than pairs of gloves, and including paper towels and cleaning equipment, which are not protective clothing.Furthermore, No 10 has not come up with “burn rate” figures –how much PPE is needed and being used each day – so the huge numbers for items distributed have no context. Labour has repeatedly pointed to the “mismatch” between ministers claiming there are no shortages and the situation on the ground, where medics complain of having to manufacture makeshift protection, reuse items or go without.Ministers have been providing daily figures for testing capacity, actual tests, and people on whom tests have been performed. But they have failed to breakdown the types of people tested, including how many patients, care residents, hospital workers, care workers and other key workers are being tested and where in the country. Critics have asked for more information on why the number of tests being carried out do not match the capacity for testing, with many people unable or unwilling to travel for miles when unwell to drive-through testing centres.There is also ambiguity around the millions of antibody tests bought by the government, with a lack of clarity about how many different types are being tested, how much they cost, where they come from and how accurate they have proved so far. Ministers have been considering ordering a large batch from British developers of a test but there have been conflicting reports about whether they are reliable enough for home use.On Tuesday, Hancock announced a huge expansion of the eligibility criteria for coronavirus testing, with over-65s and those who work outside the home now able to get tested for coronavirus as long as they have symptoms. Moreover, tests will be available even without symptoms for all NHS staff, hospital patients, care home workers and their elderly residents. The now-notorious Exercise Cygnus was a pandemic preparation project carried out four years ago, which showed the the UK was woefully underprepared for a global outbreak of a new virus. Whistleblowers revealed a huge number of shortcomings were identified including low stockpiles of PPE, not enough ventilators, and inadequate hospital capacity. However, ministers are refusing to declassify and publish the report, with Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, claiming on Sunday that he could not remember whether he had seen it or not. Hancock insisted on Tuesday that he had received assurances from officials that “everything appropriate to do was done” following the report’s recommendations but there is still no commitment to see it published.The cabinet received advice last week from its scientists on Sage about whether it is effective for people to wear face masks to stop the spread of coronavirus but it is refusing to share the information or make recommendations as a result of the advice. The Scottish government advised on Tuesday that people should wear face masks in shops and on public transport. Questions are being asked about why No 10 is refusing to come to a decision when every day could be crucial in terms of stopping the further spread of the virus."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c464bb69d009f4dc144f449f5d1b8074b8b9d37/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2618ac23bf0c6ccbdef2b38e2a11855","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:According to the Johns Hopkins researchers, at least 3,116,680 people have been infected worldwide and at least 217,168 have died since the outbreak began. The numbers are likely to be significant underestimates due to suspected underreporting and differing testing and recording systems around the world. US cases account for roughly a third of the known global total, at over 1 million.China’s parliament is set to hold its annual meeting on 22 May, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday, more than two months later than originally planned. China’s top political consultative body, the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, has also proposed to start its annual session on 21 May. It’s not clear yet how long the meetings will last. They traditionally see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days.The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has defied China and defended the “entirely reasonable and sensible” call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19, as the international political fallout over the pandemic deepened. While Australia has eschewed the more strident approach of the US, which has stopped funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it has urged its allies to back an overhaul of the WHO and suggested recruiting independent investigators akin to “weapons inspectors” to determine the source of major disease outbreaks.Three US children infected with the coronavirus are being treated for a rare inflammatory syndrome that appears similar to one that has raised concerns by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain, Reuters reports. Italian and British medical experts are investigating a possible link between the coronavirus pandemic and clusters of Kawasaki disease, a severe inflammatory disease among infants arriving in hospitals with high fevers and swollen arteries.Sixty-eight veteran residents at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers’ Home who tested positive for the virus have died, officials said Tuesday, and it’s not known whether another person who died had Covid-19. Another 82 residents and 81 employees have tested positive. While the death toll continues to climb, federal officials are investigating whether residents were denied proper medical care. The state’s top prosecutor is deciding whether to bring legal action.Almost 18,000 more people with cancer in England could die after the coronavirus pandemic led hospitals to suspend treatment and deterred patients from seeking NHS care, research has found. Cancer experts claim that an extra 6,270 people in England who have been newly diagnosed with the disease could die from it over the next 12 months as a direct result of the disruption caused by coronavirus, and the additional toll taking into account all those living with cancer could be 17,915.Navy sailors who have been quarantined on Guam for weeks will begin moving back to the USS Theodore Roosevelt on Tuesday night, US officials said. A coronavirus outbreak sidelined the aircraft carrier in late March. The ship gained attention when it was forced to dock in Guam because of the virus outbreak and its commander was fired for sending an email pleading with Navy bosses to take faster action to address the virus.Films released on streaming platforms only will be eligible for Academy Awards next year because of the pandemic’s disruption to the industry, the organisers of the Oscars have said. The change will only apply to films released this year. Previously, a film would have required a minimum seven-day theatrical run in a Los Angeles county commercial theatre in order to be considered.

State media have not published a single photograph of Kim since, but they have carried reports of his daily routine, including diplomatic messages sent to other world leaders.Speculation that Kim was staying in Wonsan grew over the weekend after the Washington-based North Korea monitoring project 38 North said it had analysed satellite images showing his special train parked at the local station.On Tuesday, the NK News website said leisure boats often used by Kim had been active in the area throughout this month.North Korea sealed its border with China in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, quarantined thousands of people and scaled down public events. Observers are sceptical, though, of the regime’s claims that the country is free of the virus.Edwin Salvador, the World Health Organization’s representative to North Korea, said last week that the country reported that it tested 740 people for Covid-19 as of 17 April but that all of them were negative. The North said it had so far released more than 25,000 people from quarantine since late December, according to Salvador.Jiro Ishimaru, who heads the Osaka-based Asia Press website and operates a network of citizen journalists in North Korea, said confirmation that Kim was in isolation would prove that the virus had spread inside the country.“I don’t think he is dead – if that was the case there would be a lot more identifiable movement,” Ishimaru, who has spoken recently to North Koreans near the Chinese border, told the . “One theory is that either he himself has the virus or people around him have it and he’s is sheltering.”Ishimaru said it was possible that the regime had deliberately sent Kim’s train to Wonsan – knowing satellite images would be seen by analysts – to give the impression that he was simple taking a break when, in fact, he was self-isolating elsewhere.“All of the attention is on Wonsan, but there is a chance that he is fooling everyone,” Ishimaru said.Chad O’Carroll, the chief executive of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea, said any evidence that Kim was sheltering from the virus would “puncture a hole in the state media narrative of how this crisis has been perfectly managed”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdc00232331a2e30e142df050652bc250b189f0b/0_510_2870_1720/master/2870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe0579c3e3c3256d878ea5bd6e8f6005","title":"queen to address nation as part of ve day 75 anniversary celebrations remembrance","story":"Moment of remembrance and singalong of We’ll Meet Again also planned for anniversaryThe Queen will address the nation on the 75th anniversary of VE Day, on a day of thanksgiving culminating in a national singalong of We’ll Meet Again.Celebrations will take place in gardens, on doorsteps and in living rooms, rather than the street parties and parades envisaged before the Covid-19 pandemic.“I know the nation will come together to mark this historic occasion,” said the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden. “In these difficult times, acts of remembrance are even more poignant and I am sure that millions will want to join me to remember and give thanks to those who gave so much to secure peace, freedom and prosperity in Europe.”The Queen’s pre-recorded message will be broadcast on BBC One at 9pm on VE Day, 8 May, the same hour as her father, King George VI, made his radio address marking victory in Europe after what he called “nearly six years of suffering and peril”.Speaking from a bomb-scarred Buckingham Palace, in a London that was “war-battered but never for one moment daunted or dismayed”, he gave thanks in his broadcast on 8 May 1945 for “a great deliverance”.Seventy-five years on, Prince Charles will read an extract from a diary entry by his grandfather describing the day’s events, including the royal family’s Buckingham Palace balcony appearances. Later that day the then Princess Elizabeth and her sister, Princess Margaret, danced unnoticed among the cheering throngs on London’s streets, in what the monarch later described as one of the best nights of her life.The monarch’s message will be followed by the national singalong of We’ll Meet Again, made famous by Dame Vera Lynn, now 103. The public will be encouraged to open their doors and join in.The BBC’s broadcast of VE Day 75: The People’s Celebration will feature stars such as Katherine Jenkins, Adrian Lester and Anton du Beke, and renditions of songs from the 1930s and 40s. There will also be interviews with people reminiscing about the day.With the “golden generation” in lockdown, the BBC said: “We want to let them know that we have not forgotten the peace that they won for us, that we are thinking of them and that they are not alone, as well as cheering up the rest of the nation along the way.”Official commemorations will begin at 11am with a national moment of remembrance and two minutes’ silence. The archbishop of Canterbury will record a special reflection and moment of prayer. Winston Churchill’s address to the nation announcing Germany’s surrender will be broadcast on the BBC at 2.45pm.Though traditional street parties are cancelled, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport is encouraging people to get into the spirit of the day and has produced a special template pack so the public can hold a 1940s-style afternoon tea party at home, complete with bunting, recipes, games and other educational and creative activities.Members of the royal family will take part in a series of video calls with veterans of the second world war and those who served on the home front.“With members of the public unable to attend VE Day 75 events, we are calling on people across the UK to mark the anniversary from home and take part in these national moments of remembrance and thanksgiving,” said Bob Gamble, of the Royal British Legion.“There is no right or wrong way to take part in the silence at 11am: some people may wish to stand at their windows or step outside their front door, but we hope that iniduals and families across the UK will embrace the opportunity to share in a national moment of reflection.”The three national military service museums, (navy, army and air force) are hosting a virtual VE Day 75 festival online from 7-9 May and are encouraging people to decorate their homes and join in with a “make do and mend” session."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fa524691be3e206c89ace0698932b0c2e17b12c/0_0_5536_3322/master/5536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60f065762d3d74dc71b6a1b19f2d3d1","title":"was britain unprepared for a pandemic podcast","story":"As medics and carers report widespread shortages of protective equipment, the government is facing pressure to explain why it appears the UK went into a pandemic under-resourced.

Car parking at the quayside has been removed and the road is being resurfaced for the riverside section of the route.“The road surface was in poor condition where the cars were parked, so once that resurfacing work is completed, it will be replaced with the cycle track, which will be protected by a continuous fixed structure about half a metre high.”The next stage will involve minor road works to take the route to and from the riverside to the sections where it runs along the other side of the road beside buildings.The current work, which will concentrate on the area between the Phoenix Park and the Custom House, will involve the removal of traffic lanes in some sections and is expected to be completed by August.While the route will be fully segregated on the north quays, cyclists will continue to share with buses on sections of the south quays until the full permanent route, which involves additional boardwalks over the river, is completed by the National Transport Authority in 2024.Contraflow laneA new contraflow cycle lane is also being installed this week on Nassau Street and, when completed will run from Clare Street, beside the National Gallery to Dawson Street.This work is part of Covid 19 distancing measures, and will also involve the reallocation of roadspace to pedestrians on both sides of the road.There was a particular need to increase pedestrian space on the Trinity College side by removing bus parking, so that walkers could pass safely when people were queuing for buses. This would become increasingly important as people returned to the city centre in the coming months, Mr O’Brien said.“Nobody knows how long this is going to last, but we are assuming the distancing measures we are putting in place here and throughout the city, will be in place for a year and a half. In some places they may then be unwound, but others may be permanent.”The council last week requisitioned parking spaces for pedestrians outside shops at five locations, on Dorset Street, Stoneybatter, Capel Street, Fairview, and Rathmines. Similar work is underway in Ranelagh this week and additional spaces are being reallocated in Rathmines, Mr O’Brien said.“We have an online form where people can request locations, and we have already had a raft of requests which we are assessing at the moment.”"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA WireCafes and restaurants could reopen by the middle of the summer, with people allowed travel within Ireland for holidays by late summer, under plans being discussed to gradually lift the coronavirus lockdown. The  understands the early stages of plans being discussed by the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) would see retailers, cafes and restaurants reopen on a limited basis, with the tourist industry also reopening on a limited basis in the mid-stages. The phases are broken down as: initial phase, early phase stage one, early phase stage two, middle phases and late phases. The latter two phases could be broken down into more stages.Initial drafts of the plan spaced the phases out in periods between early May and September, although no dates are on the latest draft being considered by NPHET.Any easing of restrictions is entirely dependent on efforts to tackle the virus, and progress through the phases will not happen unless a number of key targets are met. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Health Simon Harris told the Cabinet on Tuesday that there are “no indications that disease levels are low enough to enable any easing of restrictions” when the current phase of lockdown ends after May 5th. Officials on Tuesday night conceded delays in ramping up testing capacity for Covid-19 are a factor in the likely decision not to lift lockdown restrictions at the end of this week.An inability to meet the target of providing 100,000 tests a week “feeds into” the stance of officials in relation to the lifting of restrictions, according to the head of the Government’s expert advisory group on the disease, Dr Cillian de Gascun.Weekly testingThe long-promised 100,000 weekly tests target is a critical step to help track infection rates as lockdown measures are relaxed in order to assess whether they are leading to new Covid-19 cases.The primary parameters influencing NPHET’s decision would be trends in case numbers, deaths and intensive care unit admissions, he said. Current laboratory capacity stands at 60,000 tests a week, but this would increase to 70,000 next week.Sources stressed that each phase of the plan, expected to be announced later this week, would contain a “menu” of actions that could be chosen. Specific actions could also be moved between phases. Social distancing will continue to apply through all phases.Under the latest draft, the first phase would allow the over-70s who are cocooning out to walk on a “no touch” basis allow outdoor workers such as builders and gardeners return to work allow a maximum of four people not from the same household gather outside while obeying social distancing recommence some restricted classes for Leaving Cert students potentially increase the distance people can travel outside their home for exercise from 2km to 5km or 10km allow retailers such as DIY and garden centres reopen and allow retail outlets deemed essential in an earlier round of restrictions – such as banks, repair shops, optometrists and others – open again.Family units Although flagged by some on NPHET in recent days, the broadening of family units is not seen as likely in the first phase. Other measures – such as the number of people allowed gather together – are also expected to be scaled up throughout the phases.The next phase – “early phase stage one” – would allow small retailers reopen by allowing only a limited number of staff and customers on the premises. Restrictions on travel away from the home could increase to 20km. Open marts could also recommence. “Early stage phase two” would see cafes and restaurants reopen, as long as social distancing and strict cleaning rules apply. The so-called “middle phases” would see the tourism industry – hotels, hostels, caravan parks – reopen on a limited occupancy basis. Travel restrictions would be further eased to allow people travel outside their regions. Any holidays or breaks should be taken by family units only.The “later phases” would see the wider reopening of the economy – such as pubs and offices – again if social distancing is implemented. Schools would also reopen in September, again complying with social distancing. Mass gatherings of over 5,000 people have already been effectively cancelled until September. Guidance around these events is unlikely to be provided until much later in the year, similar to family events such as weddings. Cocooning is also expected to last for the foreseeable future, until vaccines or treatments for Covid-19 are found.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4239222.1588009981!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove rejects eu request for mini embassy in belfast after brexit","story":"The British minister leading negotiations on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol has rejected a European Union request for what he described as “a mini-embassy” in Belfast.

PA Photo. Photograph: House of CommonsPA WireThe British minister leading negotiations on the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol has rejected a European Union request for what he described as “a mini-embassy” in Belfast.The EU wants to open an office in Northern Ireland to monitor checks and controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea after the end of the current transition period.But Michael Gove told a committee of MPs that Britain saw no reason for any permanent presence for the EU apart from its delegation’s headquarters in London.“Of course it is the case that the EU has the right to monitor the operation of what UK officials are doing but there’s no need for there to be a mini-embassy in Belfast in order for that to happen,” he told the House of Commons committee on the future relationship with the EU.In a letter to the European Commission, paymaster general Penny Mordaunt said any necessary monitoring could be carried out by means of ad hoc visits by EU officials to the North.Under the protocol, goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to EU customs controls unless they are explicitly exempt.Delicate balanceThe two sides agreed that checks should be carried out by the British authorities but that EU officials could monitor how they are implemented.“The proposition of a permanent EU office, with permanent staff whose primary purpose (as you acknowledge) would be to engage in a form of supervision of UK implementation of the protocol, is not consistent with the delicate balance of rights and responsibilities, on both parties, set out in the protocol,” Ms Mordaunt said.“Second, one of the primary purposes of the protocol is the protection of the BelfastGood Friday Agreement in all its dimensions. We must therefore aim to implement it in a way that is acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland and mitigates its effects on them. Both the EU and the UK face obligations in this regard and both sides must make special efforts to develop reasonable proposals in implementing the protocol. A special EU office, uniquely in the regions and nations of the UK, in order to implement a protocol that has attracted controversy, would in our view be isive in political and community terms.”Mr Gove was pressed on what steps his government was taking to prepare ports on either side of the Irish Sea for the customs checks that will be required under the protocol. But he insisted that “the\u0026nbspprecise nature of how the protocol will be implemented” will be determined in a specialised British-EU committee which holds its next meeting on Thursday.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Jim MoneAPUS vice-president Mike Pence chose not to wear a face mask during a tour of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota on Tuesday, an apparent violation of the world-renowned medical centre’s policy requiring them.Video feeds show Mr Pence did not wear a mask when he met with a Mayo employee who has recovered from coronavirus and is now donating plasma, even though all other people in the room appeared to be wearing one.He was also without a mask when he visited a lab where Mayo conducts tests for the virus, also known as Covid-19.And Mr Pence was the only participant not to wear a mask during a round table discussion on Mayo’s coronavirus testing and research programs. All other participants did, including Food and Drug Administration chief Stephen Hahn, top Mayo officials, state governor Tim Walz and federal politician Jim Hagedorn.Mayo tweeted that it had informed the vice-president of its mask policy prior to his arrival. The tweet was later removed. Mayo officials did not directly respond to a request for comment on why it was removed, or at whose request.“Mayo shared the masking policy with the VP’s office,” the health care system said in its response.Mr Pence explained his decision by stressing he had been frequently tested for the virus.“As vice-president of the United States I’m tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus,” Mr Pence said, adding that he is following CDC guidelines, which indicate that the mask is good for preventing the spread of the virus by those who have it.“And since I don’t have the coronavirus, I thought it’d be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible healthcare personnel, and look them in the eye and say: ‘Thank you’.”Mr Pence is not the only White House official who has shown a reluctance for face masks.When US president Donald Trump announced new federal guidelines recommending Americans wear face coverings when in public, he immediately said he had no intention of following that advice himself, saying: “I’m choosing not to do it.”Mr Pence also went without a mask a week earlier when he visited a GE Healthcare facility that makes ventilators.Some at the event in Madison, Wisconsin, wore masks and others did not.The White House said then that Mr Pence had tested negative for the coronavirus and suggested that under the guidelines developed by the coronavirus task force there was no need for him to wear a mask.-APEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, goCoronavirus latest news: Government minister rows back from testing targetComment: Singapore\u0026#39s coronavirus lockdown offers a great warning about the risk of going wobblyWhy UK\u0026#39s death toll could soon be the worst in Europe - in chartsThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayWalker dressing as 17th century plague doctor to be offered \u0026#39words of advice\u0026#39 by policeThis map shows the UK\u0026#39s testing blackspotsWednesday morning news briefing: Key rule to lift lockdown easedComment: With rogue states happy to exploit coronavirus, we cannot afford to let our guard downChina accuses Australia of \u0026#39petty tricks\u0026#39 as dispute over coronavirus outbreak inquiry intensifiesChina\u0026#39s parliament set to return after coronavirus caused country\u0026#39s near-standstillKim Jong-un\u0026#39s successor: Who would lead North Korea if he died?The charts that show the real UK coronavirus death toll is much higher than first fearedHow many coronavirus cases are in the UK - and where are they?How to book a coronavirus test if you\u0026#39re a key workerFormer Republican Justin Amash exploring 2020 run for Libertarian presidential nominationWhat the second coronavirus wave means for the UK\u0026#39s exit strategyHow far is the UK from passing the five tests for lifting the coronavirus lockdown?Key rule in Government\u0026#39s five tests for lifting coronavirus lockdown is softened We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"germans urged stay home key virus measurement rises","story":"Health authorities in Germany on Tuesday urged people to stay at home as much as possible after a key measurement of the coronavirus outbreak briefly rose above government targets.The reproduction factor  — the average number of people each infected passes the virus on to — briefly rose to 1 on Monday evening before falling back to 0.9 on Tuesday.“We don\u0027t want the number of cases to increase again. We don\u0027t want the health system to be overwhelmed. We don\u0027t want more people to die from Covid 19,” said Prof Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s infectious disease centre. “We must stick to the contact restrictions, keep at least 1.5 m apart and cover our mouths and noses on public transport and in shops,” he appealed to the public.Angela Merkel identified the reproduction factor, also known as R0, as a crucial factor in deciding to lift Germany’s lockdown, and government scientists have declared keeping it below 1 as a key target.But Prof Wieler downplayed the brief rise, which he said was within normal fluctuation rates. The total number of infections in Germany has fallen over recent days, he stressed.  “It is important not to take the number out of context, because the reproduction factor does not tell you the actual number of infections,” he said.In what was seen as a major success in the fight against coronavirus, the German reproduction factor fell to 0.7 last week. Since then it has generally been steady at around 0.9.Germany began to lift its lockdown last week as shops were allowed to reopen. Mrs Merkel has publicly criticised Germany’s regional governments for lifting lockdown measures too quickly, but government scientists said it is too early for this to have caused the brief rise in the reproduction factor.The figure is based on forecast estimates of infection rates because there is a lag of 10-14 days in new infections being detected.There is speculation in Germany the rise may have been caused by people socialising over Easter weekend.But Prof Wieler stressed the actual rise was very small. The R0 only reached 0.96 on Monday but the figure was rounded up to the nearest decimal place.Separately, Germany could introduce tickets for access to shopping areas to prevent overcrowding under proposals reportedly put forward by business leaders.The German Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reportedly submitted proposals for an app-based system that would issue timed tickets for people to enter pedestrianised shopping streets, shopping centres and hotels.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"map shows testing blackspots uk","story":"More than a million people in the UK live over an hour from their nearest coronavirus testing centre, new  analysis has revealed. Some of the worst areas for connectivity to a regional testing centre are Norfolk, Cornwall, North Wales and the Scottish Borders. Some 43 regional testing centres were available for the public on 28 April, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Fifteen of these have opened in the last week, as the Government scrambled to hit its aim of having 48 open by the end of April.The drive-through network aims to provide thousands of swab tests for critical key workers, to identify if they currently have coronavirus.But using road travel times from the TravelTime mapping service, analysis shows that these testing centres leave vast areas of Wales, Scotland, East of England and the South West without significant coverage. In addition to these regional testing centres, the Department of Health and Social Care said there were a further 16 satellite testing centres to detect coronavirus. At least half of these are healthcare facilities which have particularly urgent need for test kits.The department also plans for 11 mobile testing centres - based at Nottingham, Wembley, Gateshead, Leeds, Manchester, Gatwick, Plymouth, Edgbaston, Stansted Airport, Preston and Bristol - to provide further cover, along with home-testing kits.None of these satellite testing centres or planned mobile testing centres tackle the under-represented areas of Norfolk, North Wales or the Scottish Borders. Experts have warned that testing capacity has to be increased across the country in order to lift the lockdown. Professor Karol Sikora, a private oncologist and Dean of Medicine at the University of Buckingham, told The : “\u0027There is no question - we were far too slow off the mark with testing which was not helped by a lack of pre-existing infrastructure.“We can\u0027t fight this virus blind, we need to follow South Korea and Germany\u0027s lead and use testing to hunt the virus down.“There are logistical issues. Getting these tests to the people that need them is challenging. Embracing spare capacity in private labs could help solve this problem.”The worst areas for connectivity are Cornwall and Norwich, home to large populations and yet more than an hour’s drive from a test centre. Some 200,000 people live in Norwich alone, living over an hour from their closest testing centre at the Copdock Park and Ride in Ipswich. Likewise, the Tipner Lorry Park in Portsmouth opened on 21 April - but this is still more than an hour\u0027s drive from Cornish population hubs such as Truro and Newquay.There is no regional testing centre on the Isle of Wight.The Government has been criticised for its slow increase in testing across the UK, with it looking unlikely to hit its own 100,000-a-day coronavirus testing target.Figures show 29,000 tests were carried out in the latest 24-hour period of data available to the government. This does not include tests carried out over the weekend.A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Our aim as we tackle this virus is to make it easy, fast and simple for any essential worker who needs a test, to get a test.“In addition to setting up a nationwide network of drive in testing sites, we have introduced home testing kit delivery, deployed mobile testing units operated by the Armed Forces, and built three new ‘mega labs’ to analyse test samples.“This is in addition to more than doubling the capacity of the NHS and Public Health England laboratories, all in a matter of weeks. 569,768 people have now been tested in the UK, and the vast majority report no issues with the process. We are determined to ensure that everyone who needs a test can get one.”The standard international test for coronavirus is quantitative, making it relatively easy to measure how much virus they are making - known as the \u0027viral load\u0027. This could be crucial in determining not only how infectious a person is, but also how dangerous their passing on coronavirus can be.In order to calculate the numbers behind this story, the Department of Health and Social Care provided us with a list of regional testing sites as of 27 April 2020.

Public Health England (PHE) and the NHS were ordered to investigate a possible link between coronavirus and the illness in children.It\u0027s a new disease that we think may be caused by coronavirus and the Covid-19 virus, Mr Hancock said. We\u0027re not 100 per cent sure, because some of the people who got it hadn\u0027t tested positive, so we\u0027re doing a lot of research now but it is something that we\u0027re worried about.Around 20 children have been diagnosed with the syndrome so far, it is understood. Of those, around half tested positive for Covid-19, while the other half did not. At least 12 have been transferred to intensive care after suffering inflamed hearts and kidney problems.The NHS alert likened the new syndrome to Kawasaki disease, a condition causing leaky blood vessels that usually affects children under five years old.But scientists and doctors advising Societi, the UK Kawasaki disease foundation, said on Tuesday that hospital admissions data did not yet point to a link with coronavirus.The group, which includes doctors from Great Ormond Street and Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, said it welcomed the PHE investigation but pointed out that admissions for Kawasaki disease had fallen compared to the same period last year.In a statement, the group said: Fewer cases of Kawasaki disease than would be normally expected at this time of year are currently being seen, not more.Kawasaki disease is a seasonal inflammatory disorder peaking in the winter and spring, and whilst no infection has ever been proven to be the sole trigger, the scientific community believe that any one of many infections may trigger Kawasaki disease in susceptible children. We are aware of recent delayed presentations of Kawasaki disease because of initial incorrect diagnoses of Covid-19, resulting in adverse coronary outcomes due to delayed institution of treatment. During the last Sars epidemic, the same links to new cases of Kawasaki disease were reported, but these have since been disproven.A source on the committee said there was a level of anger at the decision to make the NHS alert public before gathering enough evidence to prove a link to coronavirus.Meanwhile, other countries announced that they had launched similar investigations into a reported rise in children needing critical treatment after contracting coronavirus.In northern Italy, one of the world\u0027s hardest-hit areas in the pandemic, doctors have reported large numbers of children under the age of nine with severe cases of what appears to be Kawasaki disease. The Spanish Pediatric Association said doctors had seen children either testing positive for Covid-19 or its antibodies suffering abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea in the last two weeks.The children were otherwise in good health but their condition could deteriorate within hours into shock, with tachycardia and hypotension. Most cases were school aged, with symptoms overlapping with Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, the organisation said.Profess Simon Kenny, the NHS national clinical director for children and young people, said: Thankfully, Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast.The advice to parents remains the same – if you are worried about your child for whatever reason, contact NHS 111 or your family doctor for urgent advice, or 999 in an emergency. And if a professional tells you to go to hospital, please go to hospital.The Department of Health said officials were not aware of any confirmed deaths from the new syndrome. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korean study shows alarming spread covid 19 offices","story":"Scientists have tracked the aggressive pace at which the coronavirus can sweep through an open plan office based on data from a call centre outbreak in South Korea. The research by the Korean Centres for Disease Control focusses on a cluster that emerged in early March in a 19-storey building in a bustling district of Seoul, South Korea’s capital. Commercial offices are located on the 1st to 11th floors with residential apartments from the 13th to 19th. Of 1,143 people tested for Covid-19 in the building, 97 had confirmed cases, and of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call centre with 216 employees, indicating an “attack rate” of 43.5 percent,” researchers said in the study published in the CDC’s journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases.  “The magnitude of the outbreak illustrates how a high-density work environment can become a high-risk site for the spread of Covid-19 and potentially a source of further transmission.”However, on a more positive note, despite considerable contact between workers on different floors in the elevators and the lobby, the spread of Covid-19 “was limited almost exclusively to the 11th floor, which indicates that the duration of interaction was likely the main facilitator,” they added.“Our data might represent the likely proportion of asymptomatic COVID-19 infections in the community setting,” it said.  The call centre cluster was contained through mass testing of the entire building, strict quarantines for positive and suspected cases and extensive contact-tracing.A total of 16,628 text messages were sent to people who had stayed more than five minutes near the building during the outbreak. The message recipients were tracked using cell phone location data and urged to avoid contact with others and to take a Covid-19 test. Experts say South Korea has managed to avoid lockdowns or business bans through its aggressive “trace, test, treat” plan.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 29th april 2020","story":"A selection of the 125,000 birthday cards that have been sent to Captain Tom Moore, for his 100th birthday displayed in the Great Hall of Bedford School. 99-year-old Moore captured the hearts of the UK after initially setting out to raise just £1,000 for the NHS following the novel coronavirus outbreak, by walking 100 laps of his 25-metre garden. He has gone on to brake the record for raising the most money in an inidual charity walk, more than £27 millionComment: Singapore\u0026#39s coronavirus lockdown offers a great warning about the risk of going wobblyWhy UK\u0026#39s death toll could soon be the worst in Europe - in chartsCoronavirus latest news: US tops 1 million cases as death toll passes Vietnam War milestoneThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and Alexa twice a dayWalker dressing as 17th century plague doctor to be offered \u0026#39words of advice\u0026#39 by policeThis map shows the UK\u0026#39s testing blackspotsWednesday morning news briefing: Key rule to lift lockdown easedComment: With rogue states happy to exploit coronavirus, we cannot afford to let our guard downChina accuses Australia of \u0026#39petty tricks\u0026#39 as dispute over coronavirus outbreak inquiry intensifiesChina\u0026#39s parliament set to return after coronavirus caused country\u0026#39s near-standstillKim Jong-un\u0026#39s successor: Who would lead North Korea if he died?The charts that show the real UK coronavirus death toll is much higher than first fearedHow many coronavirus cases are in the UK - and where are they?How to book a coronavirus test if you\u0026#39re a key workerFormer Republican Justin Amash exploring 2020 run for Libertarian presidential nominationWhat the second coronavirus wave means for the UK\u0026#39s exit strategyHow far is the UK from passing the five tests for lifting the coronavirus lockdown?Key rule in Government\u0026#39s five tests for lifting coronavirus lockdown is softened These are the NHS workers who have died from coronavirusWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/07/09/trolls-world-tour.jpg","title":"amc theatres universal movie ban trolls world tour stream online home","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.‘Trolls World Tour’ made an estimated $100m on home rentals during lockdownThe world’s largest cinema chain, AMC, will no longer distribute Universal films following comments made about the success of Trolls World Tour’s home release.With coronavirus bringing the film industry to a halt, Universal moved the Trolls sequel to video on demand on 10 April, making an estimated $100m in North America in the three weeks since.\u0026nbspAddressing the future of film release, NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that even after cinemas reopened, the company would keep releasing films in both formats.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn rebuttal, AMC Theatres chair-CEO Adam Aron wrote a letter to Universal Filmed Entertainment Group chairman Donna Langley branding Shell’s words “unacceptable”.“It is disappointing to us, but Jeff’s comments as to Universal’s unilateral actions and intentions have left us with no choice,” he wrote. “Therefore, effectively immediately AMC will no longer play any Universal movies in any of our theatres in the United States, Europe or the Middle East.”My favourite sports documentary – OJ: Made in AmericaHow The Simpsons made Sideshow Bob into one of TV’s favourite villainsAron continued: “This policy affects any and all Universal movies per se, goes into effect today and as our theatres reopen, and is not some hollow or ill-considered threat. Incidentally, this policy is not aimed solely at Universal out of pique or to be punitive in any way… Universal is the only studio contemplating a wholesale change to the status quo.”AMC were supported by the National Association of Theatre Owners, who weighed in and said that the success of Trolls World Tour was positive, but not “the new normal”.“Universal does not have reason to use unusual circumstances in an unprecedented environment as a springboard to bypass true theatrical releases,” said president and CEO John Fithian.Universal has denied attempting to sever ties with cinemas and claims that Shell’s comments were misconstrued in a “seemingly coordinated attempt from AMC and NATO to confuse our position and our actions”.video on demand\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is not a matter of money but of life and death,” D\u0027Hooghe told Sky Sports News in an interview on Tuesday.This is the most dramatic situation we have lived in since the Second World War. We should not underestimate it, we must be realistic,” he added regarding the pandemic which has forced the game\u0027s suspension in almost all countries.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe comments of the veteran Belgian football administrator come as the Bundesliga moves towards a possible re-start next month, while the Premier League is hoping games could be played behind closed doors in June.D\u0027Hooghe said it was too early for players to be coming into contact with one another, at least while social distancing regulations are in place.Spitting should be banned due to coronavirus, says Fifa doctorFifa to allow teams five subs per match due to fitness concernsFifa begin payments to all nations from $150m coronavirus relief fundThe world is not ready for competitive football, I hope this can change very quickly and I sincerely hope that. Today you need more patience, added D’Hooghe, a doctor who was formerly a member of Fifa’s powerful executive committee.Football can only be possible if contact is possible again. Football remains a contact sport and contact is one of the first things everyone says that you should avoid.It\u0027s still about social distancing. Testing is an important point but you have to repeat them (tests). If one of the players becomes positive, you have to put the whole group into quarantine. Is that a solution for a normal competition?” he asked.We do not know when it will reach its peak in different countries, it will be different in every country. The solution will only be there the day there is an adequate vaccination programme.D\u0027Hooghe also said changes needed to be made to rules and regulations whenever football returns to allow referees to caution players who are seen to spit during matches.It\u0027s a common practice in football but it\u0027s not very hygienic, he added.The latest football headlines direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the government was heavily criticised for its failure to provide equipment to medical staff, Sarah says she\u0027s never had to enter a Covid-19 ward without PPE, but has “probably worn about five to six different types of gowns and visors and masks, depending on the stock and the flow and the amount of different stuff available at different sites.”You can read about the interview here.You can subscribe to the series on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Acast or wherever you listen.

I admire him so much, he’s one of my favourite actors, but I remember walking out feeling kind of shaken that he had gone after me in a way that was completely weirdly uncalled for.”Speaking to Washington in 2004 during promotion for his political thriller The Manchurian Candidate, Couric asked the Oscar winner if he agreed with the claim that “Hollywood folks should stick to acting”.“I don’t know what Hollywood folks are, first of all,” Washington replied. “Hollywood is a town that has some stars on the sidewalk. I don’t know anybody from there … That’s like calling you a ‘type’ of folks. I’m not a Hollywood folk. I don’t know who they are.”Bollywood icon and Life of Pi actor Irrfan Khan dies aged 53How The Simpsons made Sideshow Bob into one of TV’s favourite villains“OK, all right, well, let me rephrase the question,” Couric said. “Are you one of those people that – ”Washington then interrupted, saying: “Ah, there you go. ‘Am I one of those people?’ Hmmm, isn’t that interesting?”After Couric attempted to explain her question, Washington said: “No, don’t stop. I heard what you just said. ‘Am I one of those people?’ No, I’m not.”Couric rephrased her question again, asking, “Are you an actor who would rather not – ”, but Washington interrupted her again.“No, I’m not that either,” Washington said. “I’m a human being. My job is acting.”Couric told Pellegrino that Washington later “wrote a big cheque” to her colon cancer foundation, potentially as an apology, adding: “I think he must have been having a really bad day.”In The Manchurian Candidate, which also starred Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, Washington played a war veteran who discovers that US soldiers are being brainwashed by the government.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Users will be able to filter Peloton\u0027s huge leaderboard – which can include tens of thousands of people –\u0026nbspdown to just the people they know from a given group.The feature was built to respond to the fact that many Peloton users have already formed their own on other social networks, David Packles, Peloton\u0027s director of product, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. Groups have formed around a whole range of different things, with communities of people representing everything from specific ways of working out to different body types.Many of those groups already represent themselves by adding hashtags into their usernames or the field that usually displays a person\u0027s location. The new feature was built to respond to that unintended usage to give people a more organised way of keeping up with the people they follow, Mr Pickles said.Mr Pickles said he was expecting that people would use the new group feature similarly, potentially in a variety of ways that Peloton had not been able to anticipate. But the company has installed a variety of algorithms and other systems that watch to ensure the new feature cannot be used abusively or maliciously, he said.While the feature comes as people are stuck at home because of the coronavirus pandemic, Mr Pickles confirmed that the app has been in development for many, many months, and was not specifically launched because of recent events. New features would usually have been announced at Peloton\u0027s annual Homecoming event the coming weekend, but that has been cancelled this year because of the outbreak.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

The company said that was not arriving in the latest update.It also said there would be no changes to its chat feature, which currently allows people to talk to each other through video calls while they are on the bike. That is still limited to one-to-one calls, at least for the time being.Peloton is far from the only app adding new group features amid lockdowns around the world. Cycling training app Trainer Road, for instance, recently rolled out group workouts that allow a variety of users to do the same exercise while talking to each other over built-in group video chat.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On a normal day we would fly more than 300.

one-quarter.Gatwick airport is likely to be much harder hit than BA’s main base, Heathrow.Profitability at the Sussex airport has always been poorer than at Heathrow. In addition, the airline will be keen to retain its slot portfolio at Heathrow, where it currently operates just over half the total take\u0026nbspoffs and landings.BA’s fleet will also shrink significantly. The carrier has already flown some of its ageing Boeing 747s to be scrapped, and the future of its 12 Airbus A380 “SuperJumbo” aircraft is uncertain.The British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa) called BA’s announcement “a bolt out of the blue”.The pilots’ union’s general secretary, Brian Strutton said: “BA pilots and all staff are devastated by the announcement of up to 12,000 possible job losses in British Airways.“This has come as a bolt out of the blue from an airline that said it was wealthy enough to weather the Covid storm and declined any government support.“Balpa does not accept that a case has been made for these job losses and we will be fighting to save every single one.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Indeed, they have become four times as frequent\u0026nbspin the past half-century.Since the 1970s, it is\u0026nbspestimated at least three dozen infectious diseases have emerged from human interference with animals, including Sars, Mers, Ebola, bird flu, swine flu and the Zika virus. As far back as 2007 the World Health Organisation warned that infectious diseases were emerging at a rate that had not been seen before.The spread of the viruses is put down to a deadly combination of wildlife trafficking and consumption, increasing human encroachment into wildlife habitats as more people live in densely populated areas – and air travel, which enables pathogens to take hold globally.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThree years ago, an article\u0026nbsppublished by the US National Centre for Biotechnology Information stated, presciently: “The Aids and influenza pandemics have claimed and will continue to claim millions of lives. The recent Sars and Ebola epidemics have threatened populations across borders. The emergence of Mers may well be warning signals of a nascent pandemic threat.”Zoonotic diseases are complex, and it’s sometimes impossible to say a virus has disappeared, because it might have many different strains, and might mutate and lie dormant. This is a timeline of the main zoonotic diseases to have hit us since the start of the 20th century:Wildlife trade continues in Asia amid calls for restrictions China tries to shut down wildlife trade but markets remain openBlack-market trade ‘may undermine Vietnam ban on disease-rife markets’Stray dogs eating bat meat ‘could have sparked coronavirus pandemic’The 1918 flu pandemic: This was the most severe pandemic in modern times, killing at least 50 million people in two years. It is widely believed that the virus originated in birds because it shared genetic mutations with the bird flu virus later found in Asia, and could have transferred to horses in the trenches of the first world war before spreading to humans. This is disputed, with one study suggesting it came from mammals.Asian flu, 1957:\u0026nbspIn February 1957, a new influenza virus, known as H2N2 emerged in east Asia, which spread into a pandemic. It originated from an avian influenza virus, causing an estimated 1.1 million deaths worldwide.HIV: First identified in 1981, the disease is thought to have been acquired by people in central Africa hunting chimpanzees and coming into contact with their infected blood. However, studies show that HIV may have jumped from apes to humans as far back as the late 1800s, and it has existed in the West since at least the mid to late 1970s. HIV has killed about 35 million people to date, according to the World Health Organisation.Sars:\u0026nbspSevere acute respiratory syndrome is another type of coronavirus, which killed at least 770 people globally in an epidemic in 2002-3. Most victims were in southern China, Vietnam and Singapore. Scientists are not certain of its origins but like Covid-19 it’s thought it could have come from bats and spread to other animals such as civet cats, which are commonly sold in squalid conditions in street markets. The epidemic resulted in more than 8,000 cases, in 26 countries. Of those, 774 died.Swine flu: In 2009-2010 a new strain of flu emerged in pigs in Mexico. The H1N1 virus killed nearly tens of thousands of people in a global pandemic that spread to 214 countries in less than a year. However, overall the outbreak was not as serious as originally predicted, largely because many older people were already immune to it. And the NHS says it now circulates each year and is considered a normal seasonal flu strain, which is covered by the annual seasonal flu vaccine. A study in 2013 suggested between 123,000 and 200,000 people globally may have died as a result of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.Mers:\u0026nbspFirst identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome is also a coronavirus whose symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. With an estimated death rate of 35 per cent, the disease has killed 858 people, according to the WHO. Again, scientists think it spread to humans from bats, this time via camels.Ebola: A 2014–2016 outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976, killing 11,300 people. Scientists say it began with a child in Guinea who came into contact with infected bats, but it has since been widely linked to the killing and butchering of bush meat, including monkeys, chimps, antelopes, fruit bats, porcupines and rats.Zika: First identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, the mosquito-borne virus caused alarm in 2015, when it was thought to be the cause of thousands of cases of microcephaly – a shorter-than-normal head – in babies in Brazil. Outbreaks soon appeared throughout the Americas, Africa and other regions. It was thought to have killed 29 babies.Bird flu: Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, has many different strains but one of those, H7N9, has caused 1,568 cases in humans and 616 deaths worldwide since 2013, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations.Another strain of the virus, H5N1, first identified in 1997, spread across east and southeast Asia, killing six people in Hong Kong and leading to vast swathes of chickens and turkeys – from Hong Kong to Britain – having to be culled early after contracting the disease. To date 861 cases of human H5N1 infection and 455 deaths have been reported.\u0026nbspThe highest number of infections and deaths were in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. The H5N1 virus, which has a 60 per cent mortality rate among infected humans, according to WHO, has not gone away, but is thought to have mutated.Bird flu has been linked to rapid intensification of the poultry industry, with thousands of birds crowded together indoors and with compromised immune systems.The Independent is campaigning against the wildlife trade at the core of the Covid-19 pandemic.\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The terms of eligibility are\u0026nbspstill not clear.The London mayor said he was “extremely concerned” to hear that there had\u0026nbspalready been confirmed cases of Covid-19 in immigration removal centres, and called on Ms Patel to consider that those held in detention\u0026nbspwho aren’t any danger to the public should be released “without delay”.Mr Khan also urged the department\u0026nbspto suspend both the habitual residence test and the no recourse to public funds (NRPF) condition — which prevents people on certain visas from accessing state benefits — to enable people to get the support they need and to help stop the spread of the virus by those who feel they have no choice but to go out to work.He adds in the letter: “I recognise and welcome some of the changes your department has already made to meet the needs of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in the UK, however, I remain deeply concerned that some policies are risking Londoners’ public health and I am writing today to ask you to go further.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is a charity that has adapted with incredible speed to the crisis to help the most vulnerable in our community. In just five weeks, they have responded to the increased demand for food by quadrupling their output. We hope that our donation, coupled with the campaigning power of The Independent, will help the project grow and reach as many as possible of the one in five Londoners at risk of food poverty.”Another substantial contribution came in yesterday from the Julia and Hans Rausing Trust, which has assigned £16.5m\u0026nbspto charities at the forefront of the coronavirus pandemic and has donated £50,000 to our appeal.How to support our campaignJulia and Hans Rausing,\u0026nbspheirs of food packing giant Tetra Pak, said: “We have been impressed not only by the speed of The Felix Project’s response to the crisis, but the way in which they have managed to get a number of organisations working together to help people across the capital. Efforts like this support communities across London at this time of need, and we are glad to support their inspiring work.”We launched our appeal, in association with the Evening Standard, on Friday 27 March\u0026nbspand have reached £3m\u0026nbspthanks to the generous backing of dozens of London foundations, philanthropists and corporations, including Garfield Weston Foundation, Lansdowne Partners, the Westminster Foundation, Sir Peter Blake, Burberry, Eranda Rothschild Foundation, Citibank and investment holding company Temasek.More than 1,170 members of the public have contributed, donating £103,837 on our Virgin Money Giving page.But there is a sense that we are still in the foothills of the economic crisis, with experts warning the government that food poverty is about to get far worse. The Food Foundation has reported that eight million people in Britain face food insecurity and that three million have been missing meals since lockdown. The Institute for Social and Economic Research at University of Essex estimates that 6.5 million jobs could be lost in the coming months, causing a huge rise in demand for free food.As the biggest supplier of free food in London, The Felix Project has been operating 12 hours a day, six days a week, distributing surplus food to giant community hubs, including Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in Haringey, as well as to 80 charities and schools across the capital.The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

A nurse said meals cooked with fresh Felix produce made her feel “that little bit stronger”.All told of their relief\u0026nbspat being able to access healthy food, thanks to The Felix Project, one of the biggest food redistributors in the country, which has quadrupled daily deliveries to 40 tons since the outbreak of the virus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesYesterday, in a sign of further upward spiralling demand, The Felix Project broke its own record, ferrying an extraordinary 44 tons to 73 schools and charities, with the heftiest deliveries going to 11 community super-hubs set up by councils as part of a pan-London effort to tackle food poverty in the wake of Covid-19.Felix, on its own, is now supplying more than 100,000 meals a day, up from 20,000 at the start of the outbreak. This is what some of the beneficiaries, volunteers and charities had to say.How to support our campaignFamily at high riskKaren Barnes suffers from type 1 diabetes, an underactive thyroid and chronic back pain, and is a carer for her son, Aidan, six, who has health issues that affect his immune system“We receive two boxes of Felix-supplied food a week, from Enfield Children and Young Persons Services, as my son and I are both categorised as high risk. We felt a bit hopeless about being in isolation. I don’t have much family and you don’t want to be a burden on other people. So these boxes are a lifeline. It’s exciting when they come as we’re on our own. The person who delivers them leaves them on my doorstep and we chat. It’s a nice interaction.Kim Pallas is a nurse working 12-hour shifts at Barnet Hospital. She picks up dozens of cooked meals to give to her colleagues, made each day by BreadnButter, a charity supplied by The Felix Project.“All the patients in our hospital ward are coronavirus patients so it’s been difficult – very emotional and overwhelming at times. You’re just so grateful when fresh, healthy food is put in front of you and you don’t have to think about doing all the cooking.“The support of the food charities is making a massive difference to people like us. To know people care enough about you to do this makes you feel that little bit stronger to cope with all that’s going on during the crisis. It makes you feel valued.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She struggles to make ends meet and has claimed universal credit since her husband died suddenly from lung cancer five months ago.“I collect food parcels from my children’s school in Enfield once a week. We are in a very hard situation. When my husband died, my life was turned upside down. I was alone but had to look after my 11-year-old son David and six-year-old daughter Ola. I work so I’m lucky, but life is expensive. Felix is a huge help and – now that we are in isolation – so important. We leave the house once a week to collect our parcel so it’s the best part of our week.”Justine, 38, is a mother-of-four who escaped an abusive relationship and lives in temporary housing, claiming universal credit.“I first heard about The Felix Project through my six-year-old son’s school and have been picking up weekly packages since the end of last year.“At the moment, we are in isolation and things are tough, but Felix is a lifeline. I have used food banks in the past but they do not provide fresh food. There are luxury items in my Felix boxes that I could never afford, like Innocent Smoothies and mozzarella cheese. Picking up our box from the school is a weekly highlight. I don’t know what we would do without it.”James Quayle is manager of North Paddington Food Bank: “Before coronavirus we were feeding 100 households per week but now we are supporting more than 600 families. We used to be open one day a week with The Felix Project delivering a single truckload of fresh produce, but since Covid we are open six days a week.We have increased our volunteers from a couple of dozen to almost 300 and I am working 14-hour days. The only other comparable thing was the start of the Syrian refugee crisis when I was on Lesbos and witnessed people coming off boats. Similarly, this feels like a tidal wave.”James Smart, 36, is a volunteer at Made up Kitchen. The Hackney-based project had been bringing various groups together for regular “community feasts”. It stepped up to the crisis by delivering around 500 nutritious meals each week to people in the area who are struggling financially, thanks to 12 crates of surplus food given by The Felix Project each week.Mr Smart – a chef and market trader who had been working at a cheese stall before it had to close – is now giving two days a week as one of half a dozen volunteers cooking and coordinating deliveries with Made up Kitchen.“Like a lot of people my own situation feels uncertain,” he said. “This crisis has hit almost everyone in one way or another, which is quite scary. But it’s great that so many people have been getting out and doing something that matters for their community. We’re doing as much as we can right now, but there’s a lot of people who will need help.”He added: “The Felix Project has been such a massive help. It’s so important they can operate on such a big scale across London because it makes so much of the work of smaller groups possible.”The Independent\u0026nbspis encouraging readers to help groups that are trying to feed the hungry across the country – find out how you can help\u0026nbsphere.

Building on successful pilots, we will be rolling out testing of asymptomatic residents and staff in care homes in England and to patients and staff in the NHS.This will mean anyone who is working and living in a care home will be able to have access to a test, whether they have symptoms or not.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

the\u0026nbspcommunity, rather than just hospitals.Professor John Newton, co-ordinator of the national testing effort, said studies had shown that the\u0026nbsppresence of symptoms was not really a

As we remember those who died, now is the time to commit to fight for the living.“When those whose workplaces have been closed begin to return to work, they deserve to know that they are doing so safely. There is an urgent need for the government to provide proper resources to save the lives of workers during the crisis and restore long-term funding so that all workplaces can be made safe.”The party also highlighted that there had been a fall in the number of prosecutions, pointing to reports the Health and Safety Executive helped secure 361 convictions in 2018-19 – a drop of 46 per cent from 2015-16.Sarah Albon, the chief executive of the Health and Safety Executive, added in a blogpost published on International Workers’ Day: “It’s significance for us, as the national workplace health and safety regulator, really can’t be overstated.“The opportunity to take a minute (even virtually), to reflect and to remember those who’ve died at or because of work is so valuable and a clear reminder of why the Health and Safety Executive exists.”A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions – responsible for funding the body – said: “We spend around £130 million a year supporting the Health and Safety Executive to safeguard workplaces with integrity, professionalism and rigour – making Great Britain one of the safest places to work in the world.“HSE is playing a crucial role in the government’s response to Covid-19 and we will continue to work closely to ensure it has the resources it needs moving forward.”Health and Safety Executive\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

WhatsApp said that it had seen people all over the world are turning to voice and video calling on\u0026nbspWhatsApp\u0026nbspmore than ever before.Facebook had announced the new update last week as part of a range of new features coming to its chat apps. As well as the expanded WhatsApp group calling, it said also that it would launch new, huge Messenger meetings and new ways of going live on Instagram.It also noted that WhatsApp is available on Portal, Facebook\u0027s device for the home, which includes a camera and a microphone to allow people to talk to friends.

Is raising taxes the wrong approach or the Governments only option One surprise of this crisis has been how easily Britons have accepted the lockdown . Some people seem to positively enjoy it.To some it brings back the spirit of the Blitz a feeling of solidarity. To others fewer cars and planes are an indication of the more green lestyle we ought to be living.Its good that people have managed to cope with these restrictions. But when polls indicate that many people would be prepared to put up with a y extension of the lockdown I begin to worry.An economic interruption of this kind carries massive costs and can only be borne for a limited period. Any extension will become extremely dficult for the economy to bear.The OBR, the Governments independent forecaster, floated the possibility of a fall in output of the economy of  per cent for the period April to June.That is beyond anything that has previously been imagined. It wasn’t a definite forecast butit happened the effects on jobs and living standards would be more than devastating.Some describe this economic crisis as the worst in modern times. It may be the worst ever. That doesn’t mean we cant recover. We can and we certainly will.But its important to be patient. Commentators talk about the economy bouncing back, a so called V shaped recovery.This seems unlikely The economy may bounce back but only up to a certain point not necessarily the same point as before. Some firms will have gone out of business, others will have run up debts, some have missed orders that aren’t repeated.How long all these problems last depends on the lockdown. The longer the lockdown, the deeper the downturn. So it is vitally urgent that the Government relax the lockdown as soon as the scientists feel that the peak of the epidemic has been flattened and that it is appropriate.This isn’t about choosing the economy or lives. A flattened economy costs lives too. Even when we relax the lockdown many will still be nervous and may not want to go out to spend money.The continuing need for social distancing will pose problems for hospitality and other businesses and hold back a full recovery. Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor has been bold, promising to do “whatever it takes” to steer the economy through these perilous waters.His scheme for furloughing jobs with the Government paying up to £ a month of peoples wages has helped to prevent firms getting rid of people that they could not afford But it is eye wateringly expensive with costs estimated at up to £billion.Clearly it cannot continue indefinitely. Ironically the generosity of the scheme may have anaesthetised the public to the scale of the crisis we are facing.Butthe Government lts some of the restrictions soon and the economy starts to recover , what should the Chancellor do in his Budget in November  Of course we don’t know exactly what the figures will look like and we must wait to see before final judgements.Almost certainly he will be confronting a massively reduced economy, groaning under skyscraping debt, higher unemployment and only a gradual recovery.Horric as the borrowing figures will be it would be a mistake to move quickly to reduce the debt before the recovery is firmly established.He should let borrowing take the strain in the short term. Any measures to rein in the deficit should be for later. In order to boost jobs he might cut National Insurance or make a temporary cut in VAT designed to bring forward spending.Keir Starmer gave a menacing hint of his approach when he said there would have to be “a day of reckoning” and hinted at tax increases on the better off as though they were to blame.That would be precisely the wrong approach. As the economy gets back to maybe  per cent of where it was before the Chancellor needs to do all he can to support business.He has recently given some generous help to new high tech start ups. Well and good, but it will be important to continue to support existing businesses.It should never be forgotten that firms that have failed in this crisis have not failed though any fault of their own. This down turn is not a normal recession caused by market forces, a rise in interest rates or overheating.No this recession and the bankruptcies have been caused by the Government’s measures rightly introduced to contain the virus. So the Government should not feel embarrassed about continuing some of their schemes to support inidual businesses and indeed they have a duty to do so.The Chancellor sets the framework but ultimately growth does not come from Governments, it comes from iniduals and firms. The way to growth and recovery is to give them the freedom and the incentives and the rest will follow.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Raising taxes in the current climate is not something the Government is likely to want to do.But the scale of the economic crisis now gripping the UK means they may end up feeling they have little option.So far the Chancellor has done what he had to do to protect businesses and workers from enforced shutdowns. The cost will have to come from somewhere.It is estimated the furloughing scheme alone will cost at least £billion. At the same time, tax receipts have noseed as earnings have decreased and fewer people are spending in the shops.As a result, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that public- sector borrowing will increase by an eye-watering £billion above the earlier forecast.The black hole in the country’s finances left by Covid- means that at some point, the Chancellor is going to have to face the uncomfortable issue of whether taxes will go up.Any rises must be set against the need to ensure nothing chokes the ­economic recovery, which will be vital.We must also guard against hitting the most hard-up in society. And ­crucially, we need to ensure we don’t make it unprofitable for dynamic small companies to operate.One option for the Chancellor is to target the big multi-nationals and billionaires who use tax havens to avoid paying their fair share.Yet we will also need to have big business on our side as we try to recover, so it is a delicate balancing act.Our priority right now still has to be protecting the vulnerable and health workers from another Covid- outbreak.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.But it is time too for the Government to think seriously about how to restart the economy as quickly as possible.Two days ago came news that Jaguar and Aston Martin will restart production in May. The Chancellor needs to help other companies follow suit.The more successful he is, the likelier he will be able to limit the number of extra taxes he has to raise in the months ahead.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He needs to show he is back in charge.The PM has plans, yet to be announced, for “non-essential” stores to open. Next will be schools. This will be the “new normal”.

It has taken pressure off the NHS. The “sombrero” curve has been flattened.Crucially, we now have spare hospital capacity and, despite a shortage of protective equipment, our NHS frontline has avoided meltdown.Yet we continue to hear the dismal dirge, “Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives”, to the muffled drums of the BBC and its throat-slitting Thought For The Day.While some are breaking those rules, many more — especially the over-s — are too terried to poke their nose outdoors evenit’s safe.So non-Covid hospital wards are empty and countless worried patients are missing le-saving treatment for cancer, kidney or heart disease.Others in lockdown are prone to mental health problems, suicide and fast-rising domestic brutality. More might die because of lockdown than from Covid- itself.The economy, meanwhile, is on le support. The UK “jobs miracle” is merely a memory.

Dirt-poor families in Africa and Asia — reliant on cash sent home by migrant children — are seeing those lelines severed overnight.In America, where Depression-style unemployment is close to million, the revolt against lockdown is already under way.Lockdown is prolonging the worldwide agony. This email from Cambridge post office manager and Sun reader Rob Swt sums up the view of many baffled Sun readers. Rob says: “We allow customers in to match the number serving and everyone has PPE.“At no point has anybody had symptoms or gone absent through coronavirus. We use our common sense then go home to our families before doing it all again the next day.“Along with supermarkets, building sites and some small shops, we have been open throughout and at no point have cases risen to the extent we have had to close down.”If lockdown continues for too long, many of those one- in-four firms which have already stopped trading will not reopen.

Book that appointment today.THE newly recovered Prime Minister has a huge challenge awaiting him today: restoring the public’s waning faith in lockdown.First, he must use his incredible powers of oratory to remind fed-up Brits exactly what’s at stake.Then, he must clear up the confusion that’s crept in since he’s been away. Why, for example, is going for a drive in your sealed car banned, but driving the same distance for a walk allowed If our elected PM explains to us exactly what he wants from us and why, we have no doubt the country will sit up and listen.AMID all the doom and gloom it’s easy to forget all the good news at the moment.A whopping great asteroid will today miss Earth by  million miles.At least we can cross “getting flattened” off the worry list. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet on the other side of the world, South Korea has witnessed nothing like the same devastation.To date, there have been just  deaths in the Asian nation, and only , cases - barely a tenth of the British total.While Britain remains in the grip of the storm, South Korea is already emerging from the darkness.What makes this phenomenal gap all the more remarkable is the country’s closeness to China, the initial global centre of the pandemic - which should have left South Korea - a country of  million people - far more vulnerable than Britain to the ravages of the disease.But the South Korean authorities took this seriously, through their prompt action and ruthless efficiency, they quickly managed to get the virus under control.On  February, there had been  new cases, but this daily figure fell dramatically in the subsequent two months, dropping to single digits last week.Amid all the gloom across the earth, South Korea’s astonishing success is a beacon the world.And its achievement is particularly impressive because the nation has not resorted to Chinese or European-style lockdowns.Most of the population has not been placed under effective house arrest, nor has the economy been put into a medically-induced coma.Under strict rules about social distancing, bars, cafes, shops and hotels have remained open.One British journalist based in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, told me that he even had to queue last week for a table at a restaurant in a fashionable district, something that would be unthinkable in Britain.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers. The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM. No matter how little you can spare, please donate today here: www.thesun whocareswinsappeal.Only a fortnight ago, elections were held for the country’s National Assembly, won overwhelmingly by the ruling Democratic Party.This week, restrictions on churches and gyms will be relaxed.From early May the South Korean football and baseball leagues will resume, though at first in empty venues.So how has South Korea avoided the kind of crisis that has gripped so many western countries, including our own What is the secret of its success  The answer can be found in a national strategy that combines social responsibility with organisational efficiency, governmental foresight, and sophisticated technology.At heart, South Korea has been better prepared than most.That is largely because the nation was badly shaken by the outbreaks of the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS earlier in the century.Criticism of the Government’s mismanagement was especially strong after MERS in , which left  people dead.In the wake of this condemnation, testing capacity for a pandemic was drastically expanded, supplies of personal protective equipmentwere strengthened, hospitals were equipped with infection control units, and plans for nationwide information campaigns were put in place.So when the first Covid- deaths occurred in China in January, the South Korea state was ready to swing into action, guided by the principles of “test, trace and contain.”Immediately, a Coronavirus taskforce ordered the swt development of a practical diagnostic test that could identy people who had been infected.The job was completed with amazing efficiency.Within just a week, a reliable testing kit had been approved and put into production.There followed a huge programme of testing, often at the rate of , a day, carried out through a vast network  centres and  drive-through facilities.By March , while Britain was still struggling, South Korea had tested over , people.From the start, screening was also applied to all arrivals at Korean airports, including national citizens, something our own Government has never attempted until now.This testing regime was backed up by a huge effort both to trace all the contacts of those who test positive for Covid  and to alert the public to the presence of disease carriers.In this drive, South Korea has the advantage that its population has embraced online and mobile technology so eagerly.This is, after all, the land of mobile telecoms giant Samsung and computer colossus LG.Thanks to such sophistication, the movements of the infected can therefore be uncovered through phone records, GPS tracking, financial statements and CCTV images.This data enables the Korean Centre for Disease Control and Prevention to send text messages, in real time, to mobile users, telling them of any cases in their vicinity.The information also means that the contacts of carriers can be advised to take extra precautions or go into self-isolation.It is an ultra-modern approach that reflects South Korea’s culture.“Koreans are super-good at making things convenient for people. We don’t have any patience. South Korea is one of the most wired countries in the world, where everybody uses cell-phones for just about everything and the Government is able to use all our phones not only to track but to send warnings,” said Kee Park, a lecturer in public health at Hard in the USA.Some might argue all this hi-tech testing and tracing represents a worrying descent into the authoritarian world of Big Brother.But the level of intrusion should not be exaggerated.These text alerts do not reveal any inidual’s name and address, only their gender and age category.Moreover, “track and trace” technology is far less draconian that the European lockdowns.Nor is it correct to pretend that South Koreans are more submissive than westerners.In reality, the country has been a stable, pluralist democracy since .The public’s willingness to challenge the Government was graphically highlighted by huge mass protests held from October  to March  against President Park Geun-Hye over allegations of corruption.More than .million people took to the streets, eventually bringing about her impeachment and downfall.Far from being some downtrodden state, South Korea is more advanced than many parts of the west and this has further helped in the fight against the virus.Its health service is so well managed that it was ranked the best in the world in a  global study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .There was never any danger of it being overwhelmed, as our own Government feared might happen to the NHS.Again, in contrast to the centralised bureaucracy of the NHS, the South Korean model is privately run, with  per cent of the population covered by compulsory national health insurance.The same spirit of efficiency can be seen right across the Korean infrastructure.Trains, buses and urban metro systems are renowned for their punctuality.Incheon airport, the country’s largest, was ranked the best in the world for  consecutive years from .A dynamic economy, with high levels of exports, ensures that the South Korean population is affluent and well-educated, with more than  per cent of young people going to university.But this prosperity is accompanied by widespread social responsibility, reflected in the strong work ethic and a lower crime rate than most industrialised nations.Respect for others is also shown in the universal willingness to wear face masks, not so much as a barrier against infection but as a means of preventing the spread of disease.A refusal to don one is seen as a social offence, just as Koreans use hand sanitisers everywhere and do not object to the heat sensors that exist in many office buildings to read their temperatures.It is not unusual for citizens to have their temperatures checked a dozen times a day.The climate of solidarity has helped South Korea come through the worst.Its experience provides a lesson to the rest of the world.As Jerome Kim, the Director of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul puts, it, South Korean contained the virus “through decisive, transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For every Peter Kay, who you want to see, there are three members of The Mash Report team, who you really don’t. There are also corporate sponsors to satisfy and a surprise appearance from Prince William, in a Blackadder spin-off sketch, with Stephen Fry, asking: “Have you seen anything good on TV ” .On the face of it then, it looked impossible to separate the wheat from all that celebrity chaff.In reality, though, it was surprisingly easy, because lockdown TV has already taught us song and dance can still work, even on Skype,the artists are as good as Dave Grohl and the others, who collaborated on Times Like These, or as talented and attractive as the Strictly professionals.Just as obviously, we’ve learned to rely on the internet for laughs this past month, because television comedy isn’t anywhere near funny enough to see us through a crisis. Thursday night wasn’t ever going to change that opinion, but it did highlight a ide.Eventhey were phoning in the performances, there were a group of comedians some viewers will have been excited to see, like Coogan, Brydon, Dawn French, Little Britain etc, who all had careers before . And there were a group of comedians who’ve been forced on us, since then, who aren’t comedians at all. At best, they’re pub-funny show-offs — at worst they’re political propagandists trying to bend us to their will.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.The contrast could not have been better illustrated by the segment where modern Mash Report types and old-school stand-ups were given about ten seconds to make us laugh and the only one who could nail it was Tim Vine, who appeared with a placard reading “Bad” and a punchline: “That’s not a good sign is it.”An actual punchline! On the BBC! It’s one of the many things that’s been missing from the network, for years, though I was glad long-suffering viewers didn’t punish TBNI for past failures. Thursday was hardly the time for mass recriminations.At some point in the future, though, someone has to try to explain to the BBC that we prefer comedians who make us laugh rather than tell us off, andthere was a reason why The Big Night In seemed less wearying and slightly more uplting than the usual Comic Relief slog then, beyond the extraordinary circumstances, it was a very obvious one.It only lasted three hours. Less is more, guys.TV astrologer Russell Grant made this uncanny  prediction, for those of us born in the star sign Cancer, late last year, in the Mirror.“Travel is on the cards in the spring and as much as you enjoy your home le, you will appreciate this change of scene.”Yeah, the Sainsbury’s queue was a blast, thanks Russ.“It’s not just The Big Night In, April  is, of course . . .”A St George’s Day B Shakespeare’s birthday C Darren Huckerby’s birthday It was D “The start of Ramadan.”The clue being in the letters BBC, of course.THE Dave channel has been attempting to ease the nation’s ever-present mental health worries via the gt of laughter.A noble cause and a good idea.Unfortunately, they’ve given the all-important job to some of the worst comedians in Britain.Last week, it was the turn of Nish Kumar, Suzi Ruffell, Seann Walsh and Darren Harriott, whose attempts to end Britain’s silent suffering were ided into two separate and contrasting segments.In the first, backstage, they discussed their own experiences of mental health issues, which sounded more like a lot of really bad hangovers, egotism and self-pity, while making the usual heartfelt pleas for tolerance, understanding and a constructive dialogue.’Cos, you know, they’re alive to the fact they’re meant to care.Then Kumar and Ruffell went out on stage and spewed vile, angry foul-mouthed hatred about Boris, Trump, Top Gear, Richard Hammond , fellow comedians and anyone who’s got what Ruffell calls “lazy opinions”.That is to say, anyone who has the temerity to hold a dferent political opinion to her own.Not a single word of it was funny, let alone healing.Darren Harriott, the least worst of them, though, did at least have the decency to provide the necessary cue.“I struggle to give people all of me ’cos I’m always worried they’re going to go, they’re going to disappear and . . .”Click.He’s got a point, hasn’t he.Paul Merson: “Bournemouth seem to keep coming up without answers.”Micah Richards: “The way he carried his body language was outstanding.”Matt Le Tissier: “Spurs are never going to win the league in a million years.

He’s not the only one on that show, either. There’s strong competition to be the biggest one from Bluto-ish oaf Tony Bellew, the former world cruiserweight boxing champion, who’s got an even shorter fuse than Fashanu.Both have already been called in for fairly urgent “questioning” by the SAS instructors who always hold the whip hand during these interrogations as, at the first hint of vanity, derangement, pretension or self-delusion, Ant Middleton can shout “GUARD!” and Billy bundles them off with a hood over their head.If it was just a hardman staring contest, of course, the show wouldn’t work. But it’s not. Sometimes the Special Forces team are staring at contestants like “YouTuber” Jack Maynard, trying to get their heads around what the hell it is he actually does for a living.“I will come up with some video idea and I direct, film, edit and present the thing myself.”Billy : “So you’re actually a smart f***er.”There are also emerging friendships, hidden tensions, a lot of honest endeavour and a simmering feud between Paralympian Lauren Steadman and Joey Essex, which erupts on next week’s show .SAS: Who Dares Wins will have to proceed, though, without Katie Price, who quit after a feeble two-day effort, and Anthea Turner, who tried getting all philosophical just before she threw in her armband. “I feel I am in what the Japanese call my second spring.”Fetch the hood, Billy.MEANWHILE, over on episode two of I’ll Get This, Jermaine Jenas says to Sara Pascoe: “I’ll be waiting for the comedian in you to come out.”So we’ll check up on him again in November .C’s SAS: Who Dares Wins.

after he was confronted by the son of an NHS worker who died.This morning the Health Secretary was challenged by Intisar Chowdhury, the son of NHS doctor Abdul Mabud Chowdhury who died earlier this month.He urged Mr Hanock to admit his mistakes, and made a desperate plea for more PPE.And this afternoon reporters challenged him to apologise to families of loves ones who have died as the Government didnt protect them.Intisar told Nick Ferrari on LBC this morning: He wrote a request for more PPE to the Prime Minister... that was ignored, two weeks later he passed away, do you regret not taking my dads concerns, my -year-old sisters dads concerns... seriously At least  NHS staff and  social care workers have already died from coronavirus.Mr Hancock expressed his condolences to Intisar, but would not admit mistakes had been made.He said: Im really sorry about your dads death and Ive seen the comments youve made and I think its very brave of you to be speaking out in public.We took very, very seriously what your father said and weve been working around the clock to ensure theres enough protective equipment.Mr Hancock said they looked into each and every case of NHS and social care workers who had died to understand why it had happened and what needed to be improved.And this afternoon he told the No press conference: I think that is unreasonable as a question.From the start we knew there was a very signicant challenge with care homes.Enormous work gone on in Government to monitor this from the start.We are constantly learning from what happens and how we support people across the care sector.The health and social care services have been grappling with problems obtaining enough PPE since the start of the crisis.Despite the Government saying over one billion pieces of PPE have been delivered, there have been continual problems ensuring it gets to the hospitals that need it most.We are backing a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.” SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking our readers to please sign the petition below.According to the Royal College of Physicians, one in four doctors are still having to reuse single-use PPE.When pressed on whether mistakes were made, Mr Hancock said policies had been changed as the Government learnt more about the virus.He said: There are things that weve changed as weve gone through... because weve learned more things about the virus and because things didnt work out as expected.But Intisar was unimpressed with Mr Hancocks answered and pushed him for an apology.He told Mr Hancock: The public is not expecting the Government to handle this perfectly, were not expecting perfection, were expecting progression, were expecting you to admit that mistakes were made, especially to me and people who have really lost loved ones to the virus.Openly acknowledging your mistake is not an admission of guilt, it makes you seem more human.

This could lead to delays which can cause serious health problems, especially for conditions like chlamydia.Tracey Forsyth, lead contraceptive nurse at British Pregnancy Advisory Service, also revealed that women are routinely telling her they are struggling to access sexual health services.She told The Independent: It is very dficult to access contraception, sexual health and have smears at the moment. There were lots of cuts to services before this.We have rolled the clock back with sexual health by decades due to coronavirus and cuts.Ms Forsyth added: Places are worrying we will have a massive STI problem at the end of Covid-.Most people dont experience any symptoms, and dont realise they are infected.Symptoms can include pain or a burning sensation during sex, and an unusual discharge.Women might also experience pain in the lower abdomen during or after sex, and bleeding after sex.In men, chlamydia can also cause a pain or tenderness in the testicles.. HPVHuman papilloma virus , which causes genital warts, is the second most common STI here in Britain.The warts are usually painful, but may be itchy or red. Occasionally, they cause bleeding.HPV is spread by skin-to-skin contact, so you can catch it evenyou havent had penetrative sex - and condoms DONT provide complete protection.. GonorrhoeaGonorrhoea is a bacterial STI - which often has no symptoms.Symptoms include pain or a burning sensation during sex, and an unusual discharge.Less common symptoms in women include pain in the lower gut and bleeding between periods or after sex.In men, gonorrhoea can cause swelling in the foreskin and, in rare cases, pain in the testicles.. HerpesGenital herpes in a common infection caused by HSV virus, which also causes cold sores.The symptoms can develop a few days after contact and include small, painful blisters which itch or tingle - and can make it dficult to urinate.. SyphillisSyphilis is bacterial infection which causes painless - but highly infectious - sores on the genitals and around the mouth.Symptoms for the second stage of syphilis include a rash, flu-like illness and patchy hair loss - which will last for a few weeks.In the third stage, which occurs after several years, people with syphilis may experience heart problems, paralysis and blindness.Ms Forsyth, whose contraceptive team speaks to around  women a week via the phone, said disruption to STI treatment is a problem for both men and women and was a “timely public health issue”.People who have chlamydia and gonorrhoea, and the people they have had sex with, need to be treated, she added.And Ms Forsyth warned that the cuts to sexual health services could have an even more detrimental effect on womens health - with chlamydia having a longer-term risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause infertility.On top of this, women are concerned about not being able to get smear tests, which help to pick up early signs of cell changes in the cervix that can turn into cancer.Kate Sanger, the spokesperson for charity Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said the guidance from NHS England is to try to continue providing cervical screenings.But we know in some parts of the country, they have stopped sending out invitations for screenings or postponed them for the foreseeable future, she added.Provision is patchy. While there are some women who will want to go, some won’t be able to go because they are self-isolating.Sexual health charities urged the Government to tackle the rising number of STIs in the UK ahead of the coronavirus outbreak.A report by the Terrence Higgins Trust and British Association for Sexual Health  HIVreleased in February drew attention to the “unacceptably high” STI rates with a diagnosis every  seconds on average.In , there were , new diagnoses of STIs, which is an increase of five per cent from the year before.Despite this, Dr John McSorley, BASHH President, says they have seen a reduction in sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in clinics in the past month during lockdown.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

Cases of syphilis are at levels not seen since World War Two. It is important that the Government fully supports ongoing open access to excellent sexual health services for everyone in the UK as we inch our way back towards normality.A happy healthy and fulfilling sex le is a really important cheap and cheerful way of putting a smile back on everyone’s face as summer approaches.If you think you may have an STI, the most important thing is to get tested and get medical advice quickly so you can start treatment.Doctors say you should call your GP or sexual health clinic - or the NHS says self-test kits for STIs are available online.If youre buying a self-test kit online, its important to be wary of the claims they make, as they may be misleading.Before using one, make sure the kit is sealed, without any damage to the packaging, and is within its expiry date.Check that the instructions for use are clear and easy to follow.You should also make sure it has a CE quality assurance mark - this means that, provided you use it correctly, the kit will work properly and is safe.If you think you need to see a doctor in an emergency, AE departments are still open, and doctors are urging people not to avoid seeking help in an emergency due to coronavirus fears.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The UK Government position hasnt changed.Not least because the most important thing people can do is the social distancing, as opposed to the weak science on face masks.And Angela McClean, the Chief Scientic Adviser for the Ministry of Defence, added: The recommendation from SAGE is completely clear, there is weak evidence of a small effect that a face masks can prevent a source of infection from somebody who is infected to the people around them.It comes after The Sun revealed last week that SAGEwas set to recommend Brits wear face masks in public places where people cant stay m apart.Ministers are still studying the findings and deciding whether to change advice across the whole of the UK.Downing Street insist that the UK-wide decision on masks had yet to be made, but hasnt said when it will be.A spokesperson said: SAGE’s review has been sent to ministers who are considering the advice that they have been given.Once a decision has been reached we will announce it publicly.Its believed that the decision may come alongside other tweaks to lockdown guidance.Former Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King told Sky News earlier: If I were moving to control the spread of the epidemic, I would wish to see everyone outdoors, in particular going shopping, wearing a face mask.But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.

All kinds of things:  teeth, childrens toys, a stash of stolen car radios — you name it.Wet wipes have been the biggest culprit in creating fatbergs, as  per cent contain plastic which causes major blockages.Northumbrian Water found that last year, wet wipes were the cause of nearly two thirds of the , blockages in the sewers.These often occurred in the sewer pipes of households, rather than further down in the system.And Wessex Water has warned people not to flush kitchen roll and wet wipes down the loo.It costs the water company a whopping £ million a year to resolve the , blockages a year.A spokesman told Somerset Live: Our simple message isyou are using these items, please put them in the bin, rather than flushing them.They are designed to stay intact, unlike toilet paper which can break down in the sewers.The problem has been particularly bad in Australia, where waste water spills of up to , litres have been caused by sewage blockages, requiring an expensive clean up.These will cost Aussie customers . million a year.GOT a story  Ring The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or email exclusive@the-sun.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

last week, chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the evidence on face masks has always been quite iable, quite weak and dficult to know.Yesterday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of the hospitals group NHS providers, told The Times he fears members of the public will rush to buy medical-grade masks, which are much needed by frontline medics.He said: There is bound to be a question in some peoples minds about what form of face covering provides the greatest protection.The scientic evidence is clear - the fluid repellent surgical masks worn by healthcare workers offer greater protection because of the signicantly smaller pore sizes in the material they use.It therefore seems likely that some people will try to purchase these masks.This is why its vital that the threat to this supply is carefully assessed before the government makes decisions.Coronavirus deaths have jumped to more than , in hospitals after  more people died.Positive cases have also risen by , to , as Britain grapples with week six of drastic lockdown measures.But it is understood that when deaths outside hospitals are counted, the true toll will be more than ,.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day -

It comes as scientists claim coronavirus is unlikely to be eradicated and mayeach year like seasonal flu.The Chinese expertsapos predictions echo what the UKaposs chief medical officer, professor Chris Whitty chillingly warned last week. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE. Professor Whitty said the country is unlikely toto normal, until a vaccine can be found, as it has for the flu. The Chinese viral and medical researchers told reporters in Beijing that the virus is not likely to disappear like SARS, because it can infect carriers who have no idea they have symptoms and are passing on silently to others. They said Chinese health officials are still confirming dozens of asymptomatic carriers every day. Mr Miliband praised the UK Government for its attempt to start an international discussion on vaccination, but said “the main donor countries to the global aid effort have been pretty myopic about the crisis at the moment”.  The IRC works with survivors of conflict and disaster in  countries. Mr Miliband also warned that while the coronavirus “tsunami” had yet to hit many of the countries where his organisation worked, it could become “rampant” before too long. IRC research based on modelling from Imperial College London and the World Health Organisation estimates that between  million and one billion people will become infected, and between .m and  million people could die.The underlying health vulnerabilities mean that this is going to hit and it’s not going to be stopped until it’s gone really widespread, the former Labour politician continued. We’ve got maybe four weeks to do vital preventative work. Commenting on the Scottish Government’s decision to recommend the wearing of facemasks in enclosed public spaces where social distancing was dficult, Mr Miliband said “it must be a good thing”. “To the extent that it helps at all it must be a good thing. Andyou’ve been to Japan in the last ten years, it’s the norm, he said. So I think it’s going to become the norm. Asked about the UK Government’s response to the pandemic so far, Mr Miliband said he was “worried”. “I’m worried about the testing. I’m obviously relived at the way the NHS has pulled through and people have pulled together. “And Iaposm worried that thereaposs almost a feeling that the debate about the lockdown is an on-off switch and it isnapost.” Mr Miliband added that he felt there was no going back to the way things were. “Thereaposs no going back to the old normal. Thereaposs going to be a new normal, and that trust between the government and people is so important to making this work.” Mr Miliband also told the Coronavirus Newscast that his family had a run-in with their new neighbours.

George Eustice said people should not be penalised for bringing waste to a dump or recycling centre - which the government has told to reopen in the coming weeks. Government guidance says people should only leave the house for four reasons - shopping for basic necessities, one form of exercise a day, a medical need, or travelling for work purposes. Going to a tip or recycling centre does not feature either in the list of exemptions in the law, or a guide on essential travel from the College of Policing. But ministers are worried fly-tipping has soared, with the Countryside Alliance warning it has risen % in some areas. The Environment Secretary told LBC: We think that it would be essential travel to dispose of waste. We’ve had a problem with fly-tipping because local authorities in some cases took the decision to close those recycling centres. Calling for tips to reopen he added: We think they are a necessary service. We claried guidance on that now in case there was any doubt about that. Many household waste recycling centres closed after government guidance on April  said they only had to stay openpossible. The guidance on prioritising which services to keep open said they were of medium importance. It added: If it is possible to keep HWRCs open, make sure that social distancing rules can be maintained. Always provide adequate staffing levels for health and safety and security purposes. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said yesterday the guidance would be amended. He told MPs councils should draw up a plan to reopen in the coming weeks. He added: Public Health England has published guidance for those working in the sector, recommending that where the  metre distance rule cannot be adhered to, staff should make sure that the windows of their vehicles are open for ventilation, and they should wash their hands for  seconds or longer before getting in and out of the vehicle, or use hand sanitiser where handwashing is not possible. We will ensure that councils follow up and adhere to that advice so that those key workers are properly protected as they go about their work.

But in a graphic newly produced for today’s daily coronavirus briefing, the wording had been changed. It now reads: “Confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.” It raised questions over whether a second peak of infections may now be acceptable as long as the NHS wasn’t swamped with new patients.  But Number  denied the tests were being relaxed, insisting the wording had simply been revised to more closely match those used by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on April .Mr Raab had said: “Fth, and this is really crucial, we need to be confident that any adjustments to the current measures will not risk a second peak of infections that overwhelm the NHS.”These tests were first outlined  days ago by  Mr Raab, the Prime Ministeraposs stand-in while he was sick.Only once the UK has fulfilled these tests will some of the lockdown measures - though not all - be relaxed.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was still too early to say when schools might reopen and the lockdown might be eased. There are still too many deaths each day and the five tests that we set out havenapost been met. I know, especially as a father of three young children, that thereaposs a yearning from people to know when schools might go back and, of course, itaposs something that we think about and we talk about.

Michael Gove revealed that a domestic effort has been launched to slow the spread of coronavirus by producing masks that limit the droplets that each of us might be responsible for.His commitment comes after Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gazumped the UK government in advising Scots to wear masks. She told her daily briefing that coverings should be worn in enclosed spaces, such as shops or on public transport. It is thought that her advice is likely to become UK-wide guidance in the coming days, although the government in Westminster has so far stopped short of it, referring to the science behind their effectiveness as weak. Thereports that the government wants to delay an announcement on face coverings until it has stockpiled enough.The government yesterday said it is carefully reviewing the advise of its SAGE scientic committee and will make public any changes in policy.In a Commons exchange with his Labour shadow Rachel Reeves, Mr Gove said: “I can confirm Lord Agnew, the joint Cabinet Office and Treasury minister, has launched a domestic effort to ensure we produce just such masks and that is part of the broader effort that Lord Deighton is leading on ensuring we can bolster the production of personal protection equipment.” Ms Sturgeon said that while the evidence was limited, wearing face coverings could help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus by those people who are not yet showing symptoms. We are recommending that you do wear a cloth face coveringyou are in an enclosed space with others where social distancing is dficult, for example public transport or in a shop, she told her daily briefing. Let me emphasize the key point here which is that you should not really be in situations very often like that right now,you are complying with the stay-at-home rules. But Downing St insisted that a change to the rules in the UK was not imminent. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: SAGEaposs review has been sent to ministers who are reviewing it carefully. Once a decision has been reached we will announce it publically. Ministers are considering the advice and once we reach a decision we will say so.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock set out plans for easier, faster and simpler testing so more people can access a Covid- test to tellthey currently have the virus. Wider testing will be essential before the government can ease up on the UK lockdown - because itaposll show whether the virus is running rampant again. Mr Hancock has claimed he is on track to hit the target of , tests a day by April , despite needing to double them within days. Because capacity has now increased so substantially, we are now able to expand who can get the tests, he said.Our ultimate goal is that everyone who could benefit from a test gets a test. Mr Hancock said: Itaposs all part of getting Britain back on her feet. But you may have to drive for a -minute round trip to get a test and there could be heavy demand on new kits to be posted to your home. Hereaposs who is eligible and how the system will work. Who is eligible for a test  As the UK extends its testing capacity a growing list of people are eligible to be tested:All those working on the frontline in health and social carePatients in the NHS and residents in care homesAll other aposessentialapos workers- see full list below Anyone over Anyone who goes into work because they cannot work from home, for example construction workersAnyone who has symptoms and lives with someone who meets any of the above criteriaIn the UK there are around million people classed as essential workers but their households will also be eligible under the scheme. But who is essential  It it the same list of occupations used by the government to determine whether or not you can continue to send your children to school during lockdown. Key workers on the list are the same as those for access to schools, and include NHS and social care workers, police officers, teachers, social workers, those in the justice system, undertakers, some in local government, supermarket and food production workers, journalists, transport workers and some people in utilities and IT. A full list is below or on this web page. How sick do you have to be   You need to show symptoms in order to be tested, unless you work in a care home of for the NHS. The main two are a new and persistent dry cough and a temperature. But other people who have tested positive for covid- include losing taste and a sense of smell.    It will showyou currently have Covid-. This is useful to proveyour symptoms are actually the virus. It does not showyouaposve had Covid- in the past. It will help people work out when they and their household members canto work safely. Where do I log on to book a test  Visit the governmentaposs web page. Slots for testing tend to appear at am and can be snapped up quickly. Where do I go to get tested     The first port of call is a drive-through testing centre - with  promised by the end of April. The government expects you to be able to drive for up to  minutes from your home to get to a drive-through site, leaving some with potentially a -minute round trip. WhatI canapost drive   For those who donapost live near enough to a testing site or canapost drive there are other options. The government has pledged that Royal Mail and Amazon will deliver home testing kits. The availability of these was limited at first, with , selling out within two minutes on the first day. It was later upped to , a day and officials hoped for it to scale up to , a day by the end of April. What about other ways of getting tested  Meanwhile apossatelliteapos test kits are also being sent directly to care homes to enable residents with symptoms to be tested. And the Army is helping set up mobile testing units which will travel the country to places like care homes, police stations and prisons. Itaposs not clear how these will help workers without a mobile unit or satellite kit at their place of work. However, as of April  they were in Torquay, Hereford, Boston, Salisbury, Bishop Auckland, Barnet, Northampton, Grimsby, Skegness, Blackpool, Macclesfield, Ramsgate, Harwich, Barnsley, Grantham and Kendal. How long will I wait for results     Test results from the drive-through sites will be sent out by text within  hours, the government says. For home delivery tests, the waiting time is  hours after the sample has been sent off. Itaposs not clear how quickly a test will be booked in once youaposve asked for it - presumably it depends on demand. Why are essential workers getting tested  The aim is simple - to ensure they can get back to work. Because the test showsyou currently have Covid-, it also can given an indication that your cough is just a  alarm. So people whoaposve been self-isolating to protect others due to a mild cough can get back on the front line. Whataposs it like getting the test   The test involves taking a swab  of the nose and throat - and it goes back pretty far, so be prepared. A single swab is used to collect a liquid sample from the back of your throat and your nose. This swab is then placed into a sample tube and securely packaged, where it is sent to the lab for testing. Depending on where you get tested, you will either have a clinician take your swab or be asked to do it yourself.

But with other European countries beginning to relax their rules, calls are growing for the government to spell out how it will eventually be relaxed. Tory MPs have piled on pressure to save the economy - while Scotland and Wales have tightened the screws by pushing ahead and saying what will happen next. For all the argument and debate, we still donapost have a date when lockdown will be relaxed. And we know it wonapost actually end - it will just be eased bit by bit. But we have ious clues and leaked details which point to how that might happen. Weaposll relax lockdown once the infection rate is low enough, and then use a test, trace, track strategy with an NHS app to keep it low. Hereaposs everything we know about how lockdown will be relaxed, but why we must also get used to a aposnew normalapos that looks dferent to the UK we knew before.How long is the UKaposs coronavirus lockdown  The lockdown expires on May  - six weeks after it began. But thataposs just the legal date it has to be reviewed by. Emergency lockdown powers in the Health Protection Regulations  must be formally reviewed every three weeks. In reality the government will renew the lockdown for longer, at least partly. The question is how much of it will be extended, and for how long.  When will the UK lockdown end - and how  The UK lockdown will start to be relaxed once five tests are met:The NHS is able to cope A sustained fall in deaths New infections dropping enough Adequate testing and PPE No risk of a second peakBut once it is eased it wonapost all happen in one go. Instead the lockdown is set to be relaxed in phases while some social distancing measures stay in place. So while the strictest restrictions should start to ease this summer, some measures look set to be in place until next year. Stand-in PM Dominic Raab adds we might see restrictions tighten in some ways and loosen in others. How will the government decide itaposs time to relax the lockdown  The UK government will have to fulfil all five testson ending the lockdown. Downing Street adds the key test will be how far and fast the infection rate drops. aposRapos - the number of people each carrier infects - is already below , which stops Covid- spreading exponentially. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock has warned it wouldn’t take much to lose that grip. Any change to the restrictions must not risk the aposRapos number going above .So how will we know when thataposs happened  The key piece of evidence will be a study by the Office for National Statistics on the infection rate - expected to be published in early May. That could be crucial in deciding what the government does next. Despite pleas from Tory MPs, Downing Street insists the decision will be based on science before the economy. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: We will have to take decisions based on the best available scientic and health advice. it’s not going to be a case of choosing between the economy and public health.”Will lockdown be relaxed before May   Government sources said there would likely be more details spelt out before May . But officials later insisted that wouldnapost actually mean a clear exit plan - it more means an update on the infection rate. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: Weaposve set out that we will review social distancing measures by May . The Government is focused upon that date. Once lockdown is relaxed, what happens then  If the virus spikes again, lockdown could have tomultiple times with little notice. So the plan is to stop that happening with a three pronged strategy - test, trace and track. The government is hiring , human contact tracers and will encourage people to download an NHS app. Put together, the system should noty people when theyaposve been in contact with a Covid- carrier - so they can immediately isolate and stop it spreading further. But there are concerns about how well it will work. The NHS says the app will be launched in the coming weeks. It will use Bluetooth to log each time your phone moves near another personaposs phone with the app. If one of those people is later diagnosed with Covid-, you would get an alert warning you to get tested and self-isolated.  What will reopen first and what will stay shut  The UK government has refused to say officially - and thereaposs not yet a firm decision. But plenty of speculation has been leaked. And we can also pick up clues from Scotland and Wales, which have been more open about their plans. Schools and some non-essential shops seem very likely to reopen first, with modied layouts to ensure people can stay two metres apart. But hairdressers and nail bars could remain shut for six months, sources told The Sun. Working from home could become the new normal until thereaposs a vaccine, government advisors have said. And UK and Scottish ministers have warned pubs and mass gatherings could be among the last to reopen. PM Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: There will be judgments based on scientic and health advice of what is possible without increasing the risk of a second peak.” That could have to mean extending the aposfurloughapos scheme for staff to get up to % of their pay while out of work. The scheme currently expires in June but No will continue to keep it under review. It’s our intention to stand by both workers and businesses, a spokesman said.  Will some people be let out earlier than others  Itaposs possible. The government has looked at an idea of loosening restrictions on younger, healthier people first in order to get the economy moving again. And people could meet small bubbles of wider friends and family under one idea being looked at in Scotland. If that idea does happen, youaposd have to pick the same small aposbubbleapos of people to meet day-to-day, week-to-week - and carry on staying away from everyone . None of you would be able to go outside your aposbubbleapos.  Will people have to wear face masks  Itaposs not clear yet. Ministers are considering how to act on advice from the governmentaposs scientic advisors SAGE. The group decided there is weak evidence of a small effect in which a face mask can prevent someone whoaposs already infected, infecting those around them. Scotland has advised its residents to wear face coverings, either a mask or improvised facial shield such as a scarf, in limited circumstances in public when they have to be in close quarters with others. This is not mandatory. Why have Scotland and Wales got dferent plans - and what does it mean  Deep splits have opened up in the strategy across the UK. Wales and Scotland are both pushing ahead with telling the public what post-lockdown might look like, but the UK government refuses to say. So far, the actual plans remain pretty similar in each country - in fact, Matt Hancock has said Scotlandaposs plan is pretty similar to what heaposs been looking at. Itaposs just the communication with the public that has been split. But that risks changing as Wales and Scotlandaposs chiefs - who sit on crucial COBRA meetings about the lockdown - pile pressure on Boris Johnson and have powers over places like schools and care homes. The split forced the Health Secretary to plead for unity, saying: So far we have moved as one United Kingdom and I think that has been a very good thing. My preference is that we work together as one country. A Downing Street spokesman warned the nations: I’m sure they like us will be guided by the science - and won’t want to do anything that could risk a second peak”. Whataposs happening in Scotland  Scotlandaposs First Minister set out a -page blueprint for easing the lockdown. Nicola Sturgeon said businesses might be able to reopenthey can keep customers and staff  metres apart. The same would have to be in place in schools with modications needed in some classrooms. But pubs and mass gatherings would likely have to remain closed for longer. Despite spelling out an exit strategy, Ms Sturgeon warned normal as we knew it is not on the cards in the near future. Nicola Sturgeon said lting the lockdown is not a flick of the switch moment but more of a gradual change to the current conditions. No insisted Scotlandaposs plan was actually pretty similar to its own in terms of what needs to happen before lockdown ends.  Whataposs happening in Wales  Walesapos First Minister Mark Drakeford said lockdown could be left in three phases, like a traffic light in reverse. The red phase would see only the most careful and controlled lting of restrictions, amber would see more restrictions lted andthe virus does not re-emerge, Wales could move to the green zone. But he believed that UK ministers were nervous about entering into a similar conversation with the public for fear it would undermine the message to stay at home. The Welsh Government will also need seven questions to be answered before easing the lockdown. They are:Would easing a restriction have a negative effect on containing the virus  Does a particular measure pose a low risk of further infection  How can it be monitored and enforced  Can it be reversed quicklyit creates unintended consequences  Does it have a positive economic benefit  Does it have a positive impact on people’s wellbeing  Does it have a positive impact on equality "},{"url":null,"title":"5 physical symptoms anxiety can","story":"NewsThese  physical symptoms of anxiety can easily be mistaken for coronavirusWith the coronavirus UK death toll now exceeding ,, its understood anxiety is also on the rise but doctors are trying to help people copeShareCommentsByBradley JollyDigital journalist:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-facemask-help-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news -physical-symptoms-anxiety-can-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

With the death toll of those with Covid- on the sharp rise again in the UK today, doctors say it is unsurprisingwe feel particularly anxious at the moment.But some symptoms of anxiety are physical ones, unlike psychological symptoms which largely affect our mind. Tightness in the chest and shortness of breath are telltale signs of anxiety - but can also be symptoms of coronavirus. Dr Sarah Jarvis, clinical director of Patientaccess, said: Some of the symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks – feeling short of breath, palpitations, dizziness etc – are sometimes also seen in coronavirus. The doctor, though, suggested ways to tell that itaposs definitely anxiety and not coronavirus. . Shortness of breath Dr Jarvis said people take a few minutes to check in with themselves and try to steady their breathing. The symptoms of panic attacks tend to settleyou concentrate on your breathing and take very slow breaths, she added. Try tummy breathing - put one hand on your chest and the other on your tummy. You should aim to breathe quietly by moving your tummy with your chest moving very little. If you were able to calm yourself down and find a steady breathing pattern within those few minutes, you may not be dealing with coronavirus. But the World Health Organisationsaysyou have coronavirus your chest may begin to feel tight or you begin to feel as though you cannot breathe deeply enough to get a good breath. Shortness of breath associated with the Covid- infection is progressive in nature and can become le-threatening over a period of hours to days without medical care. - - - - - - - - ,- - ,+ - ,  . Problems with digestion Stomach pains, constipation and diarrhoea are signs of anxiety, doctors say. This is largely because the communication system between your brain and the enteric nervous system, which governs your digestion, is affected by stress. Of course, eating foods that don’t agree with you or not exercising can affect your digestion too. However, researchers recently studied data from  patients with Covid- in China’s Hubei province and discovered that . per cent of these patients arrived at the hospital with digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting or abdominal pain. These symptoms, though, were usually accompanied by more typical signs such as a dry cough and high temperature. Therefore,you are only experiencing digestive issues it is unlikely to be coronavirus.  . Increased heart rate An increased heart rate is a classic sign of anxiety, according to the National Institute of Mental Health . Adrenal glands churn out hormones when you are faced when something stressful. So, receptors in your heart react by speeding up your heartbeat as a result. This lets you to pump more blood to your big muscles so you could theoretically flee or combat a threat. However, a racing heart rate can also signal coronavirus, doctors suggest. Dr As Munaf, an NHS consultant, said an elevated heart and breathing rates could indicate “you’ve potentially got signs of an infection, which in this climate could be Covid-”. If itaposs an anxiety attack, your heart rate should settleyou concentrate on your breathing and take very slow breaths. However,itaposs coronavirus your heart rate is likely to remain fast - especially during any form of exercise or movement.  . Muscle pain Your muscles tense up as part of your stress responseyou are suffering from anxiety. Many people with anxiety report feeling tight in their neck, back, or shoulders. But, likewise, some coronavirus patients report muscle soreness across their body. According to WHO, about  per cent of all Covid- patients experienced body aches or joint pain. These aches are triggered by chemicals called cytokines - which the body releases while responding to the infection. Muscle pains in coronavirus patients, though, are usually accompanied by other more well-known symptoms. If you are worried about your symptoms, you can ring  for the NHSapos dedicated service. To protect others, do not go to places like a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.

The brave couple, from Sutton Coldfield, have made the decision to deliver their baby on May  in the hope Jamie can have the chance to meet and cuddle his newborn. Best friend Phil Taylor said: Jamie will never be able to celebrate his baby’s first birthday, teach them to ride a bike and learn to swim or be there for their first day at school. These are the things we take for granted.  Asle isn’t cruel enough, Beccy may have to face childbirth without Jamie, as his health is deteriorating every day. Phil, who met Jamie  years ago, and friend Chad Duggan have launched a crowdfunding page in a bid to raise £, to support Jamieaposs care, his family and Baby Hunter.

He has managed two under-sevens teams right through to under-s and onto adult teams. Jamie is also a huge Manchester United fan with a massive heart, who has dedicated his le to football and teaching.He added: Heaposs godfather to my daughter and my best friend. I know the money we raise isnapost going to keep him here. If it could, Iaposd give it all back. But I thought we should do whatever we can to support Beccy and the baby. Jamie, who works as a PE teacher at John Wilmott School in Sutton Coldfield, joined Sutton United as a teenager and ed as a manager and coach after deciding to stop playing in .  Phil said: He has taken teams from six and seven years of age all the way through to adult football. Jamie loved this so much he did it twice!

The kids love him at school, heaposs always helping kids. Alongside his amazing coaching efforts he also played for the clubaposs first team.

West Yorkshire Police said  offences have now been recorded by the force where an officer or other police staff member has been coughed or spat at and the suspect has stated they are infected with coronavirus. Of these,  involved police officers and the remaining three were against detention officers. Deputy Chief Constable Russ Foster said the publicaposs response to the lockdown has largely been fantastic, with tremendous examples of community spirit and outpourings of support for the NHS and other carers.  But he said: The actions of a few, though, are disgraceful and I will continue to push for them to be charged and brought before the courts at every opportunity. Mr Foster said: At a time when the country is in lockdown, West Yorkshire Police officers and staff put themselves at risk on a daily basis to reassure our communities and keep them safe. Assaults on officers and staff are wholly unacceptable at any time and I hope the courts acknowledge the severity of these peopleaposs actions in sentencing them.  Mr Foster said: Policing is a dficult enough job at the moment and officers and staff worry whether they might pick up the virus and may be taking it home to their loved ones. While we are taking whatever precautions we can, these attacks clearly heighten the risk and cause increased distress. He said there had been marked increase in assault on police in the last two weeks with half of this involving Covid- assaults.  The force said that, of the  offences recorded,  are still under investigation,  have resulted in charges or a summons and three were not progressed to charging due to evidential dficulties. Of those that have been finalised at court, five people have been sentenced to  weeks imprisonment each, two have been jailed for  and  weeks respectively and two were given suspended sentences, it said. At the end of March the director of Public Prosecutions in England Wales warned that anyone who coughs on key workers as a threat amid the coronavirus crisis will face serious criminal charges.

Martin Addy, emeritus professor of dentistry at the University of Bristol, said toothpaste can reduce the chances of catching or spreading the disease through the mouth. However, he warned that the antimicrobial effect of toothpaste only lasts from three to five hours. He therefore suggested Brits brush their teeth before going outside to ensure the effect is active should they come into contact with other people. In a letter in yesterdayaposs Times, Mr Addy, wrote: Scientists, in support of mouth and nasal coverings, have emphasised the role of saliva droplets in the spread of Covid-. Follow our live blog for the latest updates about coronavirus It is perhaps surprising, therefore, that toothbrushing with toothpaste has not been emphasised as an effective procedure.Toothpaste contains the same detergents as those found in handwash gels recommended against coronavirus.Indeed, the antimicrobial action of toothpaste in the mouth persists for three to five hours and, thereby, would reduce the viral load in saliva or infection by viruses entering the mouth. Mr Addy said people wanting to maximise the preventative effects could brush their teeth just before leaving the house. He added: As a large proportion of our population is in lockdown, one of the brushings could be immediately before leaving home for exercise, shopping etc. For those workers in the NHS, brushing should be before putting on protective equipment.

And minutes later, Sian found her daughter wandering around their home in Hawarden, north Wales, with clumps of long, blonde locks falling from her head. My daughter is absolutely doggy obsessed and she loves to help me but the dogs didn’t enjoy her brushing them so I gave her a bowl of treats to feed to the dogs to distract them while I brushed, Mrs Coombs said today. She was doing a great job and by feeding the treats to the puppies, she kept them distracted and it kept her entertained too - so all was going well. I just assumed she’d gone to join her other siblings watching TV or something. But she ed moments later holding the dog clippers in her hand, and as soon as I spotted her holding them, I leapt to get them off her but then noticed what she had done. Mrs Coombs , who is also mum to Thomas , Amara , Henry seven, and five-year-old Percy, panicked as she realised Sariah managed to shave a whole patch down the middle of her head.  She said: The hair was still sort of stuck to her head, but as I began touching it, clumps came away in my hand and I could see what had happened. Sariah’s first reaction was to say mummy did it as Sian was left standing with clumps of her daughter’s hair in her hands. Despite her initial reaction being gobsmacked, Sian said in hindsight she is relieved her toddler didnapost take the clippers to one of the dogs as they have a litter of seven-week-old puppies in the house.  She said: My first instinct was of course one of horror, but I saw the big smile on her face change into an anxious expression when she saw my face so I quickly realised I needed to hide my own feelings to protect her. She’s still breastfed so immediately upon realising there was a problem she asked for ‘bobos’ so I just fed her to calm her down, and give me time to gather my thoughts a little. I didn’t show her the result of her hair until a little while later but she just laughed when she saw herself in the mirror which I was relieved about.  Describing her little one as absolutely full of le, Sian said her cheeky little girl is into everything at the moment. She said: She copies me with every task I do and she’s very bright. I don’t think there’s much in my house that she doesn’t know where it belongs or how it works. She notices everything and just loves to join in and help out. Just days earlier, Mrs Coombs said she had spotted Sariah checking all of the puppies with a stethoscope - so she is glad she didn’t decide to give them all a haircut. The mother said it was also heartwarming to see how none of the other children seemed to mind about their youngest sibling’s new hair-do.  Mrs Coombs added: My children didn’t say much to be honest. They don’t really care what her hair is like, they just love her for who she is regardless of anything . They all immediately went out onto the trampoline and played together like nothing had happened. My eldest was probably the most shocked, my teenage daughter just thought it was funny and the younger boys have barely mentioned it. However, Mrs Coombs admitted that her husband, Paul, did questionshe was joking when she messaged him to tell him the news. She said: He feels the same as me. We just love her to bits and want her to be happy, nothing  matters. These things happen in le sometimes.  Sian said she considered shaving off the rest of Sariah’s hair, but has decided to leave it after reaching out for some advice. She added: I messaged my hairdresser and a few hairdresser friends who all told me to leave it be. I also asked Sariah and she got upset at the thought of having the rest shaved. My only concern now is to protect her feelings. She doesn’t want it cutting so I won’t. I just want her to feel happy and not worry about it so we’re not making an issue of it.

Although not confirmed in all cases, the symptoms are similar to Kawasaki disease, of which there has been an increase in cases in countries dealing with bad Covid- outbreaks. On Monday, doctors were issued an alert about a sharp rise of infants being admitted to intensive care with a Kawasaki-like disease in Britain and Italy. The illness is generally more common in parts of Asia. Kawasaki disease primarily affects children under five years of age, with symptoms including a rash swollen glands in the neck dry, cracked lips red fingers or toes and red eyes.

Right now, weaposre at the very beginning of trying to understand what that represents, Columbiaaposs Dr Mark Gorelik told Reuters. Dr Gorelik said he believes the cases are likely not Kawasaki disease, but a similar process that shares an underlying mechanism with Kawasaki, which is thought to be triggered by an infectious agent that sparks an immune response. The three New York cases follow a report at Stanford University in Calornia, in which a -month-old was admitted to the hospital with Kawasaki disease and was later diagnosed with Covid-.

Doctors were initially baffled by the boyaposs symptoms after the tot developed a fever and rash across his body. But a senior consultant eventually diagnosed the boy with the rare Kawasaki disease, a form of toxic shock syndrome which causes the body’s immune system to attack its own organs. Gemma told Mail Online: I asked for him to be tested, as I had a gut feeling that there was a connection between COVID- and Kawasaki. Both attack your immune system and the whole family had been poorly with Covid symptoms before he fell ill. I was adamant that there was a link and was begging for a test, but they just told me that there was no need to test the under-fives. The brave lad was given an immunoglobin transfusion and was in hospital for five days.

The global coronavirus pandemic is not just affecting people’s physical health. The anxiety, stress and uncertainty of it – and the sweeping changes we’re having to make to our lestyles – are also having an impact on people’s mental health too. If it’s making you feel that way, then you’re not alone. It’s quite normal to feel this way in such a dficult and unpredictable situation. Here are some tips and strategies recommended by our BACP members to help you cope with the mental health impacts of the current global situation. Keep a routine Many people are working from home for the first time in their lives, and some will now be juggling a full-time job and home-schooling their children. Plus, there are people whose usual activities have been curtailed by self-isolation. Our member Vasia Toxavidi says keeping a routine can be really important. “Without a routine, negative thinking and anxiety can escalate. I would suggest that people create a day to day plan of things they will need to do e.g. create a morning exercise programme, work from homepossible, cook something dferent, get into an online course.” Think about restricting access to news media and social media Many of our members recommend having a think about how and when you access the news or social media. This may involve choosing news sources you trust – and avoiding social media channels filled with speculation. Stick to the official government guidance and NHS advice websites. Or limit your access to the news to a certain time of the day. “Some people can be quite paralysed by this anxiety and may want to completely stop interacting with the news,” says Elizabeth Turp.  Keep connected with friends and family In our new world of self-isolation and social distancing, we can’t meet up with family and friends like we used to. But keeping connected to them is vital. Melani Halacre recommends “connecting online with friends and talking about other stuff, inventing new fun ways to connect. An online pub quiz among friends...learn a dance routine at home then share it  Play games online  Cook the same recipe in your own home whilst online ” Be present Emma Brand recommends ‘being present.’ “Take a breath and really experience where you are and how you are feeling. To take in your surroundings and thank the space environment and people in your space - to actively be grateful is very powerful,” she says. Practise gratitude Hansa Pankhania also recommends being grateful for what you have, instead of what you do not. And Natasha Page recommends keeping a gratitude diary, where you write down three things you are grateful for every day. She adds: These can be small things such as the sun shining, hearing your child laugh, a home-cooked meal, a cosy bed. Think about what are the things you do have and are grateful for. Try some breathing and relaxation techniques Take a five-second breath in through the nose, hold that breath for five seconds and then breathe out for five seconds. Do this five times, says Catherine Gallacher. Melani Halacre recommends the STAR technique. “Smile, take aand relax...breathing out longer than in to override fight and flight mechanism,” she says. Cate Campbell also recommends trying mindfulness or relaxation apps, and practising deep breathing. Write down your anxieties, and let them go It can help to express this anxiety in a way that you can control. That could be writing down what you feel, or keeping a journal. “Acknowledge that you feel this way. Don’t ignore these feelings,” says Elizabeth Turp. “Allow yourself to worry, put it down in writing in a notebook, and then put that away. Let it go.” Get access to natural light Lockdown may have limited your trips to parks and for countryside walks, but itaposs still important to get access to natural light, says Rakhi Chand. Our exposure to natural light is limited at the moment, and this affects our serotonin and melatonin levels - both vital for our mental health. Rakhi recommends sitting near windows and making home environments as light and airy as possible. If youaposre lucky enough to have a a balcony or garden, use it regularly.  She also says that certain foods - such as walnuts, almonds or bananas - can help boost melatonin, and salmon, eggs and spinach are among the foods that can help boost serotonin. She also says itaposs worth looking into Vitamin D supplements, a light therapy lamp and limiting blue light from phones or screens as it disrupts circadian rhythm. Look after your wellbeing Make sure you are looking after yourself, doing what you can to help get a good night’s sleep, eating well and doing exercise, adds Catherine Gallacher. “I always talk to my clients about a wellbeing check. Sleeping, eating, exercising. If we manage our health like this, it can help make us more robust against anxiety.” Running either on the spot, or outside, releases endorphins and fools the brain and body that they’ve run away from the danger, says Cate Campbell. Use all your senses One of the self-care tips recommended by Eve Menezes Cunningham is to use all your senses to notice where you are. You might want to notice five things you can see right now, five things you can hear right now, says Eve, or any smells or tastes. “These can help us resist the well-worn neural pathways around catastrophising and feeling helpless.” There are more of Eve’s self-care tips available to read here. No expectations, no pressure Sarah Wheatley, who specialises in helping new parents, says that she often discusses with her clients, how “when we live in extraordinary times, all bets are off.” “Since expectations can be one of the things that are dficult to manage as a new parent, when there are no expectations it can be really freeing and allow people time to find their way without any pressure. “The pressure to get back into shape, the pressure to socialise, the pressure to feed certain ways, the pressure to feel calm and relaxed, the pressure to look as though you have it ‘all together’. These pressures are reduced by physical isolation, and can be helpful to some mothers.” Positive thinking At times, this may feel very dficult to do depending on your personal situation. But re-framing a negative situation into a positive one can be very helpful. Indira Chima says: “I believe there are a lot of positives to be gained, which might not be apparent right now. It forces people to slow down and breathe and take stock and that is always a good thing.   “We live at such a fast, frenetic pace and sometimes donapost stop to think about what itaposs all about and where we are heading.  This is forcing us to do that.  And we will grow as a result of this.” Ask for support “It’s not a sign of weakness, but strength to reach out and ask for support,” says Hansa Pankhania “Make a list of everyone you know, friends, family, colleagues, neighbours etc. Now tick  people from this list, who can provide practical, psychological and moral support.  Connect with them and sustain this support circle.” If you would like support from a qualied professional, many counsellors offer online or telephone counselling. They can help you explore and understand what youaposre feeling. To find a counsellor or psychotherapist who can help you visit our Therapist Directory. I rang my mum and started crying. I said I donapost even want to go food shopping anymore because I canapost bare standing in these queues for so long. She said theyaposll probably have a policy in place for pregnant woman, so I rang up the Range to ask.The mother said she canapost get family members to do her shopping for her because they are in the high risk category for coronavirus.She continued: I was embarrassed to even phone them up but when I got through I asked the girlthere was a queue and she said yes.  I told her my situation, that Iaposm pregnant and canapost physically queue up for that long but I needed essential items. I askedthey have a policy for pregnant women, so I donapost have to wait in it and her reply really upset me. She said no you will have to queue up just like everyone , we only allow NHS staff to go to the front of the queue. I broke down when I got off the phone. The Range has been approached for comment. Amanda said she also suffers from a condition called SPD, which prevents her from being able to stand for long periods of time and can cause extreme pain.

The strict rules would include social distancing and could change the face of British pubs in the coming months with landlords turning enforcers and fining those who flout the rules. The terms are outlined in a plan by economist and government advisor Professor Eyal Winter to get the country back on its feet. He said social distancing was the key to coming out of lockdown with a clear timetable from the Government with what would happen by certain dates. And he admitted while Brits were gasping for a pint at their local, for boozers to reopen, drinkers would have to keep two meters apart and be limited to three bevvies before heading home to free up space for others to enjoy a tipple.Prof Winter of Lancaster University said: “People are starving for pubs. They are an important part of British culture.” He has been advising ministers on coronavirus lockdown and said cinemas and theatres could also re-open but with half empty auditoriums. Prof Winter toldevery other seat would have to be unoccupied but venues could recoup some money by raising ticket prices. But businesses fear social distancing could be a killer blow with the hospitality industry the hardest hit.  Katie Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality said reopening without a plan of action would be “catastrophic” for the sector, especiallysocial distancing was to become the norm for the foreseeable future. She said: “An extended period of social distancing will mean that many hospitality businesses will not be able to operate fully and many will not be able to open at all.” Restaurant owners added their concerns over how social distancing will impact on their livelihoods and Michel Roux Jr, boss of two Michelin star Le Gavroche in London called for a nine month rent amnesty. He said: “Le Gavroche has been open for  years and been through recessions, depression, winter of discontent, IRA bombings and anything  you can think of. “Nothing comes close to this crisis.”  Chef Yotam Ottolenghi who owns six restaurants and takeaways specialising in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine agreed and said: “Nobody in their right minds would say we can carry on paying rent as before.” He has had to furlough  staff amid closures and said of social distancing: “Assume we operate at % capacity - that doesn’t allow us to pay the same salaries or rents. “If we operate at -% capacity, that’s still not a sustainable business because restaurants operate at profit margins of %.” Celebrity chef Tom Kerridge has furloughed  staff at three pubs, two restaurants and an events catering business. The boss of the Hand and Flowers pub in Marlow, Bucks which was the UK’s first boozer to get two Michelin stars said: “Restaurants and pubs are not just there for the purpose of serving something to eat and drink.There is something more deeply ingrained culturally and from a social point of view.

Plans to mark the occasion, including a veterans’ procession in London, had to be adjusted due to lockdown. Her Majesty will speak to the country on TV and radio at pm on Friday, May  – the exact moment her father, King George VI, gave a radio address in . As part of the day’s commemorations, Prince Charles will read an extract from his grandfather’s diary from the same date, which describes the day, including the royal family’s iconic Buckingham Palace balcony appearance. And royals, the Prime Minister and Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden will take part in a series of video calls with Second World War veterans who served on the Home Front. As part of a special day of programming on the BBC, extracts from Sir Winston Churchill’s victory speech will recreate the moment peace in Europe was announced  years ago at pm. Mr Dowden will call on the public to mark the occasion in their homes, while war veterans will receive calls from NHS Volunteer Responders.  The Government has produced a pack so the public can hold a s-style afternoon tea party at home with homemade bunting, original recipes, games and educational and creative activities for children. He said: “We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the greatest generation that served in combat and on the home front during the Second World War.

Neumil, the companyaposs lead mCBM, is already being developed for the universal treatment of respiratory tract infections , including Influenza Virus , Respiratory Syncytial Virus , and now coronaviruses. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   Lead researcher Gary Taylor, professor of biology at St Andrews, told the Daily Mail : Classic antivirals actually attack some part of the virusaposs machinery, whereas our drug actually inhibits the virus from even getting into cells. We envision it being given as a nasal spray, and imagine it being given weekly or every other day.  It works by masking glycan receptors in patientsapos airways and thereby preventing the entry of the virus and has the potential to revolutionise the treatment of RTIs. This is because it provides clinicians with the opportunity to offer patients total protection against any circulating viral strain.  The successful studies involved both treating infection and blocking new infections with MCBMs, using plaque - visible structures in a sheet of cells - reduction tests. Pneumagen has been working closely with Public Health Englandaposs Porton facility and separately with the University of GlasgowapossMRC Centre for Virus Research. At both Porton and UoG, the mCBMs were found to reduce the number of Sars-CoV- plaques in these tests when the mCBMs were used in both prevention and treatment of infection. Pneumagen now wants to begin clinical testing for the prevention and treatment of Covid-. Its chief executive Douglas Thomson said: Todayaposs positive results from in-vitro studies of our mCBMs against coronaviruses show that glycan binding has the potential to prevent and treat infection. This further supports the value of our universal therapeutic modality to block access to lung cells of Sars-CoV-, as well as other viruses, that cause respiratory tract infections, providing the potential for a pan-viral respiratory product.

Admin assistant Becca Brown is in debt after splurging her £, savings and more on masks, gloves and shields, but believes medical authorities should have been more prepared. The -year-old, who keeps the PPE under lock and key, is even using some of her unused lesaving equipment to create coronavirus-themed artwork.And in an attempt to recover some of the £ credit card debt she accumulated, Becca has admitted selling some PPE on eBay for five times the original price.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.   This comes as Brits stood in silence yesterday to remember the brave medics and carers who have died fighting the virus.Official figures show  NHS workers and  social care staff have lost their lives to covid-, though it is feared those numbers are far higher.While nurses have been forced to wear bin bags due to the drastically short supply of equipment in hospitals.Becca - who has been abandoned by many of her friends - cares for an elderly aunt near Portsmouth and began ordering PPE online early in the crisis to avoid regular trips to the shops. She bought  pairs of surgical gloves when they were selling at around £ for a box for , as well as specialist respiratory masks with filters,  face shields and disposable gowns and overalls.When the coronavirus hit I decided I was going to be ready, she told The Sun.

Initially the Centre for Disease Controllisted just three symptoms for Covid- which were: shortness of breath, a cough and a fever. But as doctors have learned more about the deadly bug, which has claimed the lives of more than , people in the UK, they have updated their list of symptoms. The CDC in America now reports the symptoms which could appear between two to  days of exposure to the virus as:Chills Repeated shaking with chills Muscle pain Headache Sore throat New loss of taste or smellIn an  Iranian study, % of Covid- patients who reported a loss of smell said it had a sudden onset. In many of the cases, anosmia, as it’s called, appeared before other symptoms. Vallery Lomas, a -year-old champion baker, told the Washington Post: “It scared the hell out of me. “I could smell nothing for probably five days.” Professor Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society and a leading ear, nose and throat consultant surgeon, is leading the charge to get loss of sense of smell recognised by the World Health Organization and Public Health England as a coronavirus symptom.  Prof. Hopkins said: One in six patients will lose their sense of smell as an isolated symptom, really without getting any other associated symptoms. One in four will get it along with other symptoms, but right at the beginning of infection. It is a good early marker of infection. She added: When you look at all the dferent symptoms, loss of sense of smell is actually one of the best predictors of Covid- infection. Much better than fever, and more prevalent and a stronger predictor than cough. In France, researchers are preparing to launch a human trial to test their hypothesis that nicotine can help the body combat the Covid- infection.  The trial will involve groups of healthcare workers and patients wearing nicotine patches and other groups wearing placebo patches. Then they will be tested to seethere is a dference in how their bodies respond to the virus. The trial is a follow-up to a French study, published this month, of public health data which appeared to show that people who smoke are % less likely to catch Covid- than non-smokers of the same age and sex. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus."},{"url":null,"title":"kids under 10 can hug","story":"NewsKids under  can hug grandparents in Switzerland as they cant pass on coronavirusChildren aged under  in Switzerland have been allowed to visit their grandparents and give them a hug after scientists believe youngsters cannot pass on coronavirusShareCommentsByJeremy Culley:,  APR NewsThe move by the Swiss could indicate that primary schools could soon reopen \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

He added: “That is why small children pose no risk to high-risk patients or grandparents.” He said family get-togethers, babysitting and time outside with other kids were still forbidden.

Dominic Raab has agreed social distancing measures would need to be in place while the Scottish government has suggested classrooms might be re-designed.Experts have said schools reopening could be a first phase of lockdown being eased, and could happen this side of the summer holidays, or be delayed until September.  Italy has opted for the latter, while in Denmark kids under  were allowed back earlier this month.

John-Paul Drike, the director of Drakes Supermarkets in Adelaide, Australia, says he responded simply by giving the alleged hoarder the middle finger. In a stunning YouTube video, the supermarket boss has vented his anger at those who have taken advantage of the desperate rush for basic household supplies amid the coronavirus pandemic. He claimed that one unidentied customer had been audacious enough to purchase  -roll packets of loo roll and  units of one-litre sanitiser from his shop - and then later ask for a refund. Follow the latest coronavirus updates here “I had my first customer yesterday who said he wanted to get a refund on  packets of -pack toilet paper and  units of one-litre sanitiser, Mr Drake says in his video on April . Flipping his middle finger at the screen, he added: “I told him that.  Branding those who have been panic-buying supplies such as toilet paper absolutely ridiculous, he continued: That is the sort of person that is causing the problem in the whole country. Speaking to News, he said the man wanted to get rid of the items because he was no longer able to sell them on eBay after his site was shut down. He claimed that he had as many as  people working with him to buy up the highly-sought after commodities. Australiaaposs Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, has said that the government will come down like a ton of bricks on supermarket hoarders who have been clearing shelves of basic supplies. Speaking last month, he said that that anyone caught profiteering from buying up essential groceries such as food and toilet paper will be prosecuted.

Despite the campaign finishing nine matches short, we are delighted to announce the   Tele Sport Player of the Year for Dundee.The votes have been cast, averages for players having started  games vied up and there are no worries about emails turning up or not.The   Tele Sport Player of the Year is Paul McGowan for the second year running.After a very strong start, the midfielder’s influence grew throughout the season as the team got to grips with the Championship challenge. As ever, McGowan rarely fell below a seven out of  rating, finishing the season off with an eight after a wonderful assist for Kane Hemmings against Ayr, as well as key displays against Partick and an earlier showing against the Honest Men. After six years at the club, ‘Gowser’ is still going strong in dark blue.Fans favourite, Hemmings, ran McGowan very close with a strong run of form since the middle of December, breaking the -goal barrier in the final match against Ayr. Impressive showings in wins over Dunfermline and Partick in December stand out but his top display came back in October at a chilly Alloa, where the only disappointment was when he fluffed a chance to seal a hat-trick late on.The -year-old was a real star for manager James McPake after he gave him a regular run in the first team at the beginning of the campaign. Such a steady and unflustered player in the middle of the park, Robertson allowed the more experienced players to shine alongside him. That’s not stopped the teenager picking up regular good grades, in particular a fine showing against Dundee United at Tannadice in December.The first signing of the season, former Partick and Ayr winger, McDaid, showed dferent sides to his game last term. When the team struggled to create goalscoring opportunities early on, McDaid was still a regular threat and he’s shown his defensive capabilities more recently as a wing-back. His tackling in the area in derbies may need some work but McDaid will be determined that the best is yet to come from him in dark blue.Undoubtedly a class act in the middle of the park, Scotland international Dorrans showed glimpses of his best form throughout the campaign as he worked himself back to full fitness following y injury issues. The ex-Rangers man grabbed a vital goal at Tannadice in the - derby draw in December and was a driving force throughout.It seems defenders didn’t fare too well in   but make up almost the rest of the top .Honourable mentions go to Jordan McGhee ., Jordon Forster ., Jack Hamilton ., Shaun Byrne . and Jordan Marshall .."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"man caught sleeping in dundee airbnb flat is given chance to behave","story":"A man who was caught sleeping in an Airbnb flat after breaking into it has been given a chance to behave himself.Jacek Turek, , previously admitted forcing his way into a property on High Street on July  last year.Dundee Sherf Court previously heard that Turek committed the offence in order to find a place to sleep for the night.Police were called and found Turek in possession of a rucksack that contained a stolen iron.He also previously admitted possessing a kne on Victoria Street in May , and breaching bail by being out with his home address during curfew on June , June , September  and October  and October  the same year.Sherf John Rafferty deferred sentence on Turek until July for him to be of good behaviour.He was bailed to the Woodlands Hotel on Panmure Terrace."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.10619467-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"proposal for flats in muirhead rejected","story":"Plans to demolish a Muirhead garage and build a block of flats in its place have been rejected by Angus Council.An application was submitted to the local authority in January by JIB Properties which hoped to build a two-storey block comprising of six flats on the site of the existing garage on Newtyle Road in the Angus village.Several applications had previously been submitted to the council and subsequently withdrawn, with the most recent outlining plans to develop the site into flats at the start of the year.The council had raised concerns about the latest proposal, in particular with what was described as the “overbearing impact” and the style of the design, which the local authority did not believe fitted in with the local area.An agent for the applicant disputed these concerns, saying the development would be  smaller than the existing vehicle repair garage.But the council was unmoved and rejected the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"day-four-glasgow-students-handed-stone-destiny","story":"HISTORY will always remember the four Glasgow university students who stole the Stone of Destiny."},{"url":null,"title":"five-facts-pioneering-hospice-founder-dr-anne-gilmore","story":" Dr Anne Gilmore, founder of the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow ,was from Knightswood.

scheme to help crews moored in city","story":"Aberdeen Harbour Board has launched an initiative to help crews working on vessels moored in the port.The scheme allows vessels to book a four-hour welfare visit slot for their vessel, instead of making a full port call booking.The slot allows a vessel to stock up on essential supplies such as food, fuel, and critical spares during the coronavirus pandemic.Port operations manager John McGuigan said: “Fees for coming into the harbour are normally paid by the company chartering the vessel and they book a full port call to allow the vessel to be loaded with cargo.“During the Covid- crisis, however, when there is less work available, we wanted to support vessel owners and crews who are currently not on charter and to ensure their welfare throughout these unprecedented times.“We are calling the scheme Stow and Go but I guess it is a bit like booking your pick-up slot at the supermarket”.Harbour chief executive Michelle Handforth added: “We are very conscious of the impact that the current public health crisis is having, not only on our customers but also on the vessel owners and crews who support them.“While crews are in between work, they can spend signicant amounts of time out at the Aberdeen anchorage.“There are on average  vessels on any given day located there and we were keen to make the situation as good as possible for those crew who, along with those keeping the port open, are essential workers who are doing their bit in this crisis.”The scheme is open to all vessels at the anchorage and will be reviewed when the lockdown ends with a view to it being extended.It comes after Aberdeen Harbour said the port is still operational despite the “exceptional” circumstances."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/04/5ea7c645b6c6e3.11309789-752x564.jpg ","title":"call for public to keep on donating to

vegetables, tinned fruit, Cup a Soups and Pot Noodles.“Other things like toilet roll and male boxer shorts, in smaller sizes, are also in high demand.“At the moment, we also have some service users who are moving into new tenancies or temporary accommodation.“They are finding it dficult to access items like crockery, bedding, basic furniture and white goods due to the closure of some second-hand

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering.

into it.I found a little information about it.It was located in Dam Brae and was said to contain water with special qualities that helped make a perfect pot of tea.There is little explanation as to what exactly these qualities were, but it seems to have been widely believed and accepted in the past.Tea, of course, became popular in Scotland, and by the th century it had become an important accompaniment to the often mundane diet of working class people, providing a refreshing non-alcoholic alternative to beer.For the poor, tea drinking wasnrsquot linked to formal social rituals as it was with the upper classes.Tea was the drink of the working class as they worked.So, a well in the heart of the town which was believed to supply good tea making water will have been a busy and popular place.Many people, likely mostly women, would have congregated around the well.In the OS name book from the s, it was clearly recorded that the well was listed as the ldquoVickerrsquos Well, but then goes on to state that ldquono person in the locality knows it by that name.Everyone called it ldquothe bickers well.Perhaps this was a result of local dialect changing the name over time.But Paul Bennet, in his interesting website ldquoThe Northern Antiquarian says ldquothere is the obvious possibility that the ldquobickers ndash as in chit-chat and gossip ndash related to it being where local folk simply met and chatted.Perhaps the reputation of the wellrsquos water for making quality tea also meant people from further afield considered it worthwhile to detour here, in order to make that extra special ldquoBickerrsquos Brew.One account says it was once surrounded by old trees.All of this conjures an image of an important social meeting place, with people meeting under the shade of old trees, exchanging views and information and having a good blether while they wait their turn to draw water from the celebrated well.Was the belief in the goodness of the water rooted in some older tradition Perhaps it was a revered holy well, as some have suggested It seems to have been associated with the vicarage of St Michaels nearby, which roots the well in Musselburghrsquos ancient past, and gives a reason for the name Vicarrsquos Well.The well was replaced by a pump sometime in the nineteenth century, and then was blocked up, and became forgotten.When Irsquod discovered all this I set out to find the location of the well to seethere was still any evidence of it.Dam Brae is now named Kilwinning Place and I studied a nineteenth century map which marked the exact location of the well, then compared it to a modern one and set out on my quest.I found the location. Irsquom sure of it, and took a photo.But there wasnrsquot really anything of much interest to see other than a slab on the ground where I believe the well once stood.It seemed so forgotten, and put me in a melancholy mood for a moment.I reflected on the way something that had been a tradition for so long, and such a part of many peoplersquos lives can just vanish, and be utterly forgotten.I know it was just a well and so might not seem important.But it was a meeting place for ordinary people for generations.The simple shared routines and places in our lives are often the ones we remember with nostalgia.We donrsquot think of them as history or worthy of recording until all memory has gone, and itrsquos too late.I thought about this as we were going on our local family walk this week.I suppose we all know we are living through a time that will be recorded by history.But when all this is over, and things are back to ldquonormal what simple things will you, and your family, remember from this time and what will you want remembered For me, this includes seeing the Greenhills carpeted with wildflowers for the first time that I can remember, watching children cycle on empty streets and deserted car parks, and queuing in shops, keeping our physical distance while also trying to stay social.For sure the toilet roll panic will be part of history.But all of us will have special moments and places that connect to the emotions of this time.There will be stories of peoplersquos wonderful community spirit, what it felt like to be confined in the house for weeks, and how we entertained ourselves.We are all historians of our own time, and we should find ways to record and remember the simple, but important, things we have felt and encountered during this time of crisis.Because memory fades, and as the fate of the Bickers Well shows,memories are not recorded or stories of them not told, they will be forgotten.And so this was why I decided to re-visit the story of the Bickers Well for my column this week.It may have originally seemed there was not much to tell about it.Yet once there was.But the memories and the stories connected to it seemed so simple and obvious at the time that nobody really thought them important enough to record or keep treasured.Now all that remains of those stories is a slab on the pavement.The technology we have makes it easier now to share and record our lives.So letrsquos use it to consciously be historians and storytellers of this dficult time to capture images and feelings, the happenings that may today seem too simple and commonplace to record, but in future will be a fascinating insight to our lives in this historic event.For me, that is the lesson of the Bickers Well."},{"url":null,"title":"winton-brewery-takes-countys-micropub","story":"Steve Holligan and David Mackinnon, from Winton Brewery, stepped behind the bar at Dunbarrsquos Station Yard Micropub at the beginning of the month.Currently, the duo are only allowed to sell off-sales, due to the coronavirus lockdown preventing customers from entering the pub, but they were looking forward to once again welcoming people inside as soon as possible.Steve said: ldquoWersquove been looking for a while to find something like this.ldquoThe Station Yard is unbelievable.ldquoWe looked in Haddington, we looked in Gullane and we wanted to stay in East Lothian, where we are from and where the brewery is based.ldquoIt was one of those things where you were scrolling through Facebook and this popped up.ldquoIt was too good an opportunity and we got in touch with Gerard McPhillips [who had created the pub alongside his late business partner David McGee] and had a really good meeting with him.

Donrsquot be afraid to substitute any ingredients. Its important to cut the creaminess of the cheese with acidity form the orange. Salmoriglio is an easy dressing that is great for using up herbs past their best. It is also excellent on steamed greens or to marinade fish.

Instead, the site suggests mixing it with green tea as a natural toner.Should you be missing the skin-smoothing effect of an eye-watering beauty salon chemical peel, you may want to follow the online sitersquos alternative: granulated sugar, mixed with olive oil then a right good rub.For those who can spare some beer, its yeast content will help fight excessive sebum production and the bacteria that causes acne.Mix with egg whites and mashed strawberries then use as a face pack ndash or just pretend itrsquos a beery kind of meringue and eat it.While the websitersquos store cupboard treatments may seem a shade desperate, according to Claire Gray of Glasgow-based skincare specialist Ermana, there is real merit in seeking out a more natural approach to our skincare regimes.ldquoAt the moment, most of us are focused on shopping for essentials such as food and medicine, and skincare is often viewed as a luxury product, she says.ldquoBut all this time indoors and washing our hands is having an impact on our skin.For eyes strained from peering too long at Tiger King on Netflix, she has an age-old remedy: ldquoThe tannins in tea can help reduce puffiness and get rid of dark circles. Simply soak a tea bag in warm water and place on your eyes for  minutes.ldquoFor an astringent or toner, wipe a teabag over your face to tighten skin and then blot with a towel.With coffee shops closed and our espresso fix now confined to home, there is a use for all those spent coffee grounds. ldquoSimply add some coffee grounds to coconut oil to make your own at-home scrub, she says.ldquoThe coffee grains help remove dirt and dead skin cells and promote overall skin health, and the scrubbing action stimulates blood flow and can help to reduce cellulite.ldquoThe caffeine in coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties that can help protect the skin from sun damage.While honeyrsquos antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiseptic properties mean it makes a handy face mask, so too do the fats, minerals and vitamins in mashed avocado.Pineapple is almost a skincare superfood: vitamin C, bromelain and antioxidants can help prevent and treat acne, fine lines, sun damage and uneven tone. Rub it on, leave for a few minutes and rinse off.Gray suggests therersquos even a skincare use for that bottle of apple cider vinegar lurking at the back of the cupboard. ldquoThe main ingredient in apple cider vinegar is acetic acid but it also contains lots of other natural alpha-hydroxy acids, she says.ldquoThese work together to gently exfoliate the skin by dissolving dead skin cells. Applying apple cider vinegar to the skin also delivers beneficial enzymes, proteins and good bacteria.With hand-washing a national hobby, she suggests taking particular care when choosing which soaps to buy.ldquoHandwashes contain water and any product with water has preservatives to stop it degrading. Andit says lsquoparfumrsquo on the bottle, itrsquoll have a multitude of sins.ldquoItrsquos much better to choose a natural soap, such as one made with olive oil.Helen Atherton of Edinburgh-based soap specialist, Dook, agrees that while washing hands with soap is a proven virus-killer, many harsh supermarket soaps will also wreck our hands.ldquoThe dference between a bar of handmade soap and a manufactured one is huge, she says. ldquoIn handmade soaps, the natural glycerine thatrsquos squeezed out in the industrial process is retained.

There is no other artist who documented Glasgow so extraordinarily during that period. Itrsquos not enough for Scottish art and big institutions like Kelvingrove to be limited to the most popular names like the Glasgow Boys, Jack Vettriano or Charles Rennie Mackintosh.ldquoPeople are very familiar with the work of the Glasgow Boys. But Glasgow has other painters. Therersquos a Glasgow Girl. Shersquos not even Scottish but came here and fell in love with the city to such an extent that she painted it throughout her short le. Eardley is a hugely important British artist and she should have a major exhibition in a British institution of note, like the Tate.Eardley was born on May , , on a dairy farm in Warnham, Sussex. Her family later moved to London and then, in , amid the growing threat of war, to Bearsden.The following year, she began her studies at Glasgow School of Art and proved fearless in her pursuit of subjects to paint. Her wanderings brought her to impoverished Townhead in the northeast of the city, where she established a studio. The paintings Eardley did there ndash particularly her famous portraits of the Samson children ndash are considered landmarks of th-century art.For her niece Anne Morrison, a Bearsden-based ceramicist, Eardleyrsquos relationship with an urban district which was facing the demolition ball is an example of just how daring and exceptional she was.ldquoTownhead was just not the area that you would go to ndash I was kept well away from it, she said. ldquoEven my brother, who was a couple of years older, said he had never been up there either. It was not the place to be. It was just the poverty and seeing what that part of Glasgow looked like. Middle-class kids just did not get taken there.ldquoShe actually caught something that was disappearing at the time, as the buildings were getting knocked down and people were getting moved where. It captured something of the city and the children there. Itrsquos not glorying it but itrsquos capturing it in a very human way.Morrison suggested that the lack of a major event to mark the centenary of Eardleyrsquos birth could have something to do with the Scottishness of her work.ldquoIt does seem right to have a celebration of her work but it does not seem to be happening, she added. ldquoHer name gets forgotten. She has not had the recognition at a UK level that she should. Thatrsquos the trouble. Shersquos a Scottish artist and she gets put aside because her subjects were Scottish as well.Laura Cumming, art critic for The Observer, described Eardley as ldquoone of the deepest landscape artists who ever lived, and among the most humanitarian painters of men, women and especially children.She added: ldquoEvery opportunity to see her work is precious ndash anywhere at all.ldquoThere have been shows in Scotland, the last that I remember was in . She deserves many more, and so the ideal would be a touring show that took in London, presenting her work throughout the United Kingdom to a new generation. Next year must not be allowed to slip by without a full-scale retrospective of her powerfully stirring and beautul work.Arts journalist Jan Patience said: ldquoThe National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh has done a power of work to cement her reputation with two major shows in the last  years, but there has been no major Eardley show for years in Glasgow, the city she called home. I believe the last one was in what was then called The Third Eye Centre in the s.ldquoAn Eardley show in Glasgow would attract visitors in their thousands and a no-show in her centenary year shows a real lack of vision.Local authorities in Scotlandrsquos largest cities said events were being organised or considered to mark the anniversary.A spokeswoman for Glasgow Le said: ldquoAs one of Scotlandrsquos most popular th-century artists we anticipate a small programme of events to mark Joan Eardleyrsquos centenary.ldquoWe are pleased to have a small number of her drawings and paintings in our collection, which includes the much-loved oil Glasgow Kids, a Saturday Matineacutee Picture Queue, on show in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. However, we do not hold the breadth of works required to stage a standalone exhibition.An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said: ldquoEardleyrsquos work is showcased as one of the Our Collection highlights in Gallery  ndash Collecting Art and her work can be seen throughout the collections galleries. A number of the oils we own are on display, including a powerful seascape painted at Catterline.ldquoThe  centenary of Joan Eardleyrsquos birth presents a welcome opportunity for us to celebrate the artistrsquos strong connection with the northeast of Scotland in a number of ways.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which runs the McManus Gallery and Museum, said: ldquoWe have no current plans to mark the Joan Eardley centenary next year.A spokesman for the National Galleries of Scotland said: ldquoThe National Galleries celebrated the le and work of Joan Eardley in a comprehensive exhibition just three years ago, and the exhibitionrsquos curator Patrick Elliott, a leading expert on Eardley, is writing a book on Eardley and Catterline as part of the centenary celebrations. All future plans, including publication of this book and our exhibition schedule, are subject to review due to the ongoing health crisis. However, we do intend on marking Eardleyrsquos centenary next summer, in one form or another.The Tate galleries declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  The lockdown exit plan is ageist  Over-70s can decide what   s best for their health","story":"They are a mixture of the married, orced and widowed.

Many of us, myself included, will have come to the conclusion that social contact, time spent with other human beings, is the most precious thing in our lives.This is certainly the case for most of the older folk I speak tonow, especially those who have lost their partner and or live alone. Spending time with children, grandchildren, siblings and pals is what keeps them going. It doesnrsquot take a PhD in psychology to work out that Skype and Zoom will only suffice for so long.I was walking in an empty Glasgow city centre recently and the saddest thing of all was the absence of the cheery bands of elderly ladies and gents that usually frequent Sauchiehall Street on week days, comparing prices and purchases, enjoying a cuppa and a scone, or a pint. The thought of them home alone indefinitely, stoic as they may be, is heartbreaking. For some in care homes, extended isolation will be torturous.Itrsquos one thing ordering people to live without friends and family for a few weeks. Itrsquos something  entirely telling them to do so for months, maybe years. Even for their own good. Some, especially those in the autumn of their lives, may understandably decide it is a sacrice they are not willing to make.There has been much talk recently about treating people like adults. This must include the over-s, who, letrsquos face it, have been grown up for longer than anybody .To be clear, I am not advocating reckless breaking of current lockdown rules. Irsquom saying we need a sensible approach to what comes next, one that doesnrsquot discriminate against the elderly. One that ensures le is still worth living.All columnists are free to express their opinions.

The man we have all been holding out for, Bonnie Tyler-style. The knight to make the day better, the warrior to put an arm around us and speak softly of peace and love and when we can all be together again. Lord, thank you for Tom Hardy.Sorry, did you think I meant Boris Johnson  Thatrsquos the trouble with narrators ndash some are unreliable.The Prime Minister did have a tale to tell on histo work yesterday, but it was one we have heard so often in recent days .It was pretty scary, too, with mention of second spikes and maximum risk, and we could all do with a little less of the terrying stuff, thank you. Still, good to see him back.It was even nicer, though, to see Tom Hardy rock up once more in the Bedtime Stories slot on CBeebies last night. The Oscar-nominated star of Inception, Dunkirk, Mad Max, and The Dark Knight Rises, and soon to be seen playing Al Capone, proved a huge hit in his first stint as storyteller in .The title of ldquoCBeebiesrsquo most popular Bedtime Stories reader, as bestowed by the corporation, hardly did the phenomenon justice. Children loved him, certainly, but they found themselves having to fight for a place on the sofa with everyone  who had fallen under the actorrsquos spell. The stories have been requested more than a million times on iPlayer.Now the laurelled Mr Hardy is back, with his trusty canine companion, Blue the French bulldog, by his side.Every night this week Hardy can be seen reading stories from a bench in his garden, with the film crew at a safe social distance. For these are tales specially chosen for lockdown times.The first story, Hug Me, by Simone Ciraolo, is about a lonely cactus. Under The Same Sky by Robert Vescio and Nicky Johnston looks at being far apart from friends, while Donrsquot Worry, Little Crab by Chris Haughton reassures children about trying new things. There are six stories in total, all ten minutes long and best watched before bedtime.For a lot of parents Hardyrsquoswill be a boon. How do you explain to very young children what is going on out there  How can you reassure them that everything is going to be okay while bringing home to them the importance of washing hands and staying safe  One super smart three-and-a-half-year-old of my acquaintance calls the virus ldquothe germs . She tells her grandpa that she cannot wait to see him again after ldquothe germs have gone.Sitting comfortably in the Spring sun, Hardy set the perfect tone from the off. ldquoHello, Irsquom Tom, he said.Oh we know Tom, we know.Dressed in a check shirt and sporting a rough beard and slicked back hairhe was the picture of calm, his voice a backrub for the soul.ldquoNow sometimes, on a day like this, I feel strong and I feel happy.Same here, Tom, same here.ldquoBut on other days I just want someone to give me a hug.Read our minds, pal, read our minds.There followed the wonderful tale of a tiny cactus called Felipe, ldquowho just wants a hug too. Hug Me had everything: beautul illustrations, drama, laughs and tragedy . Above all, it ended happily, and with a special message from Tom.ldquoItrsquos not always possible to be able to hug those we love, but you must always remember that they are always with us. In our heart.He paused for a moment. It was so quiet you could hear tears fall from a grandparsquos eyes.Story over, Hardy bade us good night and said he would see us all again tomorrow for another tale. No Churchillian rhetoric, no soaring themes and grand arcs: just a simple, heartfelt message for complicated times.The end.CBeebies Bedtime Stories is on each weekday at .pm on the CBeebies channel and is also available on BBC iPlayer."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-mackay-scotlands-handling-schools-lockdown-national-disgrace","story":"Those four pupils, though, marked a decline on last week ndash when the average number who attended the teacherrsquos online lessons was six per day from the same class of .In these virtual classrooms teachers set their pupils work online. Children engage throughout the day with their teachers ndash messaging, video chatting. They submit work, the work is marked, feedback is given. Lockdown lessons, to all intents and purposes, are like being at school hellip thatrsquoschildren attend, of course.It seems, however, that the Scottish Government, councils and some parents are failing when it comes to the duty of care society must take to ensure our children get a decent education during this time of pandemic.The one set of people who canrsquot be blamed for the truancy crisis in our virtual classrooms is teachers. They want to teach. They set up their online classrooms, they prepare lessons, and then they wait to see how many, or rather, how few children turn up. Itrsquos the authorities and parents who have the responsibility to get children to teachersrsquo virtual classrooms so our educators can do their job.We knew things would be tough when it came to making education work during lockdown, but the devastation being wrought on the learning of our young is nothing short of scandalous. If I was still the parent of school-age children Irsquod be furious at the failure, and frightened for their future.A survey by the Scottish Secondary Teachersrsquo Association, before Easter, found that less than half of children are engaging with teachers. Just one per cent of teachers reported  per cent engagement. Fourteen per cent said there was  per cent engagement, and  per cent reported  per cent engagement. Five per cent said children were not engaging at all.:Andrew McKie: The PM has judged the public mood better than his criticslsquoEngagementrsquo means a pupil logs in to their virtual classroom and takes part in online lessons with their teacher.Primary schools may be fairing even worse. One teacher I spoke to told me they usually had half a dozen pupils who fully engage. They teach at an inner city Scottish primary. Many children are poor and vulnerable. Before lockdown the class was at maximum capacity:  children.Apart from the six who fully engage with lessons every day, there are six to eight other pupils who ldquopop in and out. They come online, look at resources, maybe try something and then go.Then there are around - pupils who are ldquovisible to the teacher ndash in other words, they can see these children have read messages left for them or looked at resources ndash but they donrsquot engage at all.And finally, therersquos the biggest worry ndash at least six children are completely ldquooff radar. They havenrsquot logged on, they havenrsquot been seen to read messages. In effect, the school doesnrsquot know where they are or what is happening to them. Senior management are, of course, trying to get in touch ndash theyrsquore calling and emailing parents. But teachers need help keeping our children safe. As in ordinary times, during lockdown teachers need social workers and truancy officers and family support teams to assist them day to day.The teacher said that what was true of their class was ldquopretty much the same for the rest of the school. They also said it was ldquopretty much the same when it came to the cluster of schools in their local area. And across the rest of Scotland  ldquoAnecdotally, itrsquos also pretty much the same, they said.:Scottish Governments education reputation in tatters after exam analysis sagaTeachers are happy to be flexible. They donrsquot mind teaching some kids at eight in the morning and others at tea-timethatrsquos what works for families. But they need parents and central and local government to back them and get children to virtual school.What makes all this worse is the response from the Scottish Government. Last week, I contacted the Government askingofficials knew how many children were attending lockdown lessons in Scotland.This was the comment I got from a Scottish Government spokesperson: ldquoWe do not collect a figure on how many children across Scotland are taking part in online virtual classes with schools. We believe that it would be a signicant burden to ask teachers to report this centrally at a time when they are, rightly, focussing their efforts on teaching their pupils.ldquoHowever, we are aware that considerable positive work has already been undertaken by teachers and education professionals across Scotland to support continuity in learning while most schools remain shut. This includes ious arrangements using dferent services such as those available through the Glow .Itrsquos the sort of typical jargon-speak which means nothing. However, teachers Irsquove spoken to say it would be no burden at all to ask them to report how many children are attending lessons. Theyrsquore taking a virtual register every morning anyway, so passing it on to the authorities wouldnrsquot be an imposition.Teachers told me that what needs to be done is this: during lockdown the class register should be used by local and central government for monitoring attendance just as in normal times. If a child is absent from virtual lessons without reason, or repeatedly, then call in the virtual truancy officer. Children cannot be left to stagnate educationally during lockdown.Teachers are often a convenient whipping boy for governments and society at large. Today, amid this pandemic, theyrsquore doing their best to prepare our children for adulthood but they are the ones being failed.Of course, itrsquos hard for parents to cope during lockdown but nobody said being a parent was easy. The lockdown is stressful, frightening, but children need to get up in the morning, brush their teeth, eat their breakfast, and go to their virtual school.Equally, some parents may be too poor to afford the technology needed for their child to participate in online lessons. In that case, the Government should set up an emergency fund, distributed by councils, which provides families in need with computers to educate their children.Coronavirus is killing a lot of things. It cannot be allowed to claim the future of our children ndash particularly our most vulnerable children.

We need recovery planning and additional funding in place today. ldquoWhat is at stake are both people and heritage - the two are intertwined and are part of the bedrock of successful communities. ldquoScotland is seen as a world leader with its extraordinary wealth of community-run heritage.

However, he urged the Justice Secretary to reflect on what was happening in England and Wales, where court services were making use of telephone, video and other technology to allow remote hearings and procedural business to take place.Kirkwall Sherf Court has been closed due to the coronavirus crisis, with emergency business transferred to a ‘hub’ in Inverness. However, concerns have been raised about the impact of this transfer, as well as obstacles in the way of securing new ship orders and Powers of Attorney.The Justice Secretary acknowledged these concerns, and offered to pursue the issue with the Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service.Mr McArthur said: “Nothing is ‘business as usual’ at the moment, and the well-being of court staff and the wider public has to be the number one priority.  However, there are many aspects of civil court business that we cannot afford to put on pause.“Over recent weeks, I have been contacted by local solicitors in Orkney, extremely concerned at the dficulties they have faced in getting urgent business completed.  Delays in getting a new ship Orders or Powers of Attorney in place, for example, can have serious consequences. Vulnerable people rely on effective and timely court processes that make sure their rights are properly safeguarded.“In England and Wales we are seeing technology being used to enable more court business to be undertaken. There is no reason why a similar approach cannot be adopted in Scotland.  Indeed, Sherf Courts already conduct procedural hearings by tele-conferencing.“The justice secretary insists that progress is being made, but has offered to take up these concerns with the Scottish Court and Tribunals Service.

In challenging circumstances, however, they are not helped by supply chains that are simply not operating fairly or equitably.“During a recent conference call with the cabinet secretary and islands minister, I raised concerns about the behaviour of some suppliers towards our island communities. It was a call echoed by MSP and MP colleagues from across the parties.“Unfortunately, two weeks on and shop owners and local wholesalers, who also supply our care homes and hospital, tell me little has changed. If anything, the situation is getting more serious.“I welcome Fergus Ewing’s recognition of the problem and the action he has taken in writing to  of the main suppliers. However, these efforts must now be redoubled as we need to see a dference on the ground.The Orkney MSP added: “At a time of crisis, getting access to food and essential items should not be a postcode lottery. Supply chains should be working in the interests of the entire population, and suppliers should be treating island wholesalers with fairness”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This might included certain businesses being allowed to reopen where customers can safely stay at a two metre distance, and the reformatting of classrooms before pupils canto schools.The First Minister has advised that restrictions are likely to continue in some form for at least the rest of this year, and possibly beyond that.She added that the Scottish Government would be relying on the latest data to inform it of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing. When asked about whether certain regions of Scotland might undergo a more localised approach, the First Minister said she wasn#t ruling out anything that might help us deal with the virus.#Today I am seeking to start a grown up conversation with the public about the complex decisions that lie ahead of us as we look beyond lockdown,# she said.“As we have done all along, we will seek to inform the public with the best scientic advice possible, but the science will never be exact and we are in uncharted territory so we also need to make careful judgements and be prepared to adapt and change course as we go.“We want to ease restrictions, but we cannot rule out having to reapply them should the virus run out of control.#Nicola Sturgeon said she and her colleagues would be relying on the latest data to inform them of what the best approach for Scotland will be and explained that work to expand the nations testing capacity was ongoing.“Every day we see evidence that this virus causes real harm, but so too do the lockdown measures we are taking to contain it,# she continued.#This is causing harm to the economy and living standards, to children’s education and to mental health and wellbeing.“That is why we need to try to find a better balance than the one we have now, but as we do so we cannot take our eye off the need to suppress the virus and minimise the damage it does.“It is only when we are sure the virus is under control that we can even start to ease any of the restrictions because the virus will not have gone away.#Nicola Sturgeon has advised everyone to take part in the conversation about how we might leave lockdown.

The academic suggested that the next stages of coronavirus containment could be developed earlier in the islands # but onlya comprehensive testing strategy was in place.Orkney and Shetland’s parliamentarians, Liam McArthur MSP, Alistair Carmichael MP and Beatrice Wishart MSP have called on the Scottish Government to provide assurances that they will engage meaningfully with Professor Pennington’s proposals and be open to considering how they might be implemented safely.Mr McArthur said: “Public safety must be paramount as decisions are taken about how and when the current restrictions might be lted.“In that context, however, Professor Pennington’s suggestions, which have already attracted a great deal of interest in Orkney and other island communities, deserve serious and urgent consideration.“If the Scottish Government genuinely want to treat the Scottish public ‘as grown ups’ then suggestions like these need to be dealt with in a transparent manner.“I have already written to both the Health Secretary and the First Minister to make this point, and to seek clarity on what consideration is being given to a more localised approach for the islands.  It is important that all options to tackling the coronavirus remain on the table during this unprecedented time.”Mr Carmichael added: “I hope that the Scottish Government will engage with these proposals seriously. That engagement must, however, also include close cooperation and discussion with local communities to ensure public confidence in safety.“This is not a plan that can be run centrally. Local input and know-how is key and islanders should be at the heart of how we translate these proposals into action.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Until late last year, a suitable vessel proved dficult to source, said the council.It then became known that the Nordic Sea, which operated on a number of passenger routes in the far north of Norway, had become available.Following visits and sea trials involving Orkney Marine Services and Orkney Ferries staff, the vessel was considered as a suitable replacement for the Golden Mariana.As the Nordic Sea was operating under a Norwegian Passenger Certicate, it was known that a number of requirements would have to be met before she was considered ready for a UK passenger certicate.With surveys now completed and a works list developed, the decision to complete the purchase was made and the vessel departed Bergen for Orkney yesterday morning, Thursday.On arrival, the vessel was handed over to Orkney Islands Council, but due to Covid- restrictions and the need for some works to be carried out to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication, it will be a while yet before the residents of Papa Westray are able to benefit from their new passenger ferry.The purchase of the new vessel was part funded by the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland.More details in The Orcadian Marine Scene section next week.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For urban wildle, which includes mammals and birds living alongside people in towns, this will affect levels of disturbance from humans and food availability.In recent weeks there have already been reports of animals adapting to the reduced human activity including Kashmiri goats roaming around Llandudno, North Wales, troops of monkeys in Singapore, wild boars in cities across Europe and Coyotes wandering streets during daylight hours in the US.Lead researcher Professor Dawn Scott, an expert in Mammal Ecology and Conservation, will use this unprecedented time to try to collect information and answer the study’s overarching question # How have urban animals responded to changes in human activity during the COVID- lockdown The research will collect records on any observations of unusual animal behaviour during the lockdown, determine the effects of reduction in human activity in city and town centres on urban wildle, and the effects increased human activity in gardens and outdoors space is having. The data from the survey will then be combined with other data from media searches to produce a report on the response of urban animals to lockdown across the globe.Professor Scott, head of the School of Le Sciences at Keele University, said: “Urban animals have been able to adapt to our landscape and live alongside towns, cities and suburbs so we know they are already highly adaptable. This flexibility in behaviour means they can usually quickly respond to changing conditions, including the absence of humans, which is happening during the lockdown.“Across the world we have seen reports of animals roaming cities and in locations that they wouldn’t normally be seen during the day. Social isolation is an opportunity for many to learn more about nature and how we can support it. We’re asking people to take part in our study and help us discover how urban animals are responding due to our change in behaviour.”To find out more and take part in the study visit: www.keele.ac.uk wildlestudycopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

However I have no idea how I can add my contribution. Ryan can you help me out here and publish the link in the Shetland Times mailto:NTIMailbox@ofgem.gov.ukIt is not unreliablestored. This technology exists. If we simply used the electricity to generate hydrogen, and store it just like the old city gas, we can run all our power needs through hydrogen fuel cells. Simple, cheap and clean. Or we could let global heating destroy our children#s future because nobody wants to see a big windmill near their property. I#m old enough not to care.To give a hand to each.#To leave the oyster-bed.#The sun#s shining here and like the old oyster, I can#t be bothered, either, John. Have a nice evening, do.Love it, thanks JT 🙂No real need for fuel cells. Hydrogen was % of coal gas, can be stored in gasometers and burnt in gas fires and used to power piston engines, gas turbines and most conventional heating systems. A hell of a lot cleaner than burning wood chip. Now forget the windfarms, obsolete technology, use tidal generation and mini modular nuclear.That way we will have a living planet worth saving, not a mass of concrete, steel and fibreglass.I#m not sure windfarms are quite obsolete yet# with the technology that is available at scale onshore wind is the cheapest source of new electricity. Perhaps not on peat bogs though. That#s not to say we can#t do better with other renewables.PS circa Dads Army, I am not that old!!!At  dollars a barrel so called renewables will need to reduce costs by a huge margin to compete with oil. At the current oil price of less that  dollars a barrel wind, tidal and solar no hope.Renewable energy is not produced in barrels. Where did you hear that We continue to burn oil and gas because the infrastructure is there and the investment has been made. But when it comes to investing in new electricity generation, onshore wind is the cheapest. Also # I am not sure how such a low price is beneficial to the oil industry what with their high fixed costs As a patriotic Brit I am all for us standing on our own two feet and generating cheap and reliable energy. Shetland aside, as a nation we are net importers of oil and gas. Why rely on the likes of Russia or our Middle Eastern friends when we can spend that money at home and have jobs for Brits producing clean and plentul energy  Let#s stop living in the s. Let#s have clean, reliable British energy instead.I tend to lean in the direction indicated by John Thomas.For reasons of cheapness , safety and reliability I can’t see why wind and tidal forces should not be the primary options for energy generation. Winds are unlikely to stop blowing and sea tides are unlikely to dry up , so how can they not be major considerations Nuclear power is also in the running provided that the associated risks can be accepted. No matter what the no doubt wellintended may suggest, there ARE risks which do not raise their ugly heads with wind and water. Reliable , sustainable , and non polluting.

I tried keeping them in all day but I ended up with an ear infection.I tried noise-reduction headphones – very expensive – but anything to keep out that incessant -decibel shrieking.I even tried wearing them whilst gardening and playing an early Queen album at full volume: “Sheer Heart Attack” – that should drown it out,it doesn’t give me one …What next I was so sensitive, or to give it its psychological name – “sensitised” – that I could even pick out the faintest suggestion of a chaffinch on a TV programme.It might be while watching the golf or some Jane Austen adaptation with a scene near some trees – and that blooming chaffinch was there in the background. Why doesn’t anybody  notice it What next  What next to do  Chop all the trees down around the house, down to ground level – that’s what next to do.And so I take an axe and like a deranged lumberjack, I fell every Sitka spruce within earshot.I cut down the white fuchsia to within feet of the ground, and the sessile oak and the sycamores and the rowan and the Swedish whitebeam – the lot, all down to within a few feet of the ground.That should do it. Just tell everyone it’s to give the deciduous trees more space, and the coppicing of what’s left will make them grow all the stronger.And then, next spring – all potential perching sites cleared from near the house….but the traffic!You open the door and there is a car stopped, looking at us and we look out of the window and there is a car stopped looking back at us….What a state to be in!Quick – replant some mature trees to provide an instant screen. The Christmas trees from past years with root balls still intact – they should do it and that escallonia and the New Zealand holly – evergreens to block the view of the road.This is madness. One month I am cutting down all the trees the next month I’m desperate to put them back!There is humour here.Someone calls when the trees have disappeared only to find that when next they visit, just months later, the trees are back again – some fully grown.Complete amazement: “Things don’t half grow fast here!”Thankfully, it’s an episode from the distant past.Time is a great healer I gradually managed to rewire my brain circuits and become habituated to the noise of the chaffinch.I can laugh at it now, but it shows how fragile and vulnerable the human mind can be.And so to the news that’s on everyone’s mind – coronavirus.As someone over , I am trying to minimise the risk of catching it and passing it on. Self-isolating is a daunting prospect and who knows how long this lockdown will last and what the future will bring I am reminded of that classic story from : “The Monkey’s Paw” by WW Jacobs. “Without, the night was cold and wet … ‘Hark at the wind … Path’s a bog and the road’s a torrent.”Gosh! This is far too close to home.The tale has been adapted many times for radio, television, film and theatre, and the full short-story text is available on the Internet.In the present circumstances it would be in poor taste to dwell on the details.Suffice it to say, the message is a salutary one, beginning with the anonymous quote: “Be careful what you wish for, you may receive it.”As I sit here in this eerie quietness – no more tourist traffic rumbling by and stopping outside our gateway – I cannot escape the jarring irony.The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ben-ak-wind-farm.jpg","title":"renewables firm launches support fund for north west skye","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHouseholds in North West Skye will be able to access grants of up to £ to help them through the coronavirus crisis thanks to a new major pledge from a renewable energy firm.has announced a fund for the communities around its windfarms to help alleviate the impact of the Covid- outbreak.The company is donating £, to be shared between the community benefit trusts which administer funds from its  wind farms in Scotland, England and Wales.Jason Bold, Chair of Dunvegan Community Trust who administer the funding from Ben Aketil Wind Farm, said: “Whilst we navigate these challenging circumstances in our rural community, Falck Renewables Covid- grant has offered us much needed funds to collaborate with local groups.#Dunvegan Community Council has been very responsive and progressive to set up a Community Fund, which we are proud to back with Falck’s kind support.”The Trust has joined forces with Dunvegan and District Community Council to establish a community fund offering financial support to anyone in the community council area experiencing financial hardship due to the Covid  virus.Grants will be generally given to support immediate needs and be limited to £ per household.The community fund will be facilitated and regulated by Skye and Lochalsh Citizens Advice Bureau.John Laing, chair of Dunvegan and District Community Council, said: “The Dunvegan Community Council are aware of the dficulties many iniduals and families are experiencing during these exceptional times.#We have launched the Dunvegan Community Fund to assist those in our community who are in need of assistance as a result of the Covid  virus and are delighted to have generous support of The Dunvegan Trust and Falck Renewables whose generous support have made our fund possible”Managing Director of Falck Renewables UK, Richard Dibley, said: “We have a close relationship with the communities around our wind farms and their response to the current challenging situation has been as proactive and heartwarming as we would have expected.#They are already involved in helping the people and organisations in their area who need it most and we were keen to support them.”Dunvegan Community Trust has also made a £, donation to the Skye and Lochalsh Community Food Bank.Food bank chair Davina McCluskie said: “We are very grateful for the grant from the Dunvegan Community Trust which will go a long way in helping those in need.  We have seen an increase in users at the foodbank and I fear we will see many more in the coming weeks.#We have no paid members on the food bank committee #

But some students at the South Eastern Regional College#sanimal management course have taken on some rather unusual friends into their homes.The animals usually live in the college#s Animal House but since lockdown they have had to move out and in with the students.Julie Armstrong, animal management lecturer, said: We have a whole array of creatures who live in SERC#s Animal House, giving our students hands on handling, observation and care access to everything from mice and rats to Guinea pigs, geckos and a tortoise.She continued: When we put the call out to see who could take on responsibility for looking after the animals, we were delighted with the enthusiasm and support from the students and indeed one of our animal technicians who took on our  resident mice.Mother-of-four Leanne Reid from Newtownards, whose children are aged from three to , is a first year student on the course. Her house is no stranger to animals - but now she has taken on even more.Leanne said: My house is a bit of a menagerie in any case as we already have four rats, two dogs and a cat, so taking on the three College rats, Butch, Marcellus and Joules, didn#t seem like too big an ask.We are all passionate about animals and the kids love having the new rats who have settled in well.I know some people are probably cringing about the thought of having any kind of rat as a pet but I have kept them since I was in high school - I used to take them to the local shop with me on my shoulder.They are really like having a wee dog and have their own little personalities and once they are out of their cages they settle down and are well behaved. They do like to be out and about.She added: As a mature student ing to education, I have been really thankful for all the support and encouragement that the lecturing and support staff have given me, so I have been delighted to be able to help out by offering to look after the animals in this way.Fellow student Nathan McKee, from Bangor, has taken on a couple of African Clawed Frogs.While Robyn Woods, also from Bangor, has brought home a couple of crested geckos and Norman the tortoise.She said: I feel privileged to have been able to take them in and provide them with a warm holiday home while supporting the college during lockdown.Hermione and Jason, the college Guinea pigs, have taken up residence with Naomi Perry from Newtownards.Meanwhile Laura Leabody, animal technician at SERC, has taken on  mice.She said: Having the mice home during this challenging time has provided excellent quality time in terms of handling and behavioural observations.New behavioural records have now been completed based on nocturnal activity which is something I wasn#t able to do before and I am looking forward to sharing these with the students during the online lessons.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Tony Holohan said they were one of the measures we are giving consideration to.Foyle MP Mr Eastwood, however, called on Stormont to follow Scotland#s example and advise people to wear face masks or coverings in enclosed public spaces where social distancing is dficult.It#s important that people are provided with the best advice to help them contribute to the effort to prevent further transmission of Covid- and help save lives, he said. The Scottish Government has now issued clear advice that members of the public should wear face masks in enclosed spaces where social distancing is unavoidably dficult to achieve, like in small shops.Our Executive should consider offering the same advice to people in Northern Ireland, the vast majority of whom are abiding by lockdown restrictions and want to help beat this outbreak. It#s no silver bullet, but it will help prevent transmission where people are in close contact. We have all experienced worry in enclosed spaces when people are unintentionally closer together than they#d like to be. Masks or coverings will help.Northern Ireland#s Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said any benefit from wearing face coverings would be marginal at the very least.What we must not lose sight of is the important message thatyou are symptomatic, you and your entire family need to self isolate. That is the most important point. It#s hugely important that we still adhere to the guidance to stay at home and only in limited circumstances should you leave your home, he added. The most important thing to do when you leave home is to adhere to the advice on physical distancing and on good respiratory and hand hygiene.Wearing a mask must not be seen as a substitute for adhering to that advice. There is some limited evidence thatyou are in an enclosed space and unable to adhere to the advice on social distancing, the wearing of some form of face covering may be of benefit, but the benefit is marginal, to say the very least.The recommendation on face masks issued by Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Tuesday appears to contradict earlier advice from Scotland#s national clinical director. Professor Jason Leitch said on April : The global evidence - and we#ve looked properly, I promise you - is that masks in the general population don#t work. People don#t wear them properly, they#re hard, they#re dficult and they#re uncomfortable.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, the Department of Health said it was committed to developing a fair and effective scheme for providing le assurance.But Dr Tom Black said the scheme announced by Health Secretary Matt Hancock means certain groups of doctors will not receive their full pension entitlement in a move he described as penny-pinching by the Westminster government.He also said he was no longer willing to put forward doctors to work in Covid centres or wards because their family would not receive the usual entitlementsthey died.We will instead, and this is what we have been doing for the last month, we will put forward older doctors like me who are more at risk because governments won#t pay a pension to the widows of the younger doctors, that#s not acceptable, he said, speaking to the BBC#s Talkback programme.Dr Black said that when the Covid pandemic emerged all healthcare workers stepped into the breach.Nobody hesitated, there were problems with PPE, we took it on the chin and kept working, he said.He claimed doctors will now be disadvantagedthey die in those circumstances after normally expecting to receive double their annual pay and approximately half their pension. Certain groups of doctors such as GP locums or people who are out of the pension scheme, retired members who came back or very young doctors who are in the first two years of their career, those groups will not get that.We#re basically saying to their widow, widower or their children, do you know what, there#s  grand but you won#t get the pension rights that you would normally get in these circumstances.Now that#s not a kick in the teeth, that#s a terrible insult to the profession who stepped up in this circumstance. That#s really not acceptable, it#s penny-pinching from the Treasury in London, he said.In a further comment to the Belfast telegraph, Dr Black said: Scotland is offering standard death in service payments to those in that situation, but what is being proposed by Matt Hancock is a single one-off payment that would leave families without an ongoing pension. In the best case no-one would ever need to access this fund, but some doctors’ families might. In particular younger doctors who have not joined the pension scheme, those who have answer the call tofrom retirement to assist with the pandemic, locum doctors who do not have a fixed employer and those who may have opted out of the pension scheme. We know that our Minister is still weighing up how best to use this funding in Northern Ireland and we would strongly urge that it is a full death in service benefit not a single payment. Our frontline doctors and their families deserve nothing less.Speaking on Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them.“Financial worries should be the last thing on the minds of their families so in recognition of these unprecedented circumstances we are expanding financial protection to NHS and social care workers delivering publicly funded care on the frontline.“We will continue to strive night and day to provide them with the support and protection they need and deserve to keep them safe as they work tirelessly to save lives.”A Northern Ireland department of Health statement said the health minister was considering which model represents the best fit for Northern Ireland and which most equitably reflects the important contributions being made for our health service.Dferent approaches are being taken in dferent UK regions and the Minister will reach decision shortly, having examined the dferent options.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk bde .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dbaadd--e-d-dbcc_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UKWhen will I be able to hug my close family, gran asks ministersA grandmother has askedhugging close family will be one of the first steps out of lockdown, in the first question from the public at the Downing Street coronavirus press conference. \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ecedcb-bbe--a-daa_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"CoronavirusNHS to restart vital services including cancer careThe NHS will restart some vital services, including cancer care, from today, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said, as he admitted the government has a lot of work to do to hit its , a day testing target. ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

First Minister Arlene Foster said the collective effort is ‘far from over’. Northern Ireland is still in a ‘critical moment’ during the first wave of the pandemic, she explained, and with one misstep the country faces the prospect of the virus reproduction rate going back above one – increasing the spread. She added: “Now is not the time for government and businesses to gamble with peoples’ lives, we need to proceed cautiously and ensure that we’re doing everything we can to prevent another spike from occurring.” googletag.cmd.push Governments around the world are ‘wrestling’ with the dilemma of ‘when is the right time to lt restrictions’, she said. The press conference heard that the decision to open cemeteries was criteria led and based on scientic advice. “The Executive will continue that on every decision we reach relating to COVID- but you also, the greater Northern Ireland community, have a role to play,” the DUP leader said. She acknowledged efforts made by the public through social distancing and isolation and recognised that people want to leave the confines of their homes. But added: “Now is not the time for impatience to get the better of us. No-one should act ascoronavirus has been beaten, it hasn’t, and we still have some way to go. googletag.cmd.push “If people go back to gathering in large numbers in public spaces andthey do not listen to the guidance on social distancing then they run the risk of another spike. “Having come so far in containing this disease it would be more than just a crying shame to undo that collective effort, it would be catastrophic for families, for communities and for a society as small as Northern Ireland’s.” The DUP leader referred to the speech made by Boris Johnson this morning when he said that thought must be given to ‘relaxation’, the path plotted carefully andthe government moves too fast it may be forced to ‘slam on the brakes’ again. Arlene Foster said: “That’s not what we want to do and we can’t afford to get too far ahead of ourselves.” She reiterated the point that the government would be led by scientic and medical advice and urged people to stay at home when possible. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said it is ‘disappointing’ to hear reports that some people have decided to relax restrictions themselves. “That kind of attitude is wrong, it is reckless and it is endangering live. Until a vaccine is found it means that we must co-exist with this virus. “And that means a radical change to how we live our daily lives for some time. For the most part people have been making personal sacrices for that greater good. And thank you for that. “But we must keep going, we must save lives. There is light at the end of the tunnel, there certainly is light, but we need to keep doing what we’re doing now in order to save lives and help our healthcare staff cope in our healthcare system.” She praised the public and health workers and welcomed news of pound.m of additional support for care homes which will help with additional staff to care for those in isolation and enhanced cleaning. LOCKDOWN Restrictions will be reviewed up until May  but Arlene Foster again asked people to be patient. In terms of contact tracing, a pilot is starting here this week and an App is being developed. Meanwhile, Michelle O’Neill welcomed the British government stance, ‘albeit late’, of test, trace isolate - a policy endorsed by the World Health Organisation . “The countries which have been most effective are those that have moved on this very quickly. “Contact tracing needs to be rolled out right across the community because that is part of our success in being able to counter the position that we could find ourselves in later where,you’re facing a second wave of this, that our ability to stop that will come down to how effective we are in contact tracing,” Sinn Feacutein’s Vice President added. She encouraged people to ‘keep doing what we’re doing’ as it has ‘proven effective’. DEATH TOLL Michelle O’Neill gave a figure of  deaths -  announced in total by the Public Health Agencybased on figures provided by health trusts – but said NISRA statistics would bring it up to . When questioned about Sinn Feacutein leader Mary Lou McDonald’s comments that the pandemic is an ‘accelerant’ for a united Ireland, Ms O’Neill said an all-island approach to health ‘makes sense’ and is not a political point. “We live on an island and it’s a natural advantage so it’s important we use that.” While Ms Foster said her priority is saving lives and it’s ‘regrettable’ that other leaders are ‘naval gazing’ at this time. The southern government is planning to publish a report outlining a strategy for the easing of restrictions. When probed about Northern Ireland’s own lockdown exit strategy the First Minister did not indicatethat would happen in the North or indeed provide any timeframe. Michelle O’Neill added that talk of relaxation feeds into public discourse before reinforcing the government’s key message for people to stay at home.

In an ideal world, they would have received detailed scrutiny at the Assembly before becoming law. However, we are not living in an ideal world at present. The overriding priority at this time is protection of le. Regulations to enforce and encourage social distancing have a vital role to play in that regard. These regulations were introduced by the Department of Health, with support from all Executive Ministers. Responsibility for enforcing them rests with the Police. Regulations are never going to cover all potential aspects of human interaction and behaviour in a modern society. There will inevitably be some shades of grey. That’s the reality of le. The Police have rightly made clear that officers will apply a “reasonableness” test on occasions when decidingsome behaviours may breach the regulations. googletag.cmd.push The overriding principle in applying any reasonableness test is not what may be reasonable for people to want to do, but what is reasonable in achieving the aim of preventing the spread of the Covid- virus, balanced with other risks and considerations. Officers applying discretion are a regular feature of modern day policing. Discretion is by its nature case specic. Ultimately, any decisions can be challenged through the courts to determinethe “reasonableness” test has been correctly applied in all the circumstances. It should also be noted that people will routinely be given the option of complying with any requirement tohome without the need for any penalty to be imposed. Thankfully, the vast majority of people across our community are supportive and co-operative with these emergency measures. googletag.cmd.push Whilst understanding people’s desire for clarity in what constitutes an offence under the regulations, it is not always possible to give inidual answers for the countless hypothetical scenarios which may arise. Notwithstanding this, the public health guidance is clear: stay home and only leave home when it is essential. For our part, we are deeply concerned that the current discourse may serve to undermine public confidence in the overall regulations, and encourage some people to ignore the strong guidance from the NI Executive with potentially devastating consequences.

Adele Heaney has been working in the Covid- centre at the Mater Hospital in Belfast after being redeployed from the Royal Victoria Hospital to combat the outbreak. The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Dungiven native recently featured in a BBC documentary called ‘First Time Doctors’ that revealed the realities of le as a recent graduate on a busy hospital ward. “The purpose of the show was to get an insight to what it’s like being a doctor for the first time and the trials and tribulations of le inside and outside of work,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “So many people just see the doctor and that side of things, so the show was quite nice as it showed a bit of le outside work. “Everyone has had that experience of being the ‘newbie’ in the job and having to learn how to do things in a fast-moving environment. “It was daunting having cameras following you around but the thing that we wanted to show was what it is like for us as doctors.” Coming the end of her second year as a doctor, Adele has found herself thrust onto the frontline of the worst pandemic since the  Spanish Flu which killed an estimated  million people. googletag.cmd.push Adele has pleaded with the public not to become complacent and praised the vocal support that has come from the #ClapForCarers campaign on Thursday nights. “The first week they did that I was very emotional, to be honest,” said Adele. “When you’re in the hospital and you’re doing a dficult job, having tough conversations and seeing people pass away, it’s nice to see people appreciate the sacrices you are making. “The public have been trying to do their best to go by what the guidelines have been telling us – social distancing and staying indoors. We have to keep going with what we’ve been told. “Everybody in the community has their part to play. Your part might just be staying in the house but that is so, so important to flatten the curve and for us to beat this together. “We’ve seen the news reports from Wuhan and Italy, and we’ve seen how devastating the disease can be, so it’s important that we protect ourselves to protect other people.” While tackling the pandemic represents a ‘steep learning curve’ Adele points out that all healthcare staff are coming from a similar position. She said: “Lots of my senior colleagues who have been in the profession for over  years have never experienced anything like this. “I don’t think there is anything in training that really can prepare you. We’ve had to adapt quite quickly to a new style of working. “Coming into work and wearing a mask all the time has been dficult, but we have some amazing senior colleagues who we’ve been able to learn from. “It’s been dficult whenever we’ve had to make phone calls to families about their relatives who are really unwell, you’re not able to have those face-to-face reactions like you normally would. “Learning on the job has been hard, but it’s very humbling to be part of that and to be there for their family members when they aren’t able to be.” Born and bred at the foot of Benbradagh, Adele has already set her sights on a speedywhen the coronavirus threat finally eases. “To be honest, the thing I’m looking forward to the most is being able to come back home to Dungiven and be able to see my family and my boyfriend again,” she said. “It is very dficult when you’re doing this when you are so far from home. We have this persona of doctor but when we come home from work, we like the same things as everyone . “People have made sacrices of moving out of their family homes and not seeing their children or husbands or wives, so people are looking forward to being reunited with their families. “That contact with people is probably the thing I’m looking forward to most, as I’m sure most people are.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Claire McMullan of Dental  in Magherafelt is currently volunteering at one of five Emergency Dental Treatment Hubs across Northern Ireland. The hubs were set up when a shortage in PPE made it impossible to supply every dental practice with the necessary equipment to carry out procedures safely. She told the County Derry Post: “From mid-March, we began postponing non urgent appointments. “This was to ease the number of patients coming through the practice as social distancing measures were introduced. By the end of that week we were treating emergency cases only. googletag.cmd.push “As dentists, dental hygienists and dental nurses work in such close proximity to our patients while carrying out these procedures, we are at very high risk of personal exposure. “In order to protect our teams, patients and the wider community it is vital that we have the correct PPE and decontamination protocol to keep the risk to an absolute minimum. “At present there is a drastic shortage in the required PPE for Aerosol Generating Procedures .” Almost every procedure in dentistry creates an aerosol when the use of a drill, ultrasonic scaler, water or compressed air propels droplets of saliva into the air. googletag.cmd.push In order to prevent transmission of Covid- through these droplets, the Health and Social Care Board ceased all AGPs and all consultations are now carried out by telephone. “All patients requiring advice or emergency treatment are asked to phone the practice so the dentist can triage their call,” Claire explains. “If they require a simple dressing or extraction, we may be able to offer this in practicethe patient is not isolating, experiencing Covid- symptoms or been in contact with anyone experiencing symptoms.” “We will offer advice or prescription where possible. If the patient requires an AGP, for example, to begin root canal treatment, they will be referred to the Urgent Dental Centre . After an initial request for  volunteers, over  dentists came forward to staff the emergency hubs, but many are yet to reach operational capacity. This is due to the time it takes to process such a big number of volunteers and fit them with the appropriate PPE. Claire said: “Some volunteers are still waiting to be fitted for their FFP masks. Every dentist must be specially fitted for an FFP mask to safely carry out AGP. “Any patient who requires an emergency AGP is referred to the hub where dentists work in pairs wearing full PPE plastic gown, FFP mask, cap, full face visor, apron and gloves. “With the current lovely weather, working in all the PPE, in a surgery with no air conditioning or open windows has been a challenge!” Given the usual high standard of cross infection control in dentistry, there are concerns for practices when the Covid- pandemic eventually begins to recede. Ato normal within dentistry will require the correct standard of PPE, and Claire says there are concerns in sourcing and fitting the equipment, as well as how it will be funded. She said: “Our main concern is the urgent need for PPE so we can carry out normal dental treatment. “I think treatments will be reintroduced gradually to general dental practice. The Hubs will continue towhile the reintroduction is happening and there is a demand. “We will have to organise our diaries and treatments dferently to limit exposure, allow for more efficient use of PPE and leave time between appointments for settling and cleaning. “We are acutely aware of the effect Covid- limitations have on the population. Necessary treatment is being postponed and dental conditions are potentially worsening as a result. “It is vital that we get appropriate guidance, PPE and financial support to start caring for the population’s dental health as safely and quickly as possible.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The current coronavirus pandemic means that all schools across the city are currently closed but last year the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School.  The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained Integrated status in  and is the only Integrated school on the West Bank of the city. A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and new Education Minister Peter Weir at the beginning of this year. googletag.cmd.push Now, in a statement to the Derry News a spokesperson for the Department of Education said: “As a result of the COVID- emergency situation Area Planning activity has largely been paused, with available resources deployed in support of the Department’s emergency response to COVID-. “The school will be advised as soon as any decision has been made, however an exact timeframe for a decision cannot be given at this time.” The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. googletag.cmd.push Following that decision numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. One parent, Diana McLaughlin, previously told the Derry News that uncertainty surrounding the school’s future and looming transfer tests meant she had to take the ‘dficult decision’ to move her son and daughter where. The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. ‘DISAGREE’ A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the waterside. It caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school. And says in addition there are more than two year groups within a classroom as the school operates as a three teacher school. EA therefore recommends that Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School discontinues with effect from  August .

The call for the loud voice from the city came from SDLP Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin. “I am angry and frustrated,” she said. “Our city has been waiting far too long for the expansion of Magee – half a century, in fact. But it has also been waiting an absurdly long time for the Medical School to get the go-ahead. And this remains the case, even though the SDLPs leader Colum Eastwood secured additional money from the UK government as part of the New Decade, New Approach agreement. googletag.cmd.push “It is time for the Department of Health, Department for the Economy and Department of Finance, and their ministers, to end this game of pass the parcel – or pass the blame – and make the decision to approve the Medical School and deliver it. The people of Derry have now run out of patience and we have all nearly run out of time to get this over the line. “It is obvious that we need the Medical School in Derry. We have a chronic shortage of doctors in the North West. The establishment of the Medical School will help to put that right. googletag.cmd.push “Many people owe their lives to the work of medical professionals over recent weeks. But the truth is that we need more of them. Let us treat the medical profession with respect, by recognising their work and the risks they have taken, by paying them properly, by providing sufficient personal protection equipment for their needs and by training enough doctors and other health professionals to do the job that we expect them to do. “So I say to the people of Derry, please come together and shout as loud as you can to tell the political leaders and senior civil servants of Northern Ireland that they must this time do the right thing and give the go-ahead for the Magee Medical School.” People of Derry and the rest of the north can respond to the call by sending emails to politicians, as well as sharing social media posts, using the hashtag #MedicalSchoolforDerry. Sinead McLaughlin is deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s economy committee and intends to raise at today’s meeting of the committee the need for an urgent, positive, decision on the Medical School.

There was no substitute for the excitement. It lit a flame that still burns to this day. He squeezed every drop from a playing career that also saw him play three seasons in England and bank a letime of memories. His knees eventually told him enough was enough and when Crusaders changed their mind on an operation, it was time to take stock.“It was too much money and I was over . They were not going to take a chance and you couldnt really blame them,” Jim recalls.His football career was far from finished. Like when Stoke chose not to renew his contract, Jim McGroarty was at a footballing crossroads. But he was far from finished.He would later manage Limavady United. Before that, the Lettershandoney native steered Dungiven Celtic to nine trophies during the clubs golden era.When Patsy McGowan signed McGroarty, for Sligo Rovers on hisfrom Stoke, he would play in the League of Ireland on a Sunday, after managing Dungiven - where he now lived - on a Saturday.It was a hectic time. They trained on Tuesday and Thursday nights, opposite Sligos Wednesday and Friday schedule.He managed the Ballyguddin side for best part of  years. The only blip came during his time playing in the Irish League, when mixing both, under the same governing body, wasnt permitted and the Dungiven reins were passed on to Brian Ward.Ward was one of three Briansto score in the clubs - win over Derry City to land the NW Intermediate Cup in  – their first trophy in intermediate football. “The boys must have drank for a week,” McGroarty remembers. The club had made the ambitious move to elevate themselves to intermediate football in . McGroarty is very grateful to them for putting him through his coaching badges. He holds an A licence, achieved over a year with visits to assess his progress.During the s, Dungiven lost three Intermediate Cup finals, but enjoyed two runs in the Irish Cup that included a - defeat at Crusaders.As a player, McGroarty lost an Irish Cup final with Glenavon, to a late Glentoran penalty in  and was on the Sligo Rovers team that fell - to Dundalk in the  FAI Cup Final in front of , fans.He tapped into this experience during Dungivens cup runs.“If we had a home tie. I would get boys in at nine oclock on a Saturday morning and go through all the set pieces,” he outlines.The players would then have breakfast together, all paid from their own pocket, before relaxing and ing to Ballyguddin for the game later in the day, with everything fresh in their mind.“It worked,” McGroarty feels. “You were playing the top teams from the amateur league in Belfast or the intermediate leagues in Ballymena.“A lot of the games were tight, the score was - and one of the set pieces you worked on that morning...you could get it in the last five minutes and somebody stuck the ball in the back of the net. You are trying to add a bit of professionalism.”On away days, the Dungiven players were asked to wear a collar and tie. It was about turning up at senior clubs, well-dressed. It was a statement of intent. googletag.cmd.push *** When you quiz Jim McGroarty on the secret to Dungiven Celtics success at the start of the millennium, the word modesty perfectly describes the unspoken narrative coming down the line. He plays down his role in the success that was to follow. In addition, he is not one for name-checking. Hed have to mention about  men. There is a genuine respect he has for the collective force the players delivered. They are not just words. The tone in his voice reinforces pride this era brought him. He is a football man through and through,After knocking on the door, silverware was a regular visitor to Dungiven during the s. Four intermediate leagues and cups were won under his watch.The breakthrough came with the   league title. The following season, they secured the double in a year to remember that saw the reserves and thirds win their respective leagues. McGroarty also remembers the generation before.“There were a hell of a lot of players over the years, who were really good footballers. They never won a league and some of them didnt even win a trophy,” he said.It was followed by a core of young players, who fused into a winning formula as the attitude began to change.“First of all, they wanted to play football. Second of all, they wanted to do well and thirdly, they wanted to play for Dungiven Celtic. When you put that together, you dont have a lot to do as a manager or a coach.” googletag.cmd.push  Jim managed Dungiven to their first Intermediate League title in   Even snow wasnt an obstacle in preparations. On one occasion, two balls were sent to a shop up the town to get sprayed and ed Massey Ferguson red, McGroarty recalls.“It allowed us to train away in the snow, thats the sort of commitment we had. We had a good bunch of lads, it took a few years and we built the team up and, apart from a couple, the rest of the players were from around the town.”Another important ingredient in Jims cocktail for success was having players battling for places. With  to  players jockeying for  jerseys, the manager had the players in the palm of his hand.“If you have a boy who plays for you on a Saturday, without caring how he plays because he knows he will be on the following weekend – thats never going to work.”“Even Seamus Harkin - who is now Chairman - and the younger boys at the time. They didnt want to go and play for the reserves. They wanted to be on the bench for the seniors and get a few minutes. Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

There was no substitute for the excitement. It lit a flame that still burns to this day. He squeezed every drop from a playing career that also saw him play three seasons in England and bank a letime of memories. His knees eventually told him enough was enough and when Crusaders changed their mind on an operation, it was time to take stock.“It was too much money and I was over . They were not going to take a chance and you couldnt really blame them,” Jim recalls.His football career was far from finished. Like when Stoke chose not to renew his contract, Jim McGroarty was at a footballing crossroads. But he was far from finished.He would later manage Limavady United. Before that, the Lettershandoney native steered Dungiven Celtic to nine trophies during the clubs golden era.When Patsy McGowan signed McGroarty, for Sligo Rovers on hisfrom Stoke, he would play in the League of Ireland on a Sunday, after managing Dungiven - where he now lived - on a Saturday.It was a hectic time. They trained on Tuesday and Thursday nights, opposite Sligos Wednesday and Friday schedule.He managed the Ballyguddin side for best part of  years. The only blip came during his time playing in the Irish League, when mixing both, under the same governing body, wasnt permitted and the Dungiven reins were passed on to Brian Ward.Ward was one of three Briansto score in the clubs - win over Derry City to land the NW Intermediate Cup in  – their first trophy in intermediate football. “The boys must have drank for a week,” McGroarty remembers. The club had made the ambitious move to elevate themselves to intermediate football in . McGroarty is very grateful to them for putting him through his coaching badges. He holds an A licence, achieved over a year with visits to assess his progress.During the s, Dungiven lost three Intermediate Cup finals, but enjoyed two runs in the Irish Cup that included a - defeat at Crusaders.As a player, McGroarty lost an Irish Cup final with Glenavon, to a late Glentoran penalty in  and was on the Sligo Rovers team that fell - to Dundalk in the  FAI Cup Final in front of , fans.He tapped into this experience during Dungivens cup runs.“If we had a home tie. I would get boys in at nine oclock on a Saturday morning and go through all the set pieces,” he outlines.The players would then have breakfast together, all paid from their own pocket, before relaxing and ing to Ballyguddin for the game later in the day, with everything fresh in their mind.“It worked,” McGroarty feels. “You were playing the top teams from the amateur league in Belfast or the intermediate leagues in Ballymena.“A lot of the games were tight, the score was - and one of the set pieces you worked on that morning...you could get it in the last five minutes and somebody stuck the ball in the back of the net. You are trying to add a bit of professionalism.”On away days, the Dungiven players were asked to wear a collar and tie. It was about turning up at senior clubs, well-dressed. It was a statement of intent. googletag.cmd.push *** When you quiz Jim McGroarty on the secret to Dungiven Celtics success at the start of the millennium, the word modesty perfectly describes the unspoken narrative coming down the line. He plays down his role in the success that was to follow. In addition, he is not one for name-checking. Hed have to mention about  men. There is a genuine respect he has for the collective force the players delivered. They are not just words. The tone in his voice reinforces pride this era brought him. He is a football man through and through,After knocking on the door, silverware was a regular visitor to Dungiven during the s. Four intermediate leagues and cups were won under his watch.The breakthrough came with the   league title. The following season, they secured the double in a year to remember that saw the reserves and thirds win their respective leagues. McGroarty also remembers the generation before.“There were a hell of a lot of players over the years, who were really good footballers. They never won a league and some of them didnt even win a trophy,” he said.It was followed by a core of young players, who fused into a winning formula as the attitude began to change.“First of all, they wanted to play football. Second of all, they wanted to do well and thirdly, they wanted to play for Dungiven Celtic. When you put that together, you dont have a lot to do as a manager or a coach.” googletag.cmd.push  Jim managed Dungiven to their first Intermediate League title in   Even snow wasnt an obstacle in preparations. On one occasion, two balls were sent to a shop up the town to get sprayed and ed Massey Ferguson red, McGroarty recalls.“It allowed us to train away in the snow, thats the sort of commitment we had. We had a good bunch of lads, it took a few years and we built the team up and, apart from a couple, the rest of the players were from around the town.”Another important ingredient in Jims cocktail for success was having players battling for places. With  to  players jockeying for  jerseys, the manager had the players in the palm of his hand.“If you have a boy who plays for you on a Saturday, without caring how he plays because he knows he will be on the following weekend – thats never going to work.”“Even Seamus Harkin - who is now Chairman - and the younger boys at the time. They didnt want to go and play for the reserves. They wanted to be on the bench for the seniors and get a few minutes. Thats the type of young boys you had at the time.”Getting into the first team was all that mattered. And McGroarty was beginning to get a kick out of management, as the trophies began to roll in.“You train hard on a Tuesday night, you set your stall out on a Thursday night how you are going to play on a Saturday andyou see it all coming together in front of you, thats what being a coach and manager is all about.”With nine trophies to his name, he jokes about ato the club. “Maybe, Ill take it into double figures,” he laughs.Jim McGroartys enthusiasm, even now, is infectious. *** Jim is the oldest of a family of four. Growing up, as a avid Manchester United supporter, he was infatuated with George Best. He donned the same boots and jersey, as he played around the fields of Slaughtmanus. “It couldve ended up -a-side,” McGroarty jokes. “If you werent quick or strong, you maybe touched the ball once. Parents were out at dark to get you into bed, for school the next morning.”He mixed soccer and Gaelic football for much of his career. One of the earliest memories was of winning a league, championship and nine carnival cups - all in one year - with the now defunct St Marys Mullaghbuoy.The newly formed St Marys Slaughtmanus won the  intermediate championship. Jim was on the team and managed them to the  final, a one-point defeat by Castledawson.He remembers coming on as a sub for Derry minors at Omagh in a - to - defeat to Armagh. McGroarty bagged - in a tempestuous encounter that saw him end up in hospital with a suspected broke nose. He wasnt on his own.“Harry Joe McWilliams was buried up against a post and Frankie Trainer had a broken nose, he was hit from behind.” Jim adds.When Derry won their second Ulster U title in , Jim was on the squad that included Joe Irwin, Gerry McElhinney, Colm McGuigan and Alfie Dallas.By then, his soccer career was beginning to develop.He first played competitively with Tamnaherin Youth Club in the Saturday morning league. At that time, he also played for Foyle Harps in the Summer Cups, which was growing in popularity with prizes up to pound, for the winning team.After impressing a - win over Buncrana in the final, at Maginn Park, he was spotted by Finn Harps and signed for the first of three times by Patsy McGowan.At the age of , Jims talents also attracted Glasgow Celtics scouts, but his -day trial was cut short by injury after a week.“I caught a boys studs and with a swollen foot, that was end of that trial. It was a great experience too...I played at Parkhead and at Ibrox.”At that time, the squad wouldve trained behind the goals at Parkhead.“There used to be a five-a-side,” McGroarty remembers. “Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain and Paul McStay were there. I got to play five-a-side with them, which was good.”By the time Stoke came calling, he was in a better place. The experience and lessons from Celtic were invaluable. He knew the level that was required. *** When McGroarty signed for Finn Harps, it was at the end of the  season. He got a handful of games, but he was stronger the following year and became a regular. At the end of the season, he played in an exhibition game for the Harps against an invitational select.”“I couldnt believe it...I was on the same pitch as Frank Stapleton, Liam Brady and Johnny Giles. I was nearly a full international team, but I didnt know that Stoke City were at the game and they asked me over for the trial.” This time he impressed and signed a one-year deal in October . Going over to unknown territory didnt come into the decision-making process. Jims decision was easy.“I wouldve swam over and I wouldve played for nothing. I always wanted to be a footballer.” McGroarty said, with an enthusiasm that hasnt dwindled over the years.“George Eastham was the Stoke manager and he scored the winner in the  League Cup final - over Cha...a lovely man.”McGroarty made his first team debut away to Oldham. At the team meeting in the hotel before the game, Eastham gave their new signing the responsibility to marshal the defence on any Oldham free kicks outside the box.“Can you line the wall ” the manager asked.“I can boss, I used to be a bricklayer,” was Jims instinctive answer, and he remembers the rest of the team killing themselves in laughter.When McGroarty later went to apologise, Eastham was having none of it.“You dont need to apologise. I like boys with a bit of character,” he said.Playing professional football was a dream, but a step up in class.“When you go to training every day, you cant be taking your foot off the pedal or looking over your shoulder,” Jim explains.“You have to knuckle down, the boy beside you is looking for your jersey and up the line, you are looking for somebodys jersey.”During McGroartys time at Stoke, there was a change of manager, as Eastham was replaced by Alan Durban. He brought Howard Kendall in as player coach.“Kendall was the best player I played alongside,” states McGroarty, of the man who would lead Everton to First Division , FA Cup and European Cup Winners Cup honoursJims contract was renewed every season for three years, before he was given the bad news that his time at the club was over.“When the last contract was up, they didnt resign me. There was not a lot of security in it. It is a rat race, you have to accept it and not rest on your laurels - you have to get on with it,” he said.“I wasnt back in Ireland two days until Patsywas on the phone and signed me at Sligo Rovers and I would then move back to Ballybofey when he later joined Finn Harps.”By the mid-s, Derry City moved from the Irish League to join the League of Ireland. The Candystripes expressed an interest in snapping up McGroarty, be he declined.“I didnt go back to the League of Ireland. I was scundered with the travelling. Youd have to go Derry for training and even when I was with Finn Harps, it was like an away game.“If you went to Waterford or Cork, it was an overnight stay in those days, but you had  players packed into a -seater minibus. If you were lucky, you got a seat andnot, you are lying on top of the kit-bags.”It was time for a change. His three years at Glenavon saw him come close to winning a cup, but they lostto Glentoran. Defender Andy Russell clawed a ball off the line with his hand and Jim Cleary dispatched his spot-kick to the top corner of the net.“I missed a sitter in that game,” McGroarty recalls. After Glenavon, he moved to Crusaders for the final leg of his career. Eventually, the knocks caught up with him and injury forced his hand.It was time to plough all his energy into Dungiven Celtic. Once a competitor, always a competitor. And the players bought into his philosophy of management. His experience, coupled with his desire for success, was the catalyst for what was to follow. With nine titles to his name in his time as manager with Dungiven Celtic, would heto make it the perfect  “Never say never,” he concluded.

He was impressionable. In September, he was listening intently to the wireless, as Derry launched their first bid for Sam Maguire. He wasnt just reliant on the radio waves to savour the magic. Twice a week, the Derry team would train in nearby Newbridge and he got to meet his heroes. Where the towns Credit Union now resides, John Joe Diamonds cafe was located on Bellaghys Castle Street. Tommy, now  years of age, vividly remembers the scene as his mother Cathy made plates of sandwiches for the players before they ed home, to the four corners of the county. googletag.cmd.push “When you get the county stars in your kitchen twice a week, I got to know them all well and I was friendly with them through the years,” Diamond begins. Sean OConnell would later train the Derry teams that Diamond would captain to All-Ireland glory. “I played with him too, hiscareer lasted a brave while...he mustve been  when he was still playing with Derry,” Diamond adds. When Bellaghy All-Ireland winning manager Harry Cassidy took charge at county level, he called Diamond into the senior  in the early s. He was part of the team that toured New York and Connecticut. googletag.cmd.push “We went out to play exhibition matches out there. It was an experience to get out there. We also won the Wembley Tournament two years in a row.” The semi-finals were played in the iconic stadium, with the final played out in New Eltham. “I was taking a look the other day and I think I have played in every county in Ireland,” Diamond added, of a county career that ended in . But it was the s, when he left his greatest imprint. *** In , Tommy was on Bellaghys first county U championship winning team and was a minor champion three years later. At county level, Derry minors had yet to reach an Ulster final. The first of Diamonds three years in the county minor team began in the closing stages of a game in Dungiven, with Antrim in the lead. “I remember being threw on as a late sub and two balls were kicked right over the full-back,” he recalls. “They landed in my hands and all I had to do was to kick them into the net and I think we won by a point.” After another season of consolidation, a place in the final again eluded them, but there was a crux of a team still eligible for . “We knew from , we had a good  and we didnt lose many,” said Diamond, who was made captain. When Derry defeated Tyrone, Donegal and Fermanagh on their way to the  minor league final, they did so without the St Columbs Derry players who focussed on winning the MacRory and Hogan Cups, under the management of former Fermanagh player Fr Ignatius McQuillan, just four years after tiptoeing onto the Ulster Colleges scene. “Then seven or eight of them came onto the Derryteam – which was some help,” Diamond added. “FrShields was the man who put the backbone into us and Sean , he put all the final touches to us, he was a great trainer.  Sean OConnell, Tommy Diamond and Fr Seamus Shields with the Tom Markham Cup “We trained twice a week up in Ballinascreen and after training we went into Timoneys for sandwiches and milk every night.” Aside from the medals and success, Diamond is grateful for the memories and friendships built up, that stood the test of time. “If any of us ever meet each other, it is a half day session. Thats the great thing about it.” They hammered Donegal in the  first round, in Dungiven, but the win came at a cost with a knee injury to Chris Brown. In the semi-final it was a dferent story and it was a narrow - to - win over Down, a game that saw Phil Friel sustain three fractured ribs. “We beat Cavan in the final in Clones,” Diamond remembers. “It was a hard, dour match and a typical Cavan match with hard hitting and not a lot of finesse about it.” Derry were Ulster champions and with the Hogan Cup now in the county, there was an air of quiet confidence as the squad headed to Croke Park. Diamonds first memory of their epic semi-final with Roscommon was giving the referee his name. “I was marking Dermot Early that day and we got booked after  seconds,” he laughs. “It was some start to a semi-final. I caught the ball and as soon as I caught the ball, he hit me. He was about two seconds late, I hit him with an upper cut and put him on the broad of his back and both of us were booked.” Derry were - to - winners and with the game in the melting pot in the second half, Early pulled a penalty wide of the posts when the Rossies were four points in arrears. “The great Miacutecheaacutel Oacute Muircheartaigh was commenting and he called it the game of the golden goals. Every one of them was hit in from  yards, absolute screamers.” It was time for one last push. Derry had one hand on the Tom Markham Cup. So too had Kerry. *** The Kingdom had the breeze and thanks to some wastefulness in Derrys attack, Kerry were a point ahead at the break. Sean OConnells pep talk worked wonders and the cogs began to turn. Tommy Diamond and Seamus Lagans performance at midfield helped them to a - to - win. “I dont remember an awful about it.” Diamond says. Earlier in the day, GAA President Alf Murray asked himhad his speech prepared with the customary lines of Irish, should Derry win. “I had no Irish, so he penned out the speech with the phonetics and I tucked it into the pocket of my shorts”. The speech mustve slipped out during the game and as he stood on the presentation podium, Diamonds pocket was empty. “I am the first man to just speak in English, I dont think it went down to well but I just had to go ahead with it,” he continued. The team stayed out in Portmarnock on the Saturday and Sunday night. Just recently Donal Mullan, son of county official at the time Paddy, handed Diamond a ticket from the post-final banquet. “The entrance admission was just  shillings,” he added. The homecoming on the Monday took nearly six hours, with crowds coming out along the route to salute the new champions. There were bonfires as the team crossed the county border. On the final leg of the journey, the victory cavalcade of cars coming to Maghera streamed all the way back to Tobermore. The Brackaghreilly Pipe band led John Mulhollands decorated lorry up Maghera street. “I remember being up on the top of the cab. They had a seat and I was tied into it and held the cup,” Diamond proudly beams. “It was some occasion for the firstchampionship to come into Derry.” Two years later, with Diamond still as captain, Derry won the Ulster U title before getting trounced by Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final in Charlestown. “We were favourites for Ulster but we just werent ready for it ,” Diamond admits. “We were a year young and the next year we were all U and Sean OConnell was still in charge of us.” In , Derry swept all before them in Ulster, with only Down putting up any sort of resistance and Seamus McCloskeys - tally was enough to see off Monaghan in the final. Kerry came to Ballinascreen for the semi-final and trailed - to - at half-time, but had pegged the team back to a point midway through the second half. Diamond was switched to mark Brendan Lynch and a Kevin Teague goal helped swing the game in the home sides favour. Holders Mayo were shocked by Offaly in the other semi-final, setting up a Croke Park meeting with Derry. The Oaks led by nine points at the interval with the Faithful County down to -men after the dismissal of Eugene Mulligan, before easing to victory. He was the first player to captain his county to minor and U All-Ireland titles. But for Diamond,  was far from over. Despite playing three years for Derry minors, it took Diamond time to break into the Bellaghy senior team who would win seven titles during the s. He was dismissed, along with his brother Laurence, in the  semi-final win over Kilrea and missed the final. “Bellaghy had a strong  of players,” Diamond points out. “I only got my place on the senior team when Anthony Madden went to Australia and I got his place at right corner back.” There was nothing  only football and it is still the case. Karls son James is the first of his grandsons to play senior championship for the blues. The recent underage production line represents the hope in the new batch in the club. “They have the greatest facilities and have everything you would want and we have no team,” Diamond adds, referring to the -year gap since the John McLaughlin Cup rested in Bellaghy. “At that timewe had no facilities but we had teams....its a change of circumstances.” He picked up the third of eight senior medals in , but the Bellaghy adventure was only beginning. Once again, Diamond was involved in a first as the club were crowned Ulster champions in the first year of the competition. Frankie OLoane scored - in a  point win over Pearses of Belfast in the first round and it was followed up by a victory over a Newry Mitchells side that hammered Bryansford in the Down decider, thanks to goals from Sean Lee and Tom Scullion. Bellaghy beat St Josephs in the final, a combination of Ballyshannon and Bundoran, played on December  in the falling snow. “They had Brian McEnf and about  county men in total. They had a strong side and they actually, by right, shouldve beat us, but we were that dogged that day,” Diamond states. “It was a really cold day and we got a bit of a lead up against them. It was a rearguard action against the breeze in the second half but we held out.” There was no All-Ireland series until  when East Kerry won the title. Bellaghy retained their Derry title with a win over Slaughtneil in  before losing the final the following year to Newbridge. When they bounced back, it took them to their finest hour. A - to - win over Lavey saw them win Derry title number . In Ulster, they defeated Ballybofey, Ardboe and Teemore before taking on Armaghs Clann na nGael in the Ulster final. A - to - interval lead put them on their way to a facile win. In the All-Ireland series, it was a dferent story and Frankie OLoane was twice their savour. Tommy Diamond, Hugh McGoldrick and Chris Brown led from the half-back line against Portlaoise, but it was OLoane who tied the game late on, before Hugh Donnelly scored the winner in a - to - win. In the final, they took on the might of UCC and once again it took OLoane, with his seventh point of the game, to level matters late on. When Hugh McGoldrick broke up a Cork attack, Brendan Cassidy went on to score and the Tones were crowned All-Ireland champions. “Theyhad  county players, they were from all around. Moss Keane was full-back, he was a big tower of a man but Tom Quinn was too much for him.”   All-Ireland club - Tommy is on the extreme left of the front row Later that night, Cassidys lorry ferried the team up and down Bellaghy street to a heros welcome. Absent was the cup, as East Kerry didntit. “It is the sort of thing they cant take away from you,” Diamond said, of achieving the pinnacle of club football. He would later turn to management and managed Derry for  months at the end of the s, but stepped down after he felt the County Board were not allowing him full control of the team. Before that, at the start of the  season, Bellaghy were unable to get a senior manager, so Diamond put his name forward. The Tones went seven seasons without a title and werent tipped for glory. “Nobody wanted to take it. A lot of these managers, unless theyare good they are not interested at all,” he said. After winning the Derry title, Diamond took his side to Crossmaglen for the opening game of Ulster. After a battle, Bellaghy came out on top, but lost in the next round by a point at home to Castleblayney. “We shot in and shot inand Blayney went on to beat Burren in the Ulster final. I went to it in Dungannon, it was a dour match, - to -,” Diamond recalls, as Burrens quest for four-in-a-row failed. ”I said I would take themas far as I can, there wasnt much hope for them. We got them going rightly and I was disappointed we didnt win an All-Ireland with that team. I felt they were good enough.” *** Another passion is golf. He has been member of Ballymena Golf Club for  years, where he still plays with lelong friend Gerry McCann. He has been a member of Moyola, where he is now the Ranger.  Tommy andSeve Ballesteros Another friend of Diamond, Willie Cassidy, pulled off a coup in  by bringing Seve Ballesteros to play a round at the course, just months after he won the Masters. “I think it cost pound, to bring him to Moyola, he was number one in the world and Willie got him,” Diamond adds. “It is the only course in the north of Ireland I think he played on and I had the honour of caddying for him, I was the lowest handicapper at the club. “I marked his card, he countersigned it and it is up in the clubhouse for ever more amen.” A letime of memories. Aside from the current lock-down, the chat continues every Thursday night over the winter. Tommy plays cards with friends and his sons. It is a ritual. The social hub and the legacy of parents John Joe and Cathys cafe continues. RELATED - Derrys path to their first taste of September. Click here...

They cant get enough credit. The leadership didnt faff about once Leo Varadkar signalled the need for a lock-down earlier this month. On a local level, clubs have rallied around their communities and provided direction on so many fronts. Last week they delivered the archive of All-Ireland finals to the world. What a brilliant gesture, following on from the terric coverage given by broadcaster TG. Struggling with the withdrawal from sport, for those who are fanatical about it, cannot be underestimated. Last week, it was great to take a look back at Derrys only All-Ireland title. Highlights aside, I havent watched the final - in full - since I was at school. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - All-Ireland final  Hammering Down in the first round was a statement of intent. A mauling that led Pete McGrath to admit, in the post-game interview, that Mourne fans deserved an apology. The gesture didnt sit well with the Down players. Monaghans Gerry Mone gave Derry a torrid time in the Ulster semi-final at Casement before Joe Brolly came from the bench to give the spark needed for victory. The Ulster final saw Damian Cassidy gracefully skating over the puddles in Clones, in a game the Derry players were going to win, come hell or high water. It took a late block by Tony Scullion on Manus Boyle and Brian McGilligans intervention to deny Donegal another goal chance, when they had crafted a two on one situation. googletag.cmd.push In the All-Ireland semi-final, it wasnt until Johnny McGurks wonder pressure point that Derry would eventually rest easy against the Dubs in the season-defining clash. Anthony Tohills outstretched arms of celebration before Joxers kick went over the bar will always stick in my mind. The branch of the Derry Supporters Shop at the top of Hall Street in Maghera was thronged with people in the lead-up to the final. There was so much expectation that Sam wouldon the Monday evening. In a powerful video interview with Shane Stapleton on #OurGame, Tony Scullion touched on how he felt the wave of emotion was almost congratulating them as they departed for the final. It was a Cork team that hammered a poor Mayo outfit in the semi-final, I thought. With hindsight and on watching the final, from someone outside the camp, the mental strength was Derrys greatest asset that day. Cork had nine players who had played in an All-Ireland senior final. They had played in five, winning two and losing twice, once after a replay. Derry, while being the upcoming team and having dispatched the  and  champions on their way, they were untested on the biggest day of the season. HAMMER BLOW From my position on the Hill that day, I can still see Joe Kavanaghs number  jersey cutting through the Derry defence before hammering past the advancing Damien McCusker. It was the first goal Derry had conceded since June , that sunny day in Castleblayney when Derry fans applauded Monaghan scoring their only point of the first half. In the second half, three Farney goals had Oakleafers shaking, before getting out with a draw. Kavanaghs goal brought me back to that day. Derry never do anything the easy way. Colin Corkery won the first two balls off Gary Coleman, John ODriscoll beat Tony Scullion to an early possession. Corks running game had Derry in all sorts of trouble. Fergal P McCusker and Henry Downey couldnt get to grips with Don Davis and Joe Kavanagh respectively. When Derry eventually went on an attack, Mark OConnor won the first battle with Seamus Downey. Derry were - to - in arrears. Was Derry going to fail the final hurdle again  Brian McGilligan then won a vital possession at midfield. It was small, yet massive. Later in the attack Damian Bartons trademark disguised hand pass - where he looked one way and gave the ball the other - found Johnny McGurk who fired over Derrys first point of the game. It took a series of Cork mistakes to swing the momentum. Teddy McCarthy dropped a routine pass from Niall Cahalane and McGilligan curled between the posts. The now dominant Tohill hoovered up a loose Teddy McCarthy pass before going on a storming run to win a free and Gormley slotted over. The Oaks were now only two points in arrears and growing in confidence. McGilligan turned the screw even tighter. John Kerins had been targetting Barry Coffeys height advantage over Johnny McGurk on his kick-outs. Across came McGilligan to win a ball he had no right to. It was inspirational. The big man launched a pass forward that eventually found Damian Cassidy. Cass swung a ball into the square. Seamus Downey made up the guts of  metres to take advantage of a mix-up between Kerins and OConnor, before punching to the net. Boom. Derry were on top. Heaney nearly beat Kerins to the ball for a further goal chance and, earlier, the Cork stopper made a brilliant save to deny Cassidy. Then referee Tommy Howard made two wrong calls. Cahalane buried Enda Gormley off the ball and got off with just a lecture. Seconds later, Tony Davis was harshly sent off for a lazy lunge at Dermot Heaney, with Howard gesturing the use of an elbow. It was the wrong call. The narrative was always that the punch woke Enda up. Thats harsh I feel. There was very little ball directed into his corner before that. Everything went thought Brolly. However, it lit a fire and Gormley went on to score six points. Derry twice led by three points and when Dermot McNicholl curled over, after the interval, it shouldve been the catalyst to push on. Brolly was toasting Brian Corcoran and shouldve been used more. John ODriscoll started the second half at wing forward, with Colin Corkery in on Tony Scullion. But when Don Davis inch-perfect pass took out the entire Derry defence, ODriscoll drilled to the net and Cork were ahead. Thats where the Derry resolve was again tested. And they passed. There was no sign of panic. McGurk was allocated the extra-man role. Fergal P McCusker, Henry Downey - and later McKeever – ran the show in defence. With the extra man, Damien McCuskers outfield experience saw him use short kick-outs before they were even invented. For all their control, they failed to ask any questions of Derrys defence, but when Gormley levelled the game, the Ulster champions superior fitness carried them into the three point lead. Even then, Derry did it the hard way. With Steven OBrien now at full-forward, Cork began to throw the dice for the last time. If every the term getting over the line was used, then this was all so relevant. Derry had performed better on other days during the Eamonn Coleman era, but winning was the only thing. Failure wasnt an option and they refused to be denied their moment of glory. It was richly deserved. Its just a pity there was no back door and that Eamonn was controversially sacked. This group had so much more to offer. RELATED - Sideline View wants Derry to fast forward.Click here...

The smiling photograph of the little girl in a First Communion dress was taken by former Derry Journal photographerLarry Doherty in the s. It lay uncollected in a box for many years until Larrys daughter, Moira Doherty, discovered it recently and posted it on Facebook in the hope of reuniting it with its owner. Tracy Morroi, who is a teacher at St Patricks Primary School in Pennyburn, was contacted by a friend who noticed the striking resemblance to her, but at first she thought it was just a coincidence. googletag.cmd.push I said Im not old enough to be in a black and white photograph, said Mrs Morroi. As time went on more and more people contacted her who suggested it was her mum, Maura Wade nee Doherty, who passed away almost seven years ago. At first Mrs Morroiwas unsureit wasdefinitely her, and she didnt want to collect the picture in case it belonged to another family. However, she was inundated with calls and messages from people who remembered her mother as a young girl and confirmed it was indeed her in the picture. Maura Dohertywas born in  the front room of her grandparentshome in  Bishops Street, which is now the Oakgrove Bar. googletag.cmd.push Her parents Maureen and George Doherty then moved to  Long Tower STreet where she grew up and attended the Wee Nuns school. My mammy worked in all the factories so everybody knew her, explained Mrs Morroi. She was a really bubbly person and would have chatted to anyone.

Its so special to get it because I only have two other pictures of my mother as a child.  Mrs Morroisaid the whole experience has been very emotional. I had been doing a redding out the house this week and I had come across a lot of my mothers things so I was just having wavesof emotion anyway and this happened. Ive just been crying my eyes out.

The Mayor is asking local children to send her either a picture, which can be accompanied by a short story, or alternatively to write a poem that focuses on the positive things that they have enjoyed despite this uncertain time. The competition will be broken up into two age groups – primary one to primary three children, aged - years old, and primary four to primary seven children, aged -. googletag.cmd.push Entries are open from todayand will close in two weeks time when the Mayor will select a winner and a runner up for each category from each age group and they will receive a goody bag of prizes. Mayor Boyle said that she wanted to give young people within the District a way of expressing their feelings creatively, while also praising them for how well they have handled the current situation. I have been so impressed with how well the children of our District have done in dealing with this strange time we are in. I know so many of them would love to be out playing in the sunshine with their friends, but they have been so good in following all of the rules and in listening to their parents and s to keep themselves, and all of us, safe. I think they should all be really proud of themselves. googletag.cmd.push Although Im sure there were a few excited faces about getting out of school, its still important to do some fun learning activities at home. This initiative is a great way to do that while also getting to draw and write down how you feel and the parts that you have enjoyed about the last few months, like spending lots of time with your family. I am so excited to read and see all the pictures, stories and poems. I already know it will be impossible to pick a winner because we have so many talented boys and girls! Entries can be submitted by emailing mayor@derrystrabane. Please include your contact details and the name and age of the child. The deadline for entries is Tuesday, May .

The Cornerstone City Church is based in the Duke Street building that was previously home to the Red Rooms nightclub. It also houses the churchs Hope Centre which offers food and clothing banks, counsellors and money management help and advice. The Hope Centre has been forced to close due to the coronavirus, but the drive-through food bank service allows them to continue their charitable work whilst observing social distancing. googletag.cmd.push Church elder, John Loughrey, explained: People are able to drive straight in off the Duke Street Roundabout and we have staff in high vis jackets to direct them. When they come in we just ask them to pop their boot open and we can place the bags of food inside. They dont even have to get out of their car. They are only there for a few minutes and it means we can still serve people the best we can. Mr Loughery said the recipients of the food parcels, which contain tinned and dried goods and fresh vegetables, have been very grateful. googletag.cmd.push There was a man who contacted us on Facebook andhe has seven kids. He said you have no idea what this means to me And there was another woman who rang for help and we left her round three bags of food. She rang us back in tears saying this is exactly what I need. We are here tohelp. If Jesus was here he wouldnt be sitting with the rich and famous hed be among the people. As the Cornerstone City Church cannot hold services at the moment it has moved them online. We usually have people from across the city coming to our church, said Mr Loughery. There are people from the Protestant community and the Catholic community. Were here to worship God. People are searching for something right now. There are people that are coming to us for food and they are wondering what are they about  They are sussing us out and thats great. “Our online videos have been shared and viewed thousands of times,” said Mr Loughrey.

Damien Groogan has been performing a marathon three-hour DJ set on Saturday nights since the lockdown regulations were introduced over a month ago. The Ballinascreen man told the County Derry Post how he decided to make the most of the collection of music he had amassed. He said: “I’ve a good bit of music gathered up so I thought I’d give it a go. I got a good slot on a Saturday night and I’ve stuck to it. googletag.cmd.push “There are a lot of lorry drivers there who would follow it for the craic and a lot of friends here and in America have shared it too. “A pile of people started sending me friend requests and I got messages telling me to keep at it, that I was raising people’s spirits. “The first week I had around  followers and by the second week it had grown to nearly .” Lockdown may have dragged for many people, but Damien has been keeping things light and doing his best to please those who are tuning in to hear his set. googletag.cmd.push “I try and keep it good and lively and not slow it down, just a mixture of everything – s and s and things for all ages,” he said. “I’m trying to play the right sort of music and keep everybody happy. I set up every Saturday night and the feedback has been great from people and other entertainers. “It’s about having a party in your own living room, lt the spirits and keep everybody up and going. I’ll keep it going as long as everyone enjoys it. “There are people up in Cavan that I deliver from in the lorry and they’re all watching it on a Saturday night with a drink in the house.”  The lorry driver says he is trying to replicate the feeling of a Saturday night out and is encouraged by the many people interacting with each other on the Facebook feed. “Getting people to talk among each other is great, it seems to be everybody’s highlight on a Saturday night.” said Damien, who is known locally as ‘Big Dee’. “People would send me messages looking for shout outs. I’d spend a good half hour beforehand reading through them and looking for birthdays and anniversaries and the like. “It’s great when you get the feedback through Facebook, especially afterwards when you see how many people have liked it, shared it and viewed it.” Damien broadcasts live on his Facebook page – damien.groogan – from around .pm every Saturday night and freely admits to enjoying himself during the set. “You’re living a Saturday night out but from the comfort of your own living room,” he said. “I do a three-hour set butflies in because everybody is enjoying it.

Damien Groogan has been performing a marathon three-hour DJ set on Saturday nights since the lockdown regulations were introduced over a month ago. The Ballinascreen man told the County Derry Post how he decided to make the most of the collection of music he had amassed. He said: “I’ve a good bit of music gathered up so I thought I’d give it a go. I got a good slot on a Saturday night and I’ve stuck to it. googletag.cmd.push “There are a lot of lorry drivers there who would follow it for the craic and a lot of friends here and in America have shared it too. “A pile of people started sending me friend requests and I got messages telling me to keep at it, that I was raising people’s spirits. “The first week I had around  followers and by the second week it had grown to nearly .” Lockdown may have dragged for many people, but Damien has been keeping things light and doing his best to please those who are tuning in to hear his set. googletag.cmd.push “I try and keep it good and lively and not slow it down, just a mixture of everything – s and s and things for all ages,” he said. “I’m trying to play the right sort of music and keep everybody happy. I set up every Saturday night and the feedback has been great from people and other entertainers. “It’s about having a party in your own living room, lt the spirits and keep everybody up and going. I’ll keep it going as long as everyone enjoys it. “There are people up in Cavan that I deliver from in the lorry and they’re all watching it on a Saturday night with a drink in the house.”  The lorry driver says he is trying to replicate the feeling of a Saturday night out and is encouraged by the many people interacting with each other on the Facebook feed. “Getting people to talk among each other is great, it seems to be everybody’s highlight on a Saturday night.” said Damien, who is known locally as ‘Big Dee’. “People would send me messages looking for shout outs. I’d spend a good half hour beforehand reading through them and looking for birthdays and anniversaries and the like. “It’s great when you get the feedback through Facebook, especially afterwards when you see how many people have liked it, shared it and viewed it.” Damien broadcasts live on his Facebook page – damien.groogan – from around .pm every Saturday night and freely admits to enjoying himself during the set. “You’re living a Saturday night out but from the comfort of your own living room,” he said. “I do a three-hour set butflies in because everybody is enjoying it. I might even take a wee beer myself during it!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McWilliams writes a weekly column in the Irish News called Dodgy Tackle. For this weeks column, which is in todays Irish News, McWilliams puts forward his best ever team. The criteria for selection is based on the premise that his World XI must be made up of up of players from dferent countries who have never played for the same club sides. McWilliamssfinal selection includes many of the worlds best known footballers - and our very own Felix Healy. googletag.cmd.push His full line-up is: Manuel Neur , Junior , Paul McGrath , Paolo Maldini , Felix Healy , Paul Gascoigne , Dragan Stojkovic , Zinedine Zidane , Kevin de Bruyne , Kenny Dalglishand Diego Maradona . Explaining his choice of Healy in the midfield, McWilliams states that it was a straight fight between the Derry man and the Colombian World Cup Carlos Valderrama. He writes: Carlos Valderrama nearly went in here, but when it comes to moustachioed midfield fulcrums, the Derry man gets in on a dodgy decision. And it is Dodgys decision. Hes playing at the base of the Diamond. Just across from the Sandwich Co. Pulled the strings for an early eighties Coleraine side that delighted this young fan, all shimmies and subtlety. The only things hairier than his upper lip were the legs bulging out of a pair of royal blue Adidas hotpants, briefly ditched for a pair of white ones as he led the Honduras midfield a merry dance for  thrilling minutes at the  World Cup.

The working paper has been drafted following a video conference between all three parties on Tuesday when the PFAI submitted a high-level paper prepared by their world governing body FIFPRO on protocols around player safety. Those recommendations have now been incorporated into the FAI’s working document - entitled ‘Return To Football – Behind Closed Doors’ - around best practice for the staging of matches when senior Irish football gets the green light to resume action from the HealthService Executive . googletag.cmd.push This document incorporates all elements around the safe staging of games behind closed doors to ensure the health and safety of players, match officials and club employees and volunteers. All clubs have been asked to assess the document andtheir views to the working group. NLEC chairperson Noel Byrne said: “This working document is the next step in assessing what is best for Irish footballthe HSE and the Government give the green light for ato action, but behind closed doors. The document is the produce of very fruitful, positive and considered talks between the NLEC, the FAI and the PFAI. googletag.cmd.push “It is vital that we examine what is needed in the event of games going on in closed stadiums, from a health and safety perspective for all stakeholders and from a financial aspect as far as the clubs are concerned. This document, produced by all stakeholders working together, presents options to the clubs and we look forward to their views when they have had a chance to study the document.” PFAI General Secretary Stephen McGuinness said: “We welcome the opportunity to be part of this very important debate in these dficult times for Irish football. Our players are keen to support the efforts of the FAI and the NLEC to examine ato football in a manner that is safe for all involved be they players, match officials or club staff. “The FIFPRO document is a high-level recommendation and the FAI have put together the fine details of what playing behind closed doors looks like for all concerned. This is very much a work in progress with all stakeholders working together towards the best solution possible for our game in the event of a closed doors recommendation from the HSE and Government.” The FAI and the NLEC remain committed to looking at alternative income streams for SSE Airtricity League clubs in the event of ato National League football behind closed doors, with live streaming opportunities under discussion. Interim Deputy CEO of the FAI, Niall Quinn said: “The working document presented to the clubs today offers a real  for debate about ato football when we get the go-ahead from Government and health officials. They will of course have the final say on when weand under what circumstances, but it is imperative on us as a working group to present the best options available to our clubs. “This document offers the clubs an insight into best practice for staging games behind closed doors. The Association also remains committed to exploring the best financial proposition available to our clubs and players at this time. Analysis of the financial impact of playing behind doors is well underway with our clubs and we are examining potential revenue streams from live streaming and other sources. This is a united effort and we look forward to further engagement with the NLEC, the PFAI, the referees and the clubs themselves.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In addition, another  food parcels were delivered by last Friday.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hubs.Down Leisure Centre has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required, with staff working in split shts, while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The new service covers the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas with deliveries focusing on food supplies with the packages including items such as tinned and dried food, cereals and some essential toiletries.Requests for help from the council and its community and voluntary partners are arriving via Access NI which is processing calls from across Northern Ireland on a freephone helpline.Council chairman Charlie Casey says he is pleased to see just how many of the districtrsquos most vulnerable residents have been able to receive food parcel deliveries recently.ldquoOur sincere thanks go to all our partners who worked with us over the Easter break to achieve this and all the volunteers who have already kindly offered their help, he continued.ldquoIt is important that we provide a leline to those following medical advice to shield to protect their health, or who are self-isolating, and have no other means of assistance.The council chairman said that during the local authorityrsquos COVID- response, it will continue to work hard to deliver essential supplies to those who need them and ensure no-one feels alone or isolated at this dficult time.A COVID- community helpline is operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support asked to make contact between am and pm, seven days a week, with the helpline managed by Advice NI who are processing calls from across Northern Ireland.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net. Contact can also be made by texting ACTION to .All calls that are relevant to the councilrsquos community co-ordination hub will be passed on to the local authority for action, including referrals from the South Eastern and Southern health trusts.The Downpatrick-based County Down Rural Community Network, the Confederation of Community Groups in Newry and Community Advice Newry Mourne and Down are acting as lead organisations for the community groups involved in this response.Members of the public are reminded that the Down Leisure Centre remains closed and that anyone who requests a food parcel will have it delivered to them directly.The County Down Rural Community Network in Downpatrick is acting as one of the lead organisations for the community groups involved in the response to the new food parcel distribution service.Any other volunteers who wish to assist in the delivery of food and supplies or ensure residents on their own at this time receive phone calls to help ease their isolation, are encouraged to register with Volunteer Now via their website.Further information about volunteering is available at www.volunteernow while organisations can identy COVID- volunteering requirements at www.volunteernow organidations.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan dressmaker makes scrubs for frontline workers in lockdown  ","story":"FROM wedding dresses to scrubs ndash thatrsquos the new order of work for Castlewellan bridal dressmaker Shirley Moorhead.Sewing a range of scrubs for nurses and nursing home workers has replaced Shirleyrsquos normal orders of stunning gowns, veils, bridesmaidsrsquo dresses and outfits for the mother of the bride and groom since the coronavirus lockdown.The  year-old was facing a full order book for spring and summer weddings until the lockdown resulted in many weddings being pushed back to the autumn and beyond.The woman behind Fairytale Designs, the mother of five was determined not to let her inactivity and seamstress skills go to waste during the lockdown over the last four weeks.She is now sewing scrubs for over  hours each day in her garden workshop, after  years of experience as a dressmaker.ldquoIrsquom sure that in any home where there is a sewing machine, local people are also doing their bit and working to sew to support the local effort with PPE, said Mrs Moorhead.ldquoAt the moment, while Irsquom being very productive, I canrsquot earn a living with what I do, like so many others. Therersquos plenty like me and we are all in the same boat.ldquoIt started when I received requests from nurses who I made their wedding or bridesmaid dresses in the past for. I ended up making scrubs for some entire hospital wards, male and female and in a iety of sizes.ldquoThat widened out to sewing for staff at local nursing homes. I just want to do something to help, particularly for nursing homes as my daughter, Abigail, works in one in Castlewellan.There is plenty of work to be done to complete her bridal orders, but Mrs Moorhead feels that her priority is for scrubs.ldquoMy weddings have been pushed back until October or November or even next year. There are things that would hamper me. I canrsquot see brides to fit them and I wouldnrsquot want to go too far ahead with orders in case some people gain weight or lose weight, she said.ldquoAlso,the wedding changes seasons, that can change the outfit ordered in style and colour. For instance, a mother of the bride might want a jacket as well or might want to lose or shorten sleeves so I feel I canrsquot go to far ahead with my orders. Brides have needed me to reassure them that everything will be alright for their big day, whenever it happens, and I can absolutely promise that.ldquoAbigail is getting married in November and her sister, Johanna, is getting married next May, so they will be the most special wedding dresses I will make in my letime. I feel that I have to keep going with the scrubs as itrsquos so important. However, I will make sure that I will provide all outfits that have been ordered from me. It has become a family affair as Mrs Moorheadrsquos husband, Joe, who also is unable to work as an engineer in the lockdown, helps with the pressing of the garments while Johanna helps with the sewing.Mrs Moorhead has been creating the scrubs from donated material, much of it brand new, and is very grateful for the donations..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar man takes Chance with move to Hong Kong 26 years later opens superstore  ","story":"AT the age of  and without a word of Cantonese, Richard Bowsie left his family and friends behind in his home village of Crossgar for a le of adventure in Hong Kong.Twenty-six years later and now a married father of two, Richard has found love, happiness as well as a successful career as the owner of two second-hand furniture stores in the huge cosmopolitan city with over seven million inhabitants.He and his locally-born we, Mavis, run nd Chance Furniture that provides shoppers in the city and online across the world a virtual Aladdinrsquos Cave with thousands of unique and affordable items - ranging from lacquered tables to pool tables, Chinese vases to Balinese drums.While other young ambitious men were told to lsquogo westrsquo, Richard went east, finding Hong Kong to be every bit as much the land of opportunity as the United States.The father of eight year-old daughter Kailey and son George, whorsquos coming five, literally changed his le in three days when he made the decision to fly to Hong Kong.From working as a leguard at the Tropicana centre in Newcastle and at the former Down Leisure Centre, the former student of the High School, Ballynahinch, had been close to completing his BTec qualication in Leisure Management at the former Newcastle College of Further Education.He ped out of his course a few months shy of graduation due to bullying. While his parents, Margaret and Ken, a well-known architect, were shocked at their middle sonrsquos decision, they were not surprised.He recalled: ldquoI had a friend who had travelled to Hong Kong three months previously. During a phone call he told me that the new international airport was under construction and work was easy to find. Three days later I arrived.ldquoI decided to go by myself as I had been trying to find an exciting job at home for a while but kept being told I was too young for the roles or lacked experience. My parents knew I was ambitious and how frustrated I was becoming with my career ambitions being knocked back all the time.Richard admitted he hadnrsquot a clue what to do once he arrived and took a bar managerrsquos job as an interim position as many of the airport workers drank there.His first job at the airport turned out to be with the Northern Ireland company, Lagan Construction Group, before going to another Belfast-based company, Rotary International, with which he worked for two years.ldquoI felt excited and nervous all at the same time when I first moved to Hong Kong, said Richard.ldquoThe first thing that struck me was the heat, after leaving cold and damp of home. Arriving in  degrees and high humidity was certainly a shock to the system, despite having been on family holidays to France most years with my family and once to America with a cross community group. The heat in Asia was a massive shock.Having grown up in a rented manse on the Rademon estate, Richard swapped a quiet rural existence for the hustle and bustle of the global port and major commerce centre. It was still under British rule and would remain so for another three years before it was handed back to China.Richard said: ldquoLanguage was the biggest shock but I made it my mission to learn the language and enrolled in YMCA lessons but also managed to pick it up from also working alongside locals.It wasnrsquot long before Richard felt confident enough to start out his own business, an electrical supply company which employed  staff.He said: ldquoI knew after the first few months that Hong Kong was going to work for me,you worked hard, nothing could hold you back, age was not an issue here. Opening a business here was very straight forward, just need a bank account and register an address.He met his we Mavis during his first month in the city and the two have been together ever since.They opened their first store in  in the after seeing a large amount of good furniture being thrown away each week and were determined to do something that would reduce the waste and help the environment. Within months, they had outgrown this store and relocated to their current , sq ft premises in Tuen Mun.The couple has recently opened a second, , sq ft premises in Chai Wan which is closer to the busy capital.Fluent in Cantonese for many years, Richard has seen Hong Kong go through many challenges, not in the least with the recent coronavirus pandemic.ldquoHong Kong has handled the virus very well, having been through SARS and bird flu before, said Richard. ldquoAs soon as we heard there was an issue over the border in China, Hong Kong went straight into prevention measures before even being advised to. Now everyone wears masks and observes hygiene measures.The preventative measures must have been successful as the city recorded zero deaths on Monday for the first time since the outbreak before Christmas.While the move to Hong Kong was the right one for Richard, he still misses home and his brothers and sisters, Simon, Gillian, Laura and William.He said: ldquoI miss the food, the greenery and, of course, my family who are all still in Northern Ireland. I miss being close to home as I have lost family members and grandparents.ldquoBut we come home as often as we can. Mavis and the kids love Crossgar, especially AJs Diner. They love the Rademon estate where we lived beside, walks down the Church Road to Kilmore and the open green fields. We have very few here in Hong Kong and any we do have are full of mosquitos.Home is always on Richardrsquos mind, as is his business.He adds: ldquoNext for our business is hopefully more expansion as I would like to start exporting furniture to other countries such as Northern Ireland.

OrsquoHare has the advantage as he is stable amateur to Navan trainer Noel Meade.Noel McParlan also got on the scoreboard and he was the top local point-to-point rider.Last week proved to be a sad one for local racing on Easter Sunday as Dr Fitz Gillespie, MBE, passed away suddenly at the age of . He was the GP in Tynan, Co Armagh, for  years.Dr Gillespie was one of the nicest men that I have ever met and was a long serving member of the Turf Club and IHRB. Although I donrsquot remember him riding, I know he did so for many years, and was also a trainer and owned horses right up to .His son, Pat, also rode as an amateur and professional, spending a good bit of his riding days with Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee. I can recall him winning on Raise An Argument at Downpatrick. Like his father, he also trained and one of his locally based owners was Joe McGrath, from Annacloy.Dr Gillespie was a regular steward at local meetings and also at many Southern racecourses. He was also a good supporter of the former Downpatrick Racecourse Supporters Club. He acted as a steward at the Armagh PTSP on April .He is predeceased by his first we, Dr Barbara, and also Lady Jane Alexander. He is survived by sons Pat and Rollo, daughter Gael, son-in-law, daughters-in-law and grandchildren.A memorial service will be held for Dr Gillespie at a later date as the funeral was private due to Covid-.

Mr James said bluntly yesterday:ldquoThere are people who had an opportunity to say things at an early stage but did not. Now they have really pulled the carpet out from under our feet at an advanced stage. Irsquom bitterly disappointed at this kind of timing.The problem arose when the Housing Executive was in the final stages of preparing a scheme, which has been on the drawing board for several years, when it was told of the Government objections to a number of potential sites, including the Burren River catchment area and another, the most important, at the Dundrum Road end of the town.The Executive had finally got an agreement to purchase from the landowner of the Dundrum Road site and had made a final routine check with the Government departments before clinching a deal. It was only then that the objections were revealed by Stormont, which had been kept informed of all moves over the years.DOWNPATRICK ndash A Downpatrick woman has been named as one of the top ten lsquoWomen of the Yearrsquo by the readers of a daily newspaper.Mrs Terry Dunbar was selected by readers of the Belfastand is to be honoured at the Woman of the Year Luncheon in the City Hall, Belfast, next month.Mrs Dunbar works by day in the occupational therapy department of the Downshire Hospital, Downpatrick, and most of her spare time is spent in voluntary work for the mentally ill and mentally handicapped.She is secretary of the Newcastle Society for Mentally Handicapped Children and is leader of the Down Peter Pan Club for children under .One of the most successful activities of the club is riding. ldquoI take members to the Newcastle Riding Centre every other Saturday and the people there are very good.Mrs Dunbar also runs the Gateway Club at the Downshire Hospital where the members ages range from early s to elderly.KINAHALLA ndash The decision to scrap the Kinahalla Dam project in the Mournes has been welcomed this week as lsquoa decision of sanityrsquo.The comment was made by Dr Arthur Mitchell, chairman of Komrade , the main opposition group to the scheme.Dr Mitchell said: ldquoBasically Komrade is delighted with the decision of the Water Appeals Commission. They have agreed with us that the water which they required was not there and this scheme would have caused serious ecological damage.Confirmation that the objectors had won the fight over the Kinahalla scheme came on Friday, when the Environment Minister, Mr Philip Goodhart, said his department had accepted the findings of the Commission which came out against the pound. million project.News that the Commission had recommended the scheme should be ped was leaked last month.

It is also my understanding that Newry, Mourne and Down Council and Northern Irelandrsquos other  councils are working closely alongside the government department at this time.Cllr Walker said he would like to see the recycling centres open again, suggesting that strict controls could be introduced to only allow two vehicles access them at any one time.ldquoI would also appeal to people at this time to keep their waste until the recycling centres are open again. I appreciate that many people who are not at work at the moment are making the most of the time they have to clean out their homes, sheds and garages and I commend them for being active.ldquoHowever, it simply isnrsquot on to load up you car with waste, drive to a secluded area and dump it. I just donrsquot understand the mentality of people who engage in this kind of behaviour.Cllr Walker also said the cost of clearing up illegal waste is borne by the districtrsquos ratepayers.ldquoWe have the ironic situation that those who dump their waste illegally end up paying for its removal viatheir rates. This beggars belief, he declared. ldquoThe stupidity of those who dump waste in secluded areas is beyond me.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe time has come for common sense and people really need to catch a grip of themselves. One of the most worrying aspectsof illegal dumping is that waste which ends up in fields is sometimes eatenby livestock which often results in deadly consequences. To those who dump their waste illegal my appeal is stop now.The local council has confirmed that it is receiving increasing reports about fly-tipping across the district since the start of the COVID- crisis. But the organisation insists that it is currently able to manage the issue within existing resources.A council spokesman said that the organisation continues to work closely with the Environment Agency which also performs a key role in addressing incidents of larger illicit dumping.On the issue of reopening the districtrsquos household recycling centres, the spokesman explained that the decision is continually being reviewed in line with government social distancing measures.He continued: ldquoFly-tipping is illegal and the council will strictly enforce this where evidence can be gathered. Responding to fly-tipping incidents also erts important council resources away from providing other essential services.The spokesman confirmed that the council is unable to remove illicitly-dumped waste from privately-owned land, explaining that where this occurs, both it and the Environment Agency has the legal powers to request its removal.He said the council will enforce this where required.The spokesman added: ldquoThe council would urge the public to avoid producing any unnecessary waste, including undertaking DIY and house and garden clearances at this time due to the considerable pressure being placed on public services.ldquoAny additional waste that is produced should be stored for future disposal at the household recycling centres once they re-open.

In a glittering playing career, the Ballykinlar man went on to win two more All-Ireland medals and established himself as one of the legends of the Gaelic football. Here, he selects his greatest Down team of all timeHIS name alone is enough to rekindle treasured memories of a time when Down football reigned supreme.Paddy lsquoMorsquo Doherty had the deadliest left foot in Ireland and he used it to maximum effect as Down swept all before them.Incredibly, itrsquos  years ago that Down took the sporting world by storm when they defeated Kerry to win the All-Ireland senior football title for the first time. It was also the first time that a team north of the border had won the Sam Maguire Cup.To reinforce their emergence as a new power in Gaelic football, Down retained their title the following year with Paddy as captain of the side which defeated Offaly and he was also a member of the Down team which won a third All-Ireland for the county in , Kerry again falling victim to the Red and Black machine in the final.As well as his three All-Ireland medals, Paddy won seven Ulster Championship, seven Railway Cup and three National League medals. He was the leading scorer in Ulster for eight seasons and in Ireland for three years.Now in his s, hersquos followed Downrsquos fluctuating fortunes ever since, relishing in theof the glory days in the early s, sharing in the disappointment of the barren times and casting a critical eye from the sidelines, though always with the optimistic outlook of the true fan.So what does he believe is the greatest Down team of all time Not surprisingly, given their accomplishments, hersquos largely selected his choice from his team-mates from the Sixties mdash though with typical modesty, he has not picked himself for the starting .ldquoYou have to remember that the Down team of s was the first to bring the Sam Maguire over the border, he says.ldquoThat was a really big achievement and we had beaten Kerry in the final. We had shown we were the best team in Ireland and we proved that again the following year in the final against Offaly after beating Kerry in the semi-final. We also beat Kerry in the  final, which meant that we had beaten them three times.ldquoKerry have always been the benchmark. If we had not beaten them, they would have won another three All-Irelands.Asked how his Down team would fare against present day sides ldquoItrsquos a dferent game now, what with the blanket defence and other things, but the Down teams of the s would have won in any era. Well, thatrsquos what I think, though Irsquom sure there are many people who would disagree. Eddie McKay Eddie won two All-Ireland medals with me in  and . He was a very good goalkeeper believe me, always safe, dependable and brave. He was an excellent shot stopper and made many excellent saves. I also played against him many times when Ballykinlar took on Dundrum. These were local parish derbies and everyone was trying to kill each other, but somehow Dundrum never managed to beat us. George Lavery George also won two All-Irelands in  and . He was the quiet man on the team, but there were few better man markers in the game and he would have been a star in any era. He had played a match of two for Antrim, but Maurice Hayes, who was secretary of the Down county board, persuaded him to sign for Down. He played as sweeper and was a good, tight marker. Leo Murphy Leo was a terric full back, tough and reliable. Not too many players could get past him and he could kick the ball a long distance. He also won two All-Irelands in  and . Pat Rice There was no one better than Pat Rice at catching a ball. His high fielding was magnicent and he was quick at clearing the ball. He gave away few chances and often kicked the ball out for Eddie McKay. He missed little and he wasnrsquot a dirty player at all. Dan McCartan One of only three Down players to win three All-Ireland senior medals along with Sean OrsquoNeill, Joe Lennon and myself, Dan is one of the all-time greats of Down football. He had outstanding ability, tackled hard and always looked for the quick clearance up to the front men. He could play anywhere as he showed when he moved to full back in the  final. Joe Lennon He was our captain in , though he did not play in the second after getting injured. He was a great captain and a terric leader. Joe placed a great emphasis on fitness and pioneered new coaching practices. He thought greatly about the game and was possibly ahead of his time. He was a very talented player. Tom OrsquoHare Tom played in the  team, but was good enough to get his place on any team. He was probably one of our best players that year. He was always steady and was great at delivering a ground ball. Jarlath Carey Jarlath won two All-Irelands in  and . He was a tireless worker, who was at home either in midfield or in attack. He was always forcing his way into the forward line and would wag his finger at me to go back into midfield to cover for him. I didnrsquot mind one bit, because he was good enough and I was fit enough to do what he asked. Colm McAlarney They called Colm lsquoThe Mighty Arklersquo after the famous racehorse because of his long strides up the field. Colm and Tom OrsquoHare were our two outstanding players in  and Colm was definitely one of the best midfielders in Ireland at that time, or any other time. Tony Hadden Tony won two All-Irelands in  and . He could fist the ball further than many players could kick it and he could also move into midfieldthings were going bad. He was tall and well built and could score a point as well as anyone. James McCartan A very strong player. Down would not have won anything without him because he took a lot of the abuse which would otherwise have been directed at me or Sean OrsquoNeill. He played a critical role in the  final against Offaly. We were two goals down in the first half and getting beaten. I crossed the ball to James who turned in mid air and put into the back of the net. Two more goals from Sean OrsquoNeill and Breen Morgan had us a goal up at half time, but it was his goal that turned things around. Sean OrsquoNeill You would have to say that Sean was the greatest Down footballer of them all. He was named in the GAA Team of the Century which says it all. We played well together, wherever I kicked the ball, Sean was there to get it. He had a wonderful sidestep and took a lot of abuse, but he never retaliated. He went on to become a successful manager and won the Sigerson Cup with Queenrsquos University. Mickey Linden Mickey was a flying machine and one of Downrsquos best ever forwards. He could blow defences away with his pace and score with either foot. He was also very versatile. You could play him anywhere and he would still be a threat. Perhaps his only failing was that he was too nice a player. He rarely made a foul. Won two All-Irelands in  and . Patsy OrsquoHagan Full forward and winner of two All-Irelands in  and . He could have played full forward, full back, or just about anywhere . He was that good. One of his best performances was Wembley Stadium during one of the Wembley Cup tournaments when he scored four goals against Galway. Breen Morgan They made them tough in Annaclone and for his size Breen was one of the hardest men on the field. He had broken his jaw before the  All-Ireland final, but went to the field without the protector which was made specially for him. He just threw it on to a chair. He was marked by Offalyrsquos Paddy McCormick, who was made of iron, but Breen was afraid of no one.Paddyrsquos substitutesDanny Kelly , Greg Blaney , Barry Breen , James Milligan , Ross Carr , Paddy OrsquoRourke , DJ Kane , Dan Gordon , Benny Coulter , Paddy Doherty ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Queen.jpg","title":"Queen Karen Europe’s best  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother is a European powerlting champion at the age of .Karen Burns won the European title in France in March and set a new world record in the process.Powerlting involves three disciplines mdash squat, bench press and deadlt mdash and Karen capped a brilliant performance with a world record breaking lt of  kilos in the deadlt.Itrsquos a fantastic achievement for Karen, who only took up powerlting four years ago.The legal secretary, who has two daughters and four grandchildren, started gym classes at the age of , but within a few months made the switch to powerlting.Coached by Aaron Kelly, from Affinity Fit at the CG Fitness gym in Annacloy, she trained four times a week and was soon competing and winning medals at a national, international and world levels.She was the British champion two years running in  and .

I noticed within the first several days that I was able to breath more easily in the mornings and I was coughing much less. I am not a smoker.ldquoThe incessant pace of traffic in the street has slowed to a hush and my window sills inside my house are much cleaner. Before the lockdown, I could have drawn a line across the sills with my finger and it would have left a white mark in the soot which would gather.ldquoHaving the time that lockdown has inadvertently provided, I decided I would respond to a call-out to have-a-go playwrights to write something about their experience of self isolation.Gavin describes the scene as he pulled out the plug to let the water away. ldquoIt suddenly came to me as I watched the water drain away that it was an analogy for humanity, that we too are in great danger of being sucked down the plug hole to oblivion.So I got ready and immediately wrote the whole play sitting on the edge of my bed. It took me  minutes and I spent the next three weeks reworking it until I was happy.Central to the play is Jake, a man in his late s, who is in self-isolation and being cared for by his put-upon daughter, Martha.Gavin explains: ldquoWhile shersquos out getting groceries, he ponders upon the plight of the human race as it is metaphorically sucked down the plughole to oblivion.ldquoThroughout the play, Jake is visited by several characters mdash a City shark who represents the financial markets, a Navy er who see that humanity is in terrible trouble, the Prime Minister and God, who commands a less-than-enthusiastic Jake to build an ark and save mankind.Gavin says Jake becomes overwhelmed thinking that itrsquos too big of a job to build an ark. Hersquos not surehe has got the energy.ldquoThe play also includes two young mothers debating a brutal and radical way to build a new plug from the flesh and bone of every misfit in society, two floating dim-witted teenagers and a dancing bath plug bearing a last minute solution to the problem, said Gavin.ldquoAt the end of the play, Jakersquos lottery numbers come up and his winning ticket appears in the beak of a dove mdash the Christian symbol for peace.Down the Plughole, which reads as a tragicomedy, shines a spotlight on modern society and its impending doomlove and kindness fail to prevail.Gavin says he has taken inspiration from two comic plays, One Man, Two Guvnors by Richard Bean and Government Inspector by Nikolai Gogol, and the classic novel by William Golding, Lord of the Flies.Gavin added: ldquoJake realises that in the end money is worthless and that love and good health, which are in short supply in the play, are all that is important.Amelia Madan, head of amateur plays at Josef Weinberger Plays, said: ldquoDown the Plughole is a hilarious, ludicrous and bold play for these crazy unchartered times.ldquoWe are delighted Gavin chose to put some of the uncertainty about out fate as a species we all feel, into words, with a generous dash of delicious absurdism and a fabulous ending..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd April 2020 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa Wells LOL provide gift packs to health workers  ","story":"LOCAL Orangemen have been looking out for frontline workers during the current public health emergency.Members of Spa Wells Orange Lodge distributed free gt packs which included Easter eggs and cosmetics for health workers based at two local nursing homes.Approximately  staff who care for elderly residents at Fishbourne House and Spa Nursing Home were thrilled to receive their pamper packs and thanked the lodge for thinking of them in the current situation.Lodge member John Aiken said they were delighted with the success of their community project and added they are currently working on another similar community-based initiative..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10447479.jpg","title":"nathan carter concert helps heroes fund top  ","story":"PLEASENOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

This would be known as Serious Condition Criteria.While widely welcomed, what was not made clear was Departmental staff have discretion around who meets criteria and can overrule a claimantrsquos medical evidence.A number of enquiries were submitted to the Department under a Freedom of Information request.The responses are concerning.The Department stated legislation does not refer to serious conditions but rather whether there is a relevant change of circumstances. The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who are unlikely to ever move into work: ldquoTook effect from  September , but did not result in legislative change.The Department was asked about the right of appealing a decision rejecting a claimant for Serious Conditions Criteria, who responded: ldquoThere is no automatic right of appeal against a determination which is embodied in or necessary to a decision. , a claimant has a right of appeal against an outcome decision rather than a determination, which is merely a component of the outcome decision.This was complicated for non-legally trained or represented claimants, so questions were put around full compliance with the Disability Discrimination and Human Rights.The Department responded stating it: ldquoDoes not hold any information relating to this hellip.may have been undertaken by DWP.A copy of the risk-assessment template used by the Department in instances of considering Serious Condition Criteria, was requested, but: ldquoNo template existsInstead, the response referred to assessment procedures where Departmental Healthcare Professionals advise on the re-referral period, and consider whether a claimantrsquos condition meets: ldquoThe new severe conditions criteria andno further assessments are required.However, the claimantrsquos own medical professionalrsquos opinion around Serious Condition Criteria could be over-ruled, with this decided by: ldquoAn Administrative Officer appointed by the Department.In respect of providing the legislation or guidance which permits the Department to overrule clinical opinion provided by a claimant seeking consideration under the Serious Condition Criteria, the response referred to ESA Regulations , which: ldquoProvides for the redetermination of whether someone has limited capability for work. The time period in relation to this is not set down in the legislation but is largely at the Department Decision Makers discretion ndash usually based on available medical evidence including medical reports from ATOS hellip The decision not to reassess those with severe, lelong disabilities or health conditions who would be unlikely to ever move into work, took effect from  September  but did not result in legislative change.As the Freedom of Information request was answerd prior to the restoration of devolution, the Department was asked with a Minister now in post, to comment on current processes around Serious Condition Criteria decision-making and in particular, how it can by discretion supersede a medical diagnosis by a claimantrsquos clinician. It was also askedprocedures are under review andthere is intention to bring forward legislation to allow for scrutiny or challenge.A spokesperson said: ldquo Anyone claiming ESA will be automatically assessed for the Severe Conditions criteria at their Work Capability Assessment by a Healthcare Professional. If the personrsquos condition or its al effects meet the criteria, the Department will be advised that no further assessments are required.In response to the overruling of clinical decisions, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe Work Capability Assessment looks at the al effects of a personrsquos condition, rather than the diagnosis itself. It is not a supersession of the opinion of their clinician.This dfered to the response provided prior to the Minister taking office, which appeared to show the Department was permitted to over-rule the evidence of claimantrsquos clinician.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reality is we will look at the medical evidence. The Northern Ireland Executive will have its own flexibility and we may see across the country some iations we saw some iations going into lockdown as well. Itrsquoll be a decision that all four nations take together based on the evidence, he said.Mr. Lewis said he was aware of the complexities of Northern Irelandrsquos Border with the Republic of Ireland amid the pandemic, explaining that he has been meeting with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle OrsquoNeill and Taacutenaiste Simon Coveney.ldquoEven where there are dferences in the approach between the Republic and the North,there are,we know that we can make sure we are clear with residents why those dferences are there.ldquoThe challenge of having iations within Northern Ireland is how we manage that.An investigation in The Sunday Times at the weekend featured a Whitehall source claiming the government ldquomissed the boat on testing and PPEand ldquojust watched as the death toll mounted in Wuhan, China.The report also claimed that Prime Minister Boris Johnson missed five crucial COBRA meetings in the Cabinet Office in London.When asked to respond to these serious allegations, Mr. Lewis said: ldquoI didnrsquot recognise some of what I saw in the Times.ldquoI was in the Cobra meetings in January and February COBRA meetings are chaired by the Secretary of State in the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Itrsquos a place, not a thing.ldquoWe were making decisions the scientists and medical experts were making decisions at that time and planning was going on. This is the point to judge it now when we have two months more evidence is dangerous and a misleading thing to do.Turning to PPE which has been an issue in Fermanagh, Mr. Lewis used his own constituency of Great Yarmouth as an example of where there has been ldquono problems with accessing equipment.He added: ldquoWersquove had gowns sent over to the UK, OrsquoNeills [sportswear] converted to gowns, there is gin distillery in your part of the world producing sanitisers.ldquoWersquore shting five and a half million pieces of PPE across to Northern Ireland. Wersquove been able to supply that itrsquos in good order. I am talking to the first minster every day that.Mr. Lewis said the priority of the United Kingdom government is to make sure ldquowe donrsquot hit the second peak of the virus.ldquoOne of the most damaging things economically would be, as well as health wise, to start coming out of lockdown ndash restaurants, pubs, whatever start opening again ndash and suddenly you have to close down again and thatrsquos not viable.ldquoI think itrsquos right to be cautious about this wersquoll make that decision in a few weeks.ldquoThe science is shting on this the experience is changing. I am cautious about predicting what will be in a few weeksrsquo time.He believes the government could ldquoflatten the curve of Covid-people continue to stay at home, adding: ldquoWe want to see past the peak, you donrsquot want to see a downward trend and ease up as all you do is let it shoot back up again.ldquoIf you think back to the beginning there were some quite scary numbers being put about by some experts about what the deaths might be. Now any death is too many and we have sadly lost people, friends and family who have gone through tragic experiences recently, and the figures are nowhere near those numbers we saw at the beginning.ldquoThatrsquos because the public across Northern Ireland and the UK have done a good job generally of following the guidelines which means we can flatten that curve, he said.Mr. Lewis explained that he had personal experience of people close to him who had been diagnosed with Covid-, including his parliamentary private secretary.ldquoSomeone I know lost a member of their family this week, I have a few people in family who had the disease.

There is a transition period where you are not really the Archbishop of Armagh but you want to be as helpful as you can and you are also I suppose trying to work out what and how you are going to approach the task.The Archbishop-Elect explained the three facets to the roleHe said there was the appointment of Bishop of the Diocese of Armagh, which has a larger population with a great number of large towns in it than Clogher Diocese.In addition, there is the role of Primacy of All Ireland, considered lsquoFirst among equalsrsquo acknowledging there is another Primate in the southern province but to some degree to be an ambassador for the Church of Ireland.He added: ldquoThe third element is your place within the wider Anglican Communion which I have relatively little experience of. You become a member of the Primatersquos Meeting which is one of the instruments of communion within Anglicanism. There are a number of ways we hold ourselves together, the Lambeth Conference, the office of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Anglican Consultative Council and more recently, the Primatersquos Meeting.So what type of church do you see under your leadership ldquoItrsquos dficult to speak for the church as the Church of Ireland General Synod is the body which has that authority. There is a saying that the Church of Ireland is synodically governed and episcopally led. What the Archbishop of Armagh can do is to speak to the Church and suggest can concern itself with. It sets a bit of a tone as well. Itrsquos about its spiritual le and its own governance and the need to acknowledge that like probably all institutions and all bodies some bits of it do well and some do not do well some bits are growing and some bits are shrinking some bitsvery well and some bitsnot so well and to maybe try to discover that the bits that do not do well could do a bit better, in terms of spiritual le and acknowledging there is a huge ersity within Anglicanism and to remember that thatrsquos all part of the Anglican heritage.ldquoThere are obviously particularly challenges at the moment, what the church says to society and what it does for the society in which it is placed. You cannot pretend it doesnrsquot live in a political context. Politics is not something that just happens in Parliament. Democracies are places where political discussion or dialogue are about what we can do together or decisions which are deeply embedded. There are institutions which are recognisable bodies in civil society such as the business community, trade unions, voluntary sector and churches are one of those. I think they have their particular things to say and its perfectly legitimate for them to say it.ldquoThe big imponderable at the moment is coronavirus and we have no idea how deeply that will affect the patterns of society. We could come out the other side of that challenge a changed society, with maybe small changes and maybe some very profound changes. Of course the other big external issue is Brexit which involves the relationships between the dferent regions within Ireland and the United Kingdom.ldquoI could be in both parts of that jurisdiction in one day praying for good governance for both of them and for their leaders, he said.In terms of reaching out to people in the Church of Ireland, the Archbishop-Elect recalled how a Northern Ireland Le and Times survey revealed around  per cent of people in Northern Ireland attend church at some point. He said the heyday for attending church was in the period from the late th Century to the period to the middle of the s. But he thinks current attendance is ldquoback to the old norm with fewer people committed to regular churchgoing.He rightly points out that churches are among the very few inter-generational bodies with people of dferent ages attending.The Archdeacon-Elect says people in very small rural parishes are committed to their churches in the sense that they are contributing to their community who feel it is being enriched with their presence. He said the church finds its place in the community.ldquoThe second challenge is what we are for ourselves as a group, as a faith community, how we build up the church, which canrsquot live in isolation but we have our particular family traditions - how we contribute to the ersity of Ireland, how we build up the church to be confident communities of faith and not hesitant or fearful or invisible communities of faith.He said for the Church of Ireland, there was tremendous heritage from Anglicanism.ldquoThe Church of Ireland has a particular way of doing things, liturgically. Liturgy is both the expression and source of our belief. Our vocation may be to hold together what on the face of it appear to be contradictory things is maybe one of our roles in religious and spiritual le. I have no ideait is the best way to be a Christian but it is our way and it seems to contribute something to the catholic church, the wider church.ldquoHarry McAdoo, a well-known Archbishop of Dublin and a great scholar, once said, lsquoIf I hadnrsquot been born an Anglican, I would have had to become one.rsquoThe Archbishop-Elect leaves Clogher Diocese after forging and maintaining good relations with other denominations.He said: ldquoI think the vast majority of committed Christian people see more in common with other Christian traditions than separating us. There is a very long history of ecumenism in the diocese of Armagh as well. There is a long association and friendship with Archbishop Eamon Martin and I hope we can continue to build relationships and friendships.The Archbishop-Elect trained for Church of Ireland ministry after a career in industry in which he held a senior role in Shorts and was for a time, Assistant Director of the CBI in Northern Ireland.ldquoThat probably give me some skills in organisation and about leadership. Irsquove been very lucky here. Irsquom not very fond of the word lsquoleaderrsquo in the ecclesiastical world but one of the things a leader does is to build a team around him. It is almost a contradiction in terms to be involved in a leadership role in Christianity, to do it on your own.ldquoThere are certain things as a bishop that end with you. There are plenty of lonely moments in that sense where you have to make decisions. But by and large business acclimatised me to working with all sorts of dferent people from all sorts of dferent backgrounds in dferent ways and to experience what every parishioner experiences, normal working le with those pressures.As Bishop of Clogher the new Archbishop-Elect held a number of positions nationally and internationally representing the Church.He was the Church of Ireland contact person to the Churches of the Porvoo Communion which represents the Scandanavian and Baltic Lutherans as well as the Spanish and Portuguese Anglicans and other Anglican churches and provinces from these islands making contact at senior level travelling with them.He has also held senior roles on the Irish Council of Churches, the national ecumenical instrument and also the Irish Inter-Church meeting, the latter which includes the Roman Catholic church.He said those bodies were important especially as ecumenism was becoming bland and it was important to keep going and keep talking.These inter-church bodies contribute to providing resources for churches around Brexit, homelessness, welfare reform and subjects churches would be expected to have a voice in.ldquoI enjoyed that hugely, I am coming to the end of that, six years in total two years as vice-President, two years as President and two years as outgoing Vice President. I will be involved again as a member of the Church Leadersrsquo Meeting.The Archbishop-Elect says of his time in Clogher Diocese ldquoItrsquos always been an aim of mine wherever I have worked to try to create a family atmosphere where there are degrees of mutual respect and degrees of mutual accountability. I remember saying that the diocese of Clogher is big enough to do thingswe all pull together in the same direction and small enough for everybody to be necessary for that to happen and to be accountable for what the contribution is. If you treat people with respect, then relationships are easier.ldquoBy and large I felt people were for me rather than against me. It helpsyou are reasonably interested in people and their families and what they do and acknowledge that as an important factor in their faith. Whoever the next Bishop of Clogher is theyshould allow him or her to be his or her own bishop of Clogher and not that they should be like me, Brian Hannon or Michael Jackson or like St. Macartan.The Archbishop-Elect says he enjoys reading history and poetry and in terms of music, takes particular pleasure in the tradition of Anglican anthems . He does admit to particularly enjoying the Psalms which are poetry.The Archbishop-Elect acknowledges that his mother who had a profound influence on his le, reciting the Daily Office at home and was happily committed to God and His Church and would have sung the Te Deum while washing the dishes. One of her favourite biblical phrases was from the Gospel of St. John, Chapter  ldquoI come that you would have le and that you might have it more abundantly.Relaxation for the Archdeacon-Elect is visiting one of his favourite places, the Ulster Museum to see the collection of Irish Art and reading.ldquoThe thing I am looking to reading most is I took possession of the third volume of Hilary Mantelrsquos Wolf Hall trilogy about Thomas Cromwell, lsquoThe Mirror and Light,rsquo an historical novel, he adds.The Archbishop-Electrsquos we Mary teaches in Enniskillen Royal Grammar School and his daughter, Dorothy, is at the University of Oxford.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.
