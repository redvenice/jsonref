Photograph: Aidan CrawleyBloombergJude – as anyone who was paying attention in their religion classes should know – is the patron saint of lost causes, and a reader who shares a name with the saint only got in touch with us after fearing their cause was lost. “I am writing regarding an awful experience I’ve had with Three recently,” the mail from Jude starts. “It feels like there must be some element of this that I can do something about, but I’m not sure what.”Jude says the “crux of the matter is their refusal to cancel my contract with them after them delaying technical help beyond the point of my trial period ending, but they kept me stringing along. I have probably been naive in not just cancelling anyway, but if there is anything you can do to help, I would be very grateful.”And so to the story. “I have been a Three broadband customer for years, and have been out of contract with them for at least a year, maybe two. I have continued to pay €30 per month (out of contract) for an unlimited 4G service until I recently upgraded. Wanting 5G to be able to cover the gaps sometimes there in 4G coverage, I upgraded by online chat on Sunday October 17th, receiving the modem on the following Tuesday. “Initially my coverage was good, if not as fast as I hoped, but fast enough to make an upgrade just about worthwhile.”Before she upgraded she had about 70-90 megabits per second (Mbps) on her 4G plan this went up to about 200Mbps at first on 5G, though it fluctuated a little.“After two days of this, I lost all coverage on the Thursday morning, and when it came back it was even faster – peaking at about 480Mbps. All this sounds great and I would have been happy with that. However, this is where the trouble starts.“After a few hours of this speed, my broadband signal dropped again, and went to about 18-22Mbps consistently. This was not only much slower than my previous connection, but also slower than the ‘guaranteed’ 25Mbps for 5G that they advertise. I contacted their technical support, and they recommended turning it off and on again. I had already done this, to no effect, but did it again to humour them. They then ‘reset the network’ – no difference. They then recommended something that seemed to work to some degree: take the Sim out, and put it back in, then restart to allow the Sim to register again etc. This worked to the point of getting about 100-150Mbps, again hardly earthshaking but decent.”But the higher speed only ever lasted an hour or two, then dropped and went back to 18-22MBps.“I contacted customer service again and again. They constantly asked me to do the same basic things, never reading case notes, and telling me to try things related to wifi (already ruled out by using cable connection) etc. Literally just basic things that were a complete waste of time, and I was getting quite frustrated by now. By about the fourth time being in touch about it, around the Saturday 23rd, they finally realised it was something else and agreed to escalate the case. They said I could expect a call from the technical team about it.”The call didn’t come by the following Tuesday, so Jude got back in touch. “I explained the issue and that I was waiting on a call, but they just went through all the basics again. After another couple of contacts made with them, someone finally told me that there hadn’t been a ticket raised. I got them to raise the ticket again, and expressed clearly my concern that my trial period would be finished before I was allowed to speak to someone with the needed technical expertise. They promised a callback by Friday, allowing me a little time to still test the service in my remaining few days of the trial period.”Friday came but the call did not. “More contact made with the support team. They told me to contact the technical team direct. Everyone else told me I had to wait for a call from them. They gave me a number – no answer. They gave me another one, and I spoke to someone who had no more technical knowledge than I did. But at least she listened and recognised more expertise was needed. Incidentally, she told me that the previous case had been closed, without my knowledge or any call to me. I again expressed that I really needed to at least have the trial period extended. She said that someone could probably help but that she couldn’t promise anything. Again I was to wait to get a call back, as she had raised another ticket.”In the meantime, Jude wanted to send a complaint, so she filled in the complaints form. At this stage she was “quite frustrated” but still willing to give Three a chance to show some level of “customer care”. In the mail to Three she described the level of “support” as “terrible” but stressed that she really wanted her 5G she also asked for an extended trial period.In response she received a short email which said: “I have checked with the technical team and as per their investigation there isn’t any issue suspected regarding the network issue. This is a radio-based network and therefore in certain conditions and environs the received signal may not always be received at a constant level.”This time she was told that the person sending the mail was “sorry but we won’t be able to extend any period and also your contract ends on 2023 so it will remain as it is.” The mail also repeated the claim that there “wasn’t any issue suspected” and she was told that “once you are moved to a higher plan you cannot change back to the previous plan as you are bound in contract terms. Unless and until contract expires you can’t move the previous plan. You can move to a higher one.”Well, that might have been the end of it. But then Jude got in touch with us and we had a go.We contacted the company and received the following statement: “At Three, our customers are our number one priority and on this occasion this customer has not experienced the quality of service we strive to deliver, and for this we would like to apologise. “We appreciate that this experience has caused frustration, so we are now working with the customer to resolve all issues and ensure they have the best service. As a gesture, we have offered to cover the cost of their bill for two months and will reinstate the trial period until the customer is satisfied. The customer is happy with this ongoing liaison and outcome.”Sky’s puzzling billing systemNiall Brogan got in touch after reaching his limit with Sky’s billing system. “On Black Friday in 2020 I entered into a contract with Sky for TV and broadband. First off I have no issue with the service but am struggling to understand their billing system,” his mail begins.“The contract was for a monthly charge of €60.23 which had discounts on TV and Broadband. The broadband discounts expired on December 7th, 2021 and the TV on December 24th. This package included Sky Sports. I was advised to call them one month in advance of renewal which I did last Monday, November 1st. This was supposed to prevent the contract rolling over automatically and to discuss renewal terms. I was on the phone talking to the lady for an hour and was totally confused as she kept throwing numbers at me,” he writes.“Anyway, the final outcome was she told me my bill in November would be €173.83, as they bill in advance. I then got an email on November 2nd saying my monthly charge would be €119 including a discount of €26 for the TV from November 24th, 2021 to November 24th, 2022. Thus was included in the original contract. However all other discounts on the Sky sports etc in that original contract were taken away and the base cost has also increased.”He looked at his bills online and noticed that there were extra charges for November and December for the bits of the package that had been discounted initially. “I am assuming that these relate to the portion of the additional costs under the new contract. I would assume that the new contract would only kick in from December as I was simply indicating my willingness to renew the contract, so why the additional costs in the period for November?” He believes he has been “financially penalised for going by the rules. I would like to understand the billing process as the new contract has discounts that expire on the May 2nd, 2022 and others that expire the October 30th, 2022 and want to avoid a similar situation occurring, so when is the best time to call them to renew the current contract?”We got in touch with Sky who got in touch with our reader. Sky has “resolved his query and given some clarity as to what happened here”.And what did happen?“Prior to contacting us, this customer upgraded his package to include Sky Multiroom, HD and Netflix – none of which were part of his initial package (the Black Friday deal last year). When the customer did make contact with one of our agents, he also upgraded his broadband package to 1GB.“The changes made by the customer meant that he was no longer on his original package when he contacted us. One of our agents spoke to the customer today and agreed in good faith to credit the difference to ensure he gets the full 12-month value of the original package.”Runaround to lodge a chequeHave you tried to lodge a cheque recently? Byna Twomey has and she was given an almighty runaround for her troubles. On day one she decides to lodge a Bank of Ireland cheque in a Bank of Ireland branch close to her home. The ATM at the branch doesn’t have a cheque lodgement option when she puts in her card. She is told by a “passing girl” that she needs to have a Bank of Ireland account to be given that option. “Gone. Moved. I give up,” she says.At least for the first day. Then on day two – and still in possession of the unlodged cheque and still in a hurry – she finds a nearby AIB branch that is bigger than the first one and, crucially, still actually functioning as a bank, at least sort of. “There was no teller,” she says. She tries the machine lodgement and is asked for two numbers – her card number and another number which has her a bit confused. She tries to ask a passing staff member what is going on and what she needs to do but she is “too busy to help”.Byna gave up again. Another day, another go at lodging the cheque. She drives to a different AIB branch and writes her name on the back of the cheque. She gives the machine two numbers. Success! Or so she thinks. On day four the cheque is “returned in the post by the bank”.We admire the staccato style deployed by Byna so we will reproduce what she says next in full. “Needs endorsement. What? Return to big new local AIB branch. Talk to nice employee, alone in booth. He says now only selected branches will accept cheques. Ask why banks still provide chequebooks. Phasing out branches. And cheque books. Also look – machines have been removed. Cost-saving by bank. What about people? Service? Head-shake. Nice employee confides he is on rolling contract. Is sad. Almost tearful. Advises take bank card and cheque to local Post Office. Seriously?” Byna then goes to the nearest post office.And guess what? “Gone. Moved. Now inside big supermarket. But happy to take cheque with card. Success! At last! Admittedly, I’m elderly. Not tech savvy. Haven’t been getting out much. But still.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 negotiators agree to strengthen emission targets by end of 2022","story":"Almost 200 countries have agreed a pact to tackle climate change, despite disagreements over phasing out fossil fuels and financial help for poorer countries.Cop26 president Alok Sharma brought the gavel down on a two-week conference in Glasgow after delegates agreed on a text more than 24 hours later than scheduled. In a historic move, fossil fuels feature for the first time in a final Cop decision by way of a call for “accelerating efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. In a dramatic move in the closing minutes of the meeting, India proposed a change to the language, replacing the words “phase out” with “phase down”. Mr Sharma appeared close to tears as he apologised for the way the process had unfolded, saying he was “deeply sorry” but he called on delegates to accept the change and approve the text. “I understand the deep disappointment, but it’s vital that we protect this package,” he said to applause. The European Union expressed disappointment at the change, warning it should not mean that it will take longer to exit from coal. But European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans said that should not stop the conference from endorsing what he described as a historic agreement. Representatives from Fiji and the Marshall Islands also protested against the last-minute change but said they would accept the agreement because it included measures their people needed. CutsThe deal, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, recognises the need for deep emissions cuts this decade in an effort to contain global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees – though commitments made before Cop26 and during the summit have come up short of delivering this. As a consequence, the decision requests countries revisit the targets “as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, taking into account different national circumstances” – and in particular to strengthen 2030 targets next year. In the final hours of negotiation, developing countries – representing over six billion people – pushed for a “loss and damage” finance facility to build back in the aftermath of extreme weather events linked to climate change though there is no financing mechanism secured. This was blocked by wealthy countries though they agreed to limited funding for technical assistance and a “dialogue”. For the first time, a goal for adaptation finance was agreed – which was strongly backed by Ireland during negotiations. The commitment to double funding is below what developing countries asked for and need, but if realised it will increase support to developing countries by billions, according to negotiators. Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan welcomed the agreement as a compromise that kept the goal of 1.5C alive.“What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity. We can only do that by delivering, including keeping our promises in Ireland to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade and to reach net zero by 2050. “However it is deeply disappointing that the proposal to phase out unabated coal and inefficent fossil fuel subsidies has been watered down as part of the compromise needed to agree a deal,” he said.“We also have to deliver on climate justice by seriously addressing loss and damage in countries worst affected – something Ireland is working to progress. Glasgow has injected fresh momentum in the fight against climate change. We now have to go home and prove it will result in real action that protects people and the planet, and provide a just transition and a better economy for all.”WeakJennifer Morgan of Greenpeace International said the declaration was weak, and the 1.5-degree goal “is only just alive”. “But a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters,” the Cop veteran added. “While the deal recognises the need for deep emissions cuts this decade, those commitments have been punted to next year. Glasgow was meant to deliver on firmly closing the gap to 1.5 degrees and that didn’t happen, but in 2022 nations will now have to come back with stronger targets.”Cop26 saw progress on adaptation, with the developed countries finally beginning to respond to the calls of developing countries for funding and resources to cope with rising temperatures, she acknowledged. “There was a recognition that vulnerable countries are suffering real loss and damage from the climate crisis now, but what was promised was nothing close to what’s needed on the ground. This issue must be at the top of the agenda for developed countries as the Cop goes to Egypt next year,” Ms Morgan said.The line on phasing out unabated coal and fossil fuel subsidies “is weak and compromised but its very existence is nevertheless a breakthrough, and the focus on a just transition is essential”, she said. The call for emissions reductions of 45 per cent by the end of this decade “is in line with what we need to do to stay under 1.5 degree and brings the science firmly into this deal. But it needs to be implemented,” Ms Morgan said.On carbon market issues, she said: “The offsets scam got a boost in Glasgow with the creation of new loopholes that are too big to tolerate, endangering nature, indigenous peoples and the 1.5-degree goal itself. The UN Secretary General announced that a group of experts will bring vital scrutiny to offset markets, but much work still needs to be done to stop the greenwashing, cheating and loopholes giving big emitters and corporations a pass.” On the outcome Oxfam International director Gabriela Bucher said: “Clearly some world leaders think they aren’t living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity.”She accepted the request to strengthen 2030 reduction targets by next year was an important step. “The work starts now. Big emitters, especially rich countries, must heed the call and align their targets to give us the best possible chance of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach. “Despite years of talks, emissions continue to rise, and we are dangerously close to losing this race against time.” Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: “In the last fortnight, the climate justice movement that came out in force in Glasgow and around the world became mainstream. “We showed that you can’t tackle climate change without a radical transformation of the global economy and reparations from those who fuelled climate change to those facing its worst impacts,” he said.“But this hollowed-out agreement shows that, for all the lip service they paid, world leaders and big business have not listened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney locates psychedelic fungi in the context of culture, therapy and dangerStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 outcome nowhere near enough say irish campaigners","story":"A protest over climate change in Dublin last week.

Photograph: Damien StoranPAThe outcome of Cop26 falls far short of what is necessary to tackle the climate crisis, but countries who are climate leaders must show the way forward, “and let history judge the laggards”, according to Friends of the Earth Ireland (FoE).Irish climate NGOs and overseas aid organisations expressed disappointment about the outcome of the UN climate summit in Glasgow, though some welcomed gains on climate finance for poorer countries and increased funding for “adaptation” to help make climate-vulnerable states more resilient in face of inevitable impacts from global warming.“Glasgow was a staging post not a finishing line,” said FoE director Oisín Coghlan. He said what was clear now was that formal negotiations through this UN process “may never produce an outcome that reflects the urgency of the science and the imperative of justice. Not when the final text is effectively subject to a veto from any polluting country with a brass neck”.Collective agreement is no longer the limit on global action it once was, Mr Coghlan said. “While some countries are still dragging their heels others are beginning to pick up the pace. Equally, while fossil fuel companies are lobbying for the path of delay and destruction others are grasping the business opportunities of the race to zero.”The global climate movement was growing in strength and ersity, and this would continue in an effort to secure a better response by governments, he said.“We may not yet have succeeded in forging the international agreement we want but increasingly we can hold our national governments to the standards required by the 1.5-degree goal in the Paris agreement.“The two-steps forward, one-step back nature of the annual climate talks is deeply frustrating but we must pocket any modest gains from Glasgow – the first mention of phasing out of fossil fuels and the renewed commitment to adaptation finance for example – and ratchet up our demands for the next time,” he added.“Collectively our governments have not met the moment but our international movement emerges from Glasgow stronger than ever. We return home to push our national governments harder than ever to act in line with science and equity.”Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of international figures founded by Nelson Mandela, pushed repeatedly for greater ambition during the two-week long negotiations. She said it had made some progress, “but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty”.Climate activist Dr Lorna Gold, chairwoman of the Laudato Si Movement, said the outcome was a huge disappointment. “The only thing worse than this would have been no outcome. That would have spelt disaster. The outcome shows that the majority of leaders still do not yet fully accept the reality of the situation.”Last-minute watering down of critical language on phasing out coal deepened mistrust and did bode well for the road ahead, she added. “That said, this Cop was not just about the official outcome. Many key initiatives have been signed – including the agreement on methane and Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, to which Ireland signed up.”On the fringes, however, critical discussions were held on financial realignment, including value-based organisations rapidly shifting financial assets into clean energy and adaptation, she noted. “The awakening of global finance is good news. Cop26 has not been a disaster – but not a success either. Some would call it a ‘compromise’ – a ‘balanced outcome’. Sadly, a rapidly changing climate does not react to such human excuses.”The failure of global leaders to include “loss and damage” financing in the final agreement is “deeply disappointing” and a “missed opportunity” by the powerful nations who have contributed most to climate change, according to Trócaire.The overseas development agency said the deal failed to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities recover and rebuild after climate disasters.Trócaire head of policy and advocacy Siobhán Curran, who attended Cop26, said: “There were huge expectations that Cop26 would be the moment when wealthy countries stepped up and acknowledged they have done most to cause the climate crisis. They have turned their backs on indigenous communities, small-scale farmers, women and girls who desperately need support to recover and rebuild after climate disasters. This is a matter of great injustice.”Ms Curran said although the commitment to “urgently deliver” $100 billion (€87 billion) for climate finance was welcome, it is still a fraction of the amount that will be needed in the face of the climate emergency.Trócaire chief executive Caoimhe de Barra said: “This was an exclusionary Cop. Civil society found it difficult to access the Cop sessions, and many were excluded from the negotiation area.“People from the global South and countries most affected by the climate crisis were under-represented . . . yet they are the most affected communities and their voices needed to be heard.”Simon Murtagh of Oxfam Ireland said: “At every level, Cop26 did not deliver the goals we sought urgent action on. The process couldn’t deliver for small island states facing immediate destruction. Nor could it deliver for two million Kenyans currently left destitute by the effects of climate change, nor for millions more in Yemen, Madagascar or central America, who face hunger and destitution caused by climate change.”"},{"url":null,"title":"imperfect cop26 deal builds platform for hastening climate action","story":"Exhausted Cop26 delegates as they emerged from the final plenary after two weeks of talks. Photograph: Robert PerryEPAAs they emerged from the final plenary after two weeks of talks, exhausted Cop26 negotiators – some shocked at last-minute compromise on the vexatious issue of coal – knew they’d been through a bruising battle where “uncomfortable” compromise marked the outcome.In spite of this, tangible commitments, and even progressive moves to shift course, were nailed down. For the first time a Cop agreement targets fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming. The tone is much different to the usual arcane language of UN climate summit outcomes. The 2015 Paris Agreement is finally moving to gearing-up stage.There is no doubt now that keeping global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees is the priority of the 197 signatory countries, who can no longer put vague commitments on the table in the hope that the world might warm by less than two degrees.Emerging into the Glasgow daylight probably provided a far greater shock for negotiating teams, especially political leaders heading up delegations, as the reaction was marked by a wave of deep disappointment. Reaction in climate-vulnerable states can be summed up by one word – despair.Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan admitted that dramatic twist was “gut wrenching” as India – the world’s third biggest emitter – pushed for “phase down” rather than “phase out” of coal. This prompted a rushed manoeuvre by the European Union, China and United States to amend the text in the interests of holding “what we’ve got”, though it was against protocols and the final political, rather than legal, decision was already agreed going into the final plenary.The critical target of keeping global warming to within 1.5 degrees was still alive, Cop26 president Alok Sharma insisted a view backed by those big players.“What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity,” Ryan said.Unfinished businessMuch unfinished business, however, is confirmed by definitive analysis published in Glasgow showing all promises made before and at the UN summit make for a 2.4 degree rise in temperatures, where already dangerous climate impacts would become catastrophic.“For many countries, two degrees is a death sentence,” executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa said.The deal backs “best available science” to inform actions. Applying that framework, there is no sugar-coating the standout failure of ambition on actions to curb emissions, leaving our fragile planet still hanging by a thread.That said, there is enough to suggest the world is facing into a decade of scaled-up action. In that scenario the request that parties “revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022” becomes the key enabler. A request in “UN speak” is close to a demand.The temperature issue aside, this was the most productive Cop since Paris. Decisions on doubling adaptation finance and setting up a body to assist countries most impacted by climate disruption represents progress, but more is needed.When it comes to hard money, the long-awaited $100 billion a year for developing countries under climate finance will be realised, while adaptation funding to help vulnerable countries adjust for inevitable climate impacts is set to be in excess of $1 trillion a year by 2025.While Cop26 failed to generate dedicated finance for “loss and damage” because of resistance by wealthy countries, vulnerable countries agreed to compromise on the understanding more help would come soon. Ireland has offered to co-host a “dialogue” to come up with ways of supporting those most affected.The outcome also finalises the most contentious elements of the Paris Agreement rule book, encapsulated in article six, six years after the landmark deal was done. This includes facilitation of a global carbon-trading market that closes glaring loopholes such as “double counting” of carbon credits.CompromiseA historic proposal to “phase out unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” was watered down part of the compromise needed to agree a deal by inserting “phase down”. It has left a bad aftertaste, especially for the EU.The reality, however, is the economics of coal-powered electricity generation no longer add up in face of cheap solar and wind energy. The coal industry that once brought wealth to the developed world is coming to a rapid end, probably by 2030. Developing countries are predicted to follow the same course over the following decade.Outside the COP process, groups of countries committed to ending fossil fuel extraction, to accelerate the phasing out of coal, to tackling methane and to ending deforestation. If all of this is delivered, acceleration of decarbonisation over the coming decade is realisable. New alliances between public and private sectors have been forged, especially on switching to green energy. There was also a strong indication that the financial world is gearing up for transitioning to a world of net-zero emissions.Analysis by Climate Action Tracker and the International Energy Agency indicate fresh pledges made over the past fortnight have the potential to reduce global warming by 0.5 degrees – a significant stride toward the 1.5 target.Delivery reinforced by meaningful near-term commitments is critical. Being unable to bend the emissions curve downwards this decade will put huge pressure on the remaining carbon budget for “keeping 1.5 degrees alive”.The Cop26 outcome has been described as a political lifeline for accelerating action to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees, but science indicates forcing down the global emissions curve in just nine years is essential.As climate scientist Prof John Sweeney has highlighted, the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has four out of five possible scenarios which indicate the world will exceed 1.5 degrees over the next 20 years.The one that keeps us to within 1.5 degrees is a trajectory the world is nowhere near at present. It will be some years before we know if Cop26 has helped bridge the gap.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Saint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"shamima begum should not allowed return suggests former jihadi","story":"The first British woman to be convicted of joining Islamic State has suggested Shamima Begum should not be allowed to return to the UK, because she only tried to come home after the brutal terror group had collapsed.Tareena Shakil, 32, from Birmingham, travelled to Syria in 2014 with her young son in order to join Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil).But after spending several months living under the murderous regime, she became disillusioned and escaped.She was arrested when she landed at Heathrow Airport in 2015 and was later jailed for six years for being a member of Isil and encouraging acts of terror on social media.In her first interview since being released from prison, Shakil said she regretted her actions, but added: I was far from the best version of myself.Asked what should happen to other British Isil volunteers, such as Shamima Begum, who is now appealing to return to the UK, Shakil expressed reservations about allowing her to do so.Speaking on an ITV documentary, Tareena: Return from ISIS, she said: I can\u0027t sit here and say – no don\u0027t bring them back – because that makes me a hypocrite, because I\u0027ve been in a very similar situation.But she added: It\u0027s not the same situation because I escaped, chose to leave when ISIS were at their peak, as opposed to waiting for the fall of ISIS and then saying: I want to come home.Shakil went on: Having said that, there may be reasons that these people didn\u0027t escape from there. I know that. It takes strength, it takes courage, like it’s life and death, not everybody has it in them to go for that.Begum, who left the UK aged 15 and joined Isil, married a jihadist fighter and had three children, all of whom died.She is currently being held in a detention centre in north east Syria and is challenging the Government\u0027s decision to revoke her British citizenship .Shakil and Begum are among around 900 British nationals who travelled to Syria to join or fight for Isil, including dozens of so-called Jihadi brides.Shakil admitted she had been aware of the brutal executions being carried out by Isil fighters before she decided to travel there with her one-year-old son and acknowledges she made a terrible mistake.I was aware of violence that had taken place at the hands of ISIS, you know I can’t lie and say that I didn’t because it was everywhere, she said.Being aware of horrific things that were happening in that place and still deciding to run away, not just on your own, with your child.It’s not something that I’m happy about now looking back, but at the time the only thing I can say is that you know, I was far from the best version of myself, she added.Shakil admitted that her relationship with her son has been difficult but has said she hopes it will improve in the future.I came home and I was seeing him in a contact centre and he really didn’t want anything to do with me.I would kiss him, he’d wipe the kiss off. He’d ask: when am I going home?We’ve gone from that to a really good relationship, to the point where he tells me he loves me, he asks me if I can go and see him every day.Tareena: Return From ISIS is now available via the ITV Hub.More from NewsAt the coalface of climate change: The most polluted place in IndiaDelhi imposes ‘pollution lockdown’ as air quality in the capital plummetsPolitics latest news: Booster vaccines best protection against Covid \u0026#39blizzard\u0026#39 this Christmas, says Boris JohnsonAlexander Monson: Kenya policemen guilty of manslaughter in British aristocrat\u0026#39s deathDon\u0026#39t underestimate the risk of conflict with RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine booster jabs rolled over 40s","story":"Coronavirus booster jabs are to be rolled out to those in their 40s, after research found a third dose could cut infection rates by 80 per cent. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said everyone in their 40s would be asked to come forward six months after their second jab. The rollout of second doses to those in their 40s began in June, meaning many of those in the cohort will become eligible before Christmas. Until now, boosters have been offered only to those in priority groups, including all over-50s. So far 12.6million have had booster jabs, but around 32million will be eligible by the end of this year. Opening up boosters to those in their 40s means another 8million people will be able to book jabs, scheduling them for six months after their second dose. The JCVI has also announced that 16- and 17-year-olds will be offered second doses. The rollout of jabs to this group began in August. Officials said that they will be given a gap of at least 12 weeks between doses, to maximise the efficacy of the dose, and reduce the risk of side effects.Their research found nine per million cases of myocarditis - a rare type of heart inflammation - in those under the age of 18 who received vaccinations. Most people in this age group have only received one dose. The rate was 21 per million for those aged 18-to-29 for the first dose, and 20 per million for the second dose.Dr June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, said: “We welcome today’s announcement by the JCVI, on the extension of the booster campaign to 40- to 49-year-olds. This further strengthens our ability to ensure people are protected against Covid-19 and saves lives. “Our safety monitoring to date shows that Covid-19 vaccines continue to have a positive safety profile for the majority of people. The vast majority of reactions that are reported relate to expected side effects such as injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms, as was seen in our initial assessment. Our proactive monitoring of the safety of booster doses does not raise any new concerns. We also welcome the recommendation for 16- to 17-year-olds to come forward and have a second dose of the PfizerBioNTech vaccine. People can be reassured that when we gave approval for the Pfizer vaccine for those 16 years and over in December 2020, we had thoroughly reviewed all the clinical trial data.Health officials said results from the first UK real world study by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) show significantly increased protection against symptomatic disease from a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in those aged 50 years and older. These findings show that two weeks after receiving a booster dose, protection against symptomatic infection in adults aged 50 years and over was 93.1 per cent in those with AstraZeneca as their primary course and 94.0 per cent for Pfizer-BioNTech. After a primary course of AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, effectiveness against symptomatic disease appears to wear off with time. Scientists said that overall, vaccine effectiveness against severe outcomes such as hospital admission remains high for several months after completing the primary course, but greater waning has been seen in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions compared with young, healthy adults. Dr Mary Ramsay, the head of immunisation at the UK Health Security Agency, said: “Our findings demonstrate the protection provided by the booster dose against symptomatic infection in those at highest risk from developing severe ovid-19. We know that in older age groups, protection from the first two vaccines is beginning to wear off, leaving millions that need extra protection as we head into winter. That is why it is critical that you come forward for your booster as soon as you become eligible so we can drive down hospitalisations and deaths over the winter.”More from NewsAt the coalface of climate change: The most polluted place in IndiaDelhi imposes ‘pollution lockdown’ as air quality in the capital plummetsPolitics latest news: Booster vaccines best protection against Covid \u0026#39blizzard\u0026#39 this Christmas, says Boris JohnsonAlexander Monson: Kenya policemen guilty of manslaughter in British aristocrat\u0026#39s deathDon\u0026#39t underestimate the risk of conflict with RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow need net zero referendum","story":"The Glasgow climate conference represents a strategic defeat for the West and for Britain in particular. Boris Johnson threw the kitchen sink at it. The Royal Family hosted receptions for multi-billionaires. The Foreign Office sent climate envoys around the world. Glasgow would show the world that what France could do six years ago at the Paris climate conference, Britain could do better. But whereas the French knew what they were doing in Paris, the British were all at sea in Glasgow. The result was a display of the rank amateurishness of the British state. Unsurprisingly, it ended in tears. Literally.If Boris Johnson and his ministers had done their homework, they would have known they were on a hiding to nothing. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol failed because it excluded the developing world from cutting their emissions. The West attempted to remedy this at the Copenhagen climate conference in 2009 with a climate treaty that would bring the major emerging economies under a multilateral regime of emissions targets and timetables. The attempt was sunk by China, India, South Africa and Brazil acting in concert.The West needed some sort of climate agreement to justify their domestic climate policies. Global warming is global. The West accounts for a declining share of global emissions. “This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,” Barack Obama had boasted in 2008. Obama and the West were desperate for a climate agreement, even a fig leaf of one. The Paris agreement is the climate equivalent of Mikhail Gorbachev’s Sinatra Doctrine under which the captive nations of eastern Europe could do it their way. It signalled that the Soviet Union had lost the Cold War. In similar fashion, the Paris agreement signalled that the West had accepted its defeat and had given up its attempt to create a multilateral regime of emissions cuts. Instead, the Paris agreement is based on nationally determined contributions. Each party to the agreement would do it its way.Because Paris included 1.5 in its text, the IPCC brought forward the indicative timetable for net zero from the second half of the current century to 2050. In the dying days of her premiership, Theresa May decided to make net zero her legacy. In 2019, it was incorporated as a binding target under the 2008 Climate Change Act after a ninety-minute debate in the House of Commons, even though MPs had no idea how much it would cost or whether it was remotely feasible. But one thing is clear. However much net zero costs Britain, it is pointless for Britain to decarbonise if the rest of the world doesn’t. The regulatory impact assessment accompanying the Climate Change Act signed by Ed Miliband as climate and energy secretary could not have been clearer: “The UK continuing to act while the rest of the world does not, would result in a large net cost for the UK.” The benefits of UK climate action would be distributed around the world, but the UK would bear all the costs.The Climate Change Act was passed in the run up to the Copenhagen climate conference which was going to produce a binding climate treaty. “Showing leadership through the Climate Change Act, the UK will help to drive a global deal,” Miliband asserted, showing that climate hubris is embraced by all Britain’s political parties. Now, for a second time, a UN climate conference has produced a dud. The mantra of Britain leading and the rest of the world following has ended in tears and in humiliation. The question mark over net zero has been answered. After Glasgow, we now know that net zero is all pain for no gain. With Britain’s political class committed to the dead end of net zero, they will not act to take Britain off this disastrous path. Roll on a net zero referendum.Rupert Darwall is a senior fellow of the RealClear Foundation and author of Green Tyranny.More from NewsAt the coalface of climate change: The most polluted place in IndiaDelhi imposes ‘pollution lockdown’ as air quality in the capital plummetsPolitics latest news: Booster vaccines best protection against Covid \u0026#39blizzard\u0026#39 this Christmas, says Boris JohnsonAlexander Monson: Kenya policemen guilty of manslaughter in British aristocrat\u0026#39s deathDon\u0026#39t underestimate the risk of conflict with RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mid term poll lead not triumph labour","story":"In early December 1981, as Britain reeled from the deepest recession since the 1930s and unemployment neared three million, private polling for the Conservatives estimated the party’s support at an all-time low of 23 per cent. By March 1982, after Geoffrey Howe delivered a budget that (at least compared with the previous year’s) was welcomed by most voters, Margaret Thatcher’s party had regained a four point lead over Labour (37-33), with the SDPLiberal Alliance falling to a combined total of 26 per cent.Conventional political wisdom maintains that it was the Falklands that saved Thatcher’s government from defeat at the 1983 general election. But her recovery in the polls predated the territorial land grab by Galtieri’s fascists. Labour’s self-indulgent internecine warfare at the time would have swept the Conservative to re-election even if the Falklands had never been invaded, thanks largely to Tony Benn’s almost single-handed efforts to confound the old adage that “oppositions don’t win elections, governments lose them”.Hindsight, it is often claimed, has 2020 vision, but when it comes to the Thatcher era, that tends not to be the case. The then prime minister, at least in her early years in office, was not the mistress of all she surveyed, consistently polling well behind both Labour and the nascent SDP. Who recalls now that in the early days of Michael Foot’s leadership, Labour held a double-digit lead over the Conservatives?Political history is seen through the prism of elections, and the 1983 contest told a fairly unequivocal story about Thatcher’s success and Labour’s failures, just as the 1997 election defined events leading up to it, as well as the events that followed. As Conservative MPs consider recent opinion polling and the fact that a number of snapshot polls have given Labour the lead, the question they should be asking themselves is: does this feel like 1996 or 1986?Has Boris Johnson’s unforced error over parliamentary standards and the subsequent drip-feed of inidual Tory MPs behaving badly produced a sea change in voter perceptions akin to the final years of John Major’s administration, when the “cash for questions” scandal removed all doubt about the need for a change of government? Or does this feel more like the Westland crisis ten years earlier, when Thatcher was brought to the brink of disaster, only to recover and lead her party to its second consecutive three-figure landslide majority?Ministers will, of course, be hoping for a repeat of the latter, just as Labour is betting the house on the former. Listening to Labour-supporting friends talk excitedly about recent polling inclines me to counsel caution. The fact that having a poll lead at all is such a new and exciting experience tells its own story about how the party is performing.Furthermore, just as Thatcher’s 1983 victory could well have happened without Argentina’s intervention, so sleaze in the 1990s was not the sole, or even the main, cause of Labour’s 1997 triumph. The party had been enjoying an insurmountable double-digit polling lead for nearly four years by the time Neil Hamilton became the nation’s least favourite politician and would have won even if “cash for questions” had never happened.In times of Covid, Brexit, culture wars and tax rises, parliamentary sleaze – especially since it’s on a measurably smaller scale than 1996 or the expenses scandal of 2009 – will not turn out to be the salient factor in the next general election. In other words, Labour MPs need to get two things: a grip, and some perspective. Instead of focusing on a few recent snapshot polls, they would do well to consider that when ministers came under fire and were second guessed for virtually every decision they took to deal with Covid, as they presided over an unprecedented and unexpected economic slump, as hundreds of thousands of people died in hospital and at home, the Conservatives maintained their lead as voters’ preferred party of government.Such a dominant position is not the norm. While in power, parties are expected to be playing catch-up with the opposition, right up until the point where an election hoves into view and voters finally focus on their priorities for the next four years. Polling deficits are not the end of the world or even for the governing party. Not yet, anyway.A similar lesson should be learned by Labour. They should be thankful that they are at last enjoying some success. But they should recall that after more than two years of banging his head against a brick wall as leader of the opposition, Neil Kinnock found himself, briefly, the beneficiary of the government’s woes over the Westland helicopter factory, woes that resulted in the resignation of two cabinet ministers and almost toppled Thatcher herself. A poll at the time predicted a 65-seat Labour majority in the event of an election being held immediately.But an election was not held immediately. It was held more than a year later and we know what the result of that was. In 1986 Thatcher and her ministers got their act together. Kinnock and his shadow team did not, choosing instead to regurgitate the same old political and economic arguments they had been making, unsuccessfully, for the last few years.Labour cannot win an election on the back of “Tory sleaze”, however helpful to their cause such headlines are. They will win if they have an inspiring and popular leader and if their shadow ministers say and do the right things. Just as the Tories will not lose because of Owen Paterson or Sir Geoffrey Cox. There is plenty of time to regroup before an election. Panicking over polls is an indulgence the Conservative Party cannot afford. Though it would certainly help the Government if they could just stop making stupid mistakes.More from NewsAt the coalface of climate change: The most polluted place in IndiaDelhi imposes ‘pollution lockdown’ as air quality in the capital plummetsPolitics latest news: Booster vaccines best protection against Covid \u0026#39blizzard\u0026#39 this Christmas, says Boris JohnsonAlexander Monson: Kenya policemen guilty of manslaughter in British aristocrat\u0026#39s deathDon\u0026#39t underestimate the risk of conflict with RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"take dogs waste home withyou national trust says removes bins","story":"The National Trust has removed waste bins to force dog walkers to clean up after their pets.The charity has reported an increase in dog owners visiting a beauty spot in East Hampshire, and an equally sharp increase in dog waste being left in on-site bins, which overstretched staff can not empty quickly enough.The National Trust said waste bags have been left scattered on the ground and hanging from trees as a result of bins being full, and the charity has now taken the decision to remove all bins to force owners to take their pets\u0027 mess home with them.Matt Bramich, head ranger for ­Ludshott Common, said: Due to the huge increase in dog walkers using the common in the past year, we have really struggled to keep up with the disposal of dog waste left in our bins, on top of all our other duties.Emptying them costs the charity a lot of money, and we\u0027re still unable to keep on top of the problem.They fill up more quickly than we can empty them.It\u0027s a sad and sorry way to treat a beautiful place like this, and it causes a health and safety risk to other visitors and to our staff.As a charity, we have limited funds for waste disposal, so as a result, we have made the difficult decision that the dog waste bins on Ludshott Common will be removed.We want people to visit the common, to enjoy this beautiful landscape and its wildlife, but we need dog owners to help us look after it by picking up after their dog and taking their dog waste home with them.The National Trust\u0027s problem follows a national trend, with increased dog ownership over lockdown leading to an increase in the amount of waste bags being dumped by pet owners.Many pets were bought to help people cope with loneliness during lockdown, and some research has suggested a 200 per cent rise in dog waste on UK streets since the pandemic began, even though the majority of pet owners were found to clean up after their animals.Concerns have been raised in the past about the impact of increased excrement in public spaces, with experts fearing both hygiene and the environment could suffer as a result of waste and plastic bags being left in streets and parks.Ludshott Common, which at 735 acres is one of the largest remaining areas of heathland in East Hampshire, had seen a rise in visitors over the pandemic. As well as an unmanageable increase in dog waste, the rangers also reported more littering, fly-tipping, destruction of pathways due to increased footfall, and altercations between livestock and pet dogs.More from NewsAt the coalface of climate change: The most polluted place in IndiaDelhi imposes ‘pollution lockdown’ as air quality in the capital plummetsPolitics latest news: Booster vaccines best protection against Covid \u0026#39blizzard\u0026#39 this Christmas, says Boris JohnsonAlexander Monson: Kenya policemen guilty of manslaughter in British aristocrat\u0026#39s deathDon\u0026#39t underestimate the risk of conflict with RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"woke hr officials taking country","story":"The Stonewall scandal shows us who really runs this country: human resources. Many years ago, Stonewall, the LGBTQ charity, won all its battles and helped transform British society – such that when companies and bureaucracies wanted to guarantee their workplaces were “inclusive”, they hired Stonewall to show them how. Stonewall marked their homework via a league table of the most welcoming places to work.But some of the things this organisation believes in are more controversial than employers might realise or Stonewall is willing to admit (in particular that people can change their sexgender and society needs to respect this), and Stonewall seeks to shape the law in ways that many voters reject. This means that government departments employing the group could be accused of paying it to lobby them, which is downright surreal.Moreover, when an organisation commits itself to a bold internal policy then it’s logical to assume that this will have an effect upon its outward mission, too. Pronouns, flags and a fervour for ersity all have an effect.The NHS has spent almost £500,000 seeking Stonewall’s advice in the past three years. We essentially banned mixed wards in hospitals in 2010 Stonewall thinks people should be able to recuperate on wards that reflect their self-defined gender. An investigation by the  discovered that many NHS trusts across the country agree, meaning that patients can choose which ward, lavatory or shower facilities they use. Patients who dislike this have been labelled transphobic guidelines have compared them to racists, even suggesting they be reported to the police.I’m not claiming a direct link between what Stonewall favours and what organisations that have hired it end up doing, because the process is far subtler. If you change the culture of an institution then policy will logically track that development, which is what I mean when I joke that the staff in HR now run Britain. The BBC, for instance, is officially committed to editorial impartiality, but were it committed internally to the view that every trans campaign is an uncontroversial human rights cause, this would render such an editorial policy contradictory and immoral: you cannot be impartial about human rights. Power thus shifts from the traditional “face” of an institution – the editors and senior journalists – and towards those members of staff who inform and, inevitably, police internal policy. Last year, an editor at the Philadelphia Inquirer stepped down after a headline bemoaning riot damage prompted a walkout. Around 30 members of staff claimed they were too “sick and tired” to work.It is not inconceivable that a university lecturer could find themselves drummed out of their job for saying something “offensive” on campus that they simultaneously published in a book the fact that the university exists to air ideas is irrelevant. Kathleen Stock, the well-published professor at Sussex, whom trans activists tried to get sacked, enjoyed oodles of media political endorsement even the backing of her employer. Yet she still felt compelled to quit because her life became so unpleasant. To nine-tenths of us, nothing she said was controversial and it certainly wasn’t illegal, making this episode all the more frightening. Authoritarianism is perfectly possible in a free society. It can flourish independently of the law or organs of the state, even in direct contradiction to the stated philosophy of the government in power, which brings us to the court of King Boris.Many institutions, including the department of health and the BBC, have now walked away from Stonewall’s ersity scheme, but the vibe around the PM is reportedly rather different. No 10 is sticking with a partnership with Stonewall to run a conference, and critics allege that advisers are presenting Boris with “skewed” advice on trans rights that might persuade him that the argument has been won in Stonewall’s favour. Democracy itself is being bypassed by the staff.Yet the BBC has let the cat out of the bag. Denying that its journalism has been influenced by Stonewall, the BBC has helpfully defined the trans issue not as holy writ but, in its Solomonic judgment, a “matter of public policy” – ie, an ongoing, contentious discussion that justifies balance. If this is true then we should all feel free to debate this stuff in a civilised manner – eschewing moral panic and with respect to all sides.One person I’d be up for censoring is my dog, who has found his voice. He discovered it by accident about a month ago and has been making the most of it ever since. Fireworks and car engines – I can understand why those merit a woof. But I’ll never understand why the same boy who greets other dogs in the park with a cheerful wag turns into a foul-mouthed hooligan when he sees them on television.The barking is, of course, an attempt to set the agenda. If I’m working and he’s bored, Bertie will affect to see a burglar through the window and let rip. He barks to let me know I’m late for dinner he barks to go to bed. The one time he doesn’t bark is in the morning he feels, if anything, that I get up too early. He barks if I go out, but after a few minutes – I know this because I retrace my steps and listen in – he stops and goes to sleep, relieved that he no longer has to entertain or protect me.More from NewsAt the coalface of climate change: The most polluted place in IndiaDelhi imposes ‘pollution lockdown’ as air quality in the capital plummetsPolitics latest news: Booster vaccines best protection against Covid \u0026#39blizzard\u0026#39 this Christmas, says Boris JohnsonAlexander Monson: Kenya policemen guilty of manslaughter in British aristocrat\u0026#39s deathDon\u0026#39t underestimate the risk of conflict with RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"300000 workers line living wage","story":", workers in line for Living Wage boost but millions of Brits stuck on low paySome , employers are accredited by the Living Wage Foundation - but . million employees are still paid below the rate they set Image: Getty Images iStockphotoByRachel WearmouthSenior Political Correspondent:,  Nov | comments Staff who work for employers who back the real living wage are in line for a pay boost this week as the rate is hiked to meet the rising cost of living. Over , Living Wage workers are set for a pay boost, as the rate rises to £. across the UK - a p increase - and £. in London - a p increase. Some , employers are accredited by the Living Wage Foundation but the organisation says that . million employees, some  in  workers, are still paid below the rate they set. Major new Living Wage employers announced today include FTSE  construction firms Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon Homes, Fujitsu, food delivery company Getir, and Capita.The Living Wage is calculated independently by the foundation and, unlike the lower National Living Wage, is set based on what the average person can live on.  The foundation is marking Living Wage Week from today and has underlined fears a spike in inflation and tax rises next year look set to push some of the lowest paid into food and fuel poverty.Katherine Chapman, Living Wage Foundation Director, said: “With living costs rising so rapidly, today’s new Living Wage rates will provide hundreds of thousands of workers and their families with greater security and stability.“For the past  years the Living Wage movement has shaped the debate on low pay, showing what is possible when responsible employers step up and provide a wage that delivers dignity.Despite this, there are still millions trapped in working poverty, struggling to keep their heads above water – and these are people working in jobs that kept society going during the pandemic like social care workers and cleaners.We know that the Living Wage is good for businesses as well as workers, and as we rebuild our economy post pandemic, the real Living Wage must be at its heart.”The Archbishop of York, the Most Revd Stephen Cottrell, who backs the campaign, said: “The principle behind the campaign for better pay and secure working conditions ought to be a pillar of our new society, and one I hope will be adopted by even more forward-thinking businesses as we look ahead to .”  But TUC General Secretary Frances OaposGrady said the report showed that low pay was endemic, with millions of workers in jobs that donapost pay the bills or put food on the table. She added: After  years of Conservative government, real wages are only just getting back to their  level, and the Budget revealed we face another half decade of wage stagnation. With Britain in the middle of a cost-of-living crunch, itaposs time for the Government to act. Ministers must start by increasing the minimum wage to £ immediately, banning zero hours contracts and giving trade unions greater access to workplaces to negotiate improved pay and conditions.

Covid- Families For Justice warn the former Health Secretary he should not look to rewrite history and cast himself as some sort of hero. It comes amid reports HarperCollins had approached the MP for West Suffolk, who was forced to resign after being snapped breaking his own Covid rules by embracing aide Gina Coladangelo. According to a report in the Daily Mail, the book offer is designed to allow the former top Tory to tell his version of events of what went on inside Government as the pandemic struck, and the subsequent search for and rollout of the vaccines. The publisher has flatly denied the report and said it has no knowledge of such a book.  But the campaign group, which represents some , families, has written to the publisher urging them to rule out publishing any such book. It comes ahead of the public inquiry into the Governmentaposs disastrous handling of the pandemic, which is due to start in the spring. Susie Flitham, spokeswoman for the families, said: Harper Collins have a real opportunity to show that somethings are more important than opportunistic sales. The very notion that the former health secretary, who presided over the worst public health disaster ever, should receive a single penny to be able to rewrite history and cast himself as some sort of hero before an inquiry has even started is not only an insult to us as the bereaved, but frankly tramples on our lost loved ones memory. Mr Hancock needs to sit down and put together all the emails from his private Gmail regarding his dealings with the pandemic rather than think of ways to attempt to salvage his rightfully tarnished reputation.  As a man who prior to the pandemic was most famous for having built an app in homage to himself we possibly shouldnapost be surprised about his clear obsession with his self-image but his continued disrespect and ignorance towards the bereaved community somehow never fails to cause hurt. Weaposd be more than happy to meet with Mr Hancock to explain to him how his actions are painful to us but for some reason heaposs never once accepted our invites to meet. A spokeswoman for Mr Hancock had said: “Matt has been approached to write a book about his experiences in the pandemic, but no decisions have been made.There is no deal. The people who were heroic during the pandemic were the NHS staff who worked round the clock to save lives.”Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said on Twitter about the report: “It is absolutely disgusting that Matt Hancock gets to put his spin on events – and his failures – for a bumper pay day before bereaved families get the truth about the government’s failures and mishandling of the pandemic in a public inquiry.”In a separate statement, a Labour spokesman said: “The Cabinet Office should block the publication of this tasteless cashing in on tragedy.” HarperCollins has said: As we told the Mail before it ran its story about HarperCollins and Matt Hancock, we have no knowledge of such a book and are not in talks. The story is incorrect.

Heres everything you need to know about the -page plan dubbed Operation RampdownThe Covid exit strategy codenamed Operation Rampdown considers ways to cut down on Covid protocols Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika Padin:,  Nov | commentsA secret Whitehall plan detailing a new Covid exit strategy has reportedly been leaked to The Mail on Sunday. Marked as ‘Official Sensitive’, the plan is believed to have been drawn up by the senior Government officials tasked with winding down Britainaposs battle against the Covid pandemic. The report gives a glimpse of how le might look post-Covid.According to a source, the documents dubbed Operation Rampdown reveals officials are examining aposwhat activities can we start ramping down before April apos and what the aposend stateapos of Britainaposs response to Covid should be after April.The Rampdown strategy is expected to detail how much of the Governmentaposs £ billion emergency programme funding will be dismantled. Here are five things you need to know about the Covid exit strategy. Self-isolation could be axedThe strict rules that force those who test positive for Covid to self-isolate could be scrapped under the exit strategy. The self-isolation laws were extended last September, meaning those who caught the virus and any unvaccinated people who were exposed to it were required to self-isolate for ten days. It suggests that there will no longer be a need for mandatory isolation once legal powers expire in March. This could also mean that the scheme that pays out £ to the low-income groups self-isolating will also be axed. No more free Covid tests Under the Covid response plan, anyone can request free lateral flow tests which will be delivered at home.But this universal free Covid testing could be scrapped under the Rampdown strategy. Instead, the dossier reveals that officials maybe preparing to kick-start a aposprivate testing marketapos in which companies will charge people for tests. This could see around  firms offering  dferent testing products are already apparently undergoing the accreditation process. ‘Test and Trace’ system might be shut down The national Test and Trace service, which was set up in May  and handed a £billion budget to identy those exposed to the virus, is expected to be dramatically cut next year. The responsibility to trace infections could be handed over from the NHS and local authorities. Contact tracing was the responsibility of local public health officials before the pandemic.Focus on tackling local outbreaks Ministers will be presented with a list of aposcore sapos that will be needed to respond to any future devastating outbreak. This includes new plans codenamed Rising Tide, which details how to respond to any new mutant strain of the virus arriving in the UK. Learning to live with Covid at aposendemicapos levels for years The virus is expected to remain widespread within the population, but the documents details that Britain will have to learn to ‘live with the virus.’ The aim of any future government strategies is likely to be treating Covid like any other respiratory infection or seasonal flu. Everything about the exit strategy is still speculation, with a Government spokesman clarying last night that the future plans to tackle Covid remain under review and that no decisions have been taken about next year.

For too long, mental health has been ignored, treated as less important than physical health. But attitudes have changed and we all realise its importance. All, it seems, except the Government. The last decade or so of Tory rule has seen mental health provision slashed to the bone. Services have gone, units closed, beds disappeared. Those in charge have been careless. It’s bad enough during normal times. But in a pandemic it’s downright dangerous.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Now the seeds they have sown are bearing fruit. Last year every hospital had , people in a mental health crisis brought to AE by ambulance. That’s a % jump since . The system couldn’t cope anyway. Now it’s breaking. Ambulances are backing up outside hospitals, waiting lists are at all-time highs, paramedics and police are struggling to cope. The solutions are clear: proper funding for health services and proper provision for mental health, a revolution in social care, better pay and conditions for our health service staff. It’s a lot, but this Government has a knack of finding money when it needs to. This isn’t for a trip to the Cayman Islands though. This is big money to save our NHS, end the mental health crisis and enable our health service do what it does best: caring for people and saving lives. Meghan court out The beauty of the justice system is that it is blind. Rich or poor, those before the courts are judged on the facts of their case and nothing more. Even Meghan Markle is finding this out now. She “forgot” certain vital information during a hearing. What’s frightening for her is that others might now remember things that were forgotten.

The dference is this one was hiding in plain sight. The Register of Members’ Interests is packed with facts and figures on MPs’ outside earnings and the identities of companies paying them.

It is only because Prime Minister Boris Johnson bungled an outrageous attempt to save the career of corrupt MP Owen Paterson that the spotlight is now shining on it.

But new Living Wage Foundation research published today shows that nearly five million employees in the UK – one in six workers – are paid less than the real Living Wage. The real Living Wage is the wage people need to be paid just to keep their heads above water. In other words, millions are working hard but still struggling to pay their rent and bills and feed their families. In every corner of the country, working people are feeling the pinch. Everyday costs - fuel, food and other essentials - are rising. All the while, wages are stagnant.  After eleven years of Tory Government, real wages have only just ed to their  value - that’s the worst period for wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. And despite the Chancellor’s triumphant tone at the Budget, background documents revealed later that the pay squeeze is set to continue for the next five years. So, as we mark national Living Wage week, let’s be clear that hard work should pay for everyone – no matter who you are or what kind of job you do. Despite big promises, this Conservative government has shown it isn’t serious about solving Britain’s wage woes. They have walloped ordinary working people with tax rises and cuts to universal credit in the middle of a cost-of-living crunch. To get Britain’s wages rising, here’s what needs to happen right now.  First, directly increase the pay of millions of workers by boosting the minimum wage to £ per hour now. Next spring’s rise to £. is welcome but will still be below the real Living Wage. Working people canapost wait. They need money in their wallets now. Second, clamp down on endemic low pay and insecure work by banning zero-hours contracts. Too many workers are subject to unpredictable hours that mean their earnings go up and down too. And third, make it easier for workers to get together in unions to bargain with their employers for better pay and conditions. Workers deserve better than having to live from pay slip to pay slip, week to week – not knowingthey will be able to afford the bills.It’s time for change.

Investcorp helped bankroll a firm which worked for the Chinese government on surveillance systems capable of tracking oppressed Uyghur Muslims. It is feared a million Uyghurs are held in “brainwashing” detention camps, that women have been sterilised and children taken away.  Articial intelligencecompany Sense Time said its technology could identy Uyghurs by facial recognition. Yet Mr Fuller, , sat on a parliamentary committee which examined treatment of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang – and recommended fines for UK firms using supply chains linked to the province.Mr Fuller – educated at Oxford and Hard – is MP for North East Bedfordshire. His earnings are within the rules, but the new details come as the Tories are mired in sleaze over extra income and Boris Johnson is under pressure to ban secondary jobs for his MPs. Last night Labour ’s deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “The corruption scandal that has engulfed the Conservative Party gets worse by the day.“We need an investigation to get to the bottom of whether this relationship has put our national ­security at risk and whether this technology has aided human rights abuses in China.”  MPs are paid £,.

Investcorp has pumped millions into technology firms in China.  In , it invested in the China Everbright Limited New Economy Fund. In  it started to jointly manage the fund, overseen by the Chinese government. A key beneficiary was Sense Time, which has done work for China’s powerful propaganda unit. In a  patent for a facial-recognition product, Sense Time stated: “It is possible to ide the ethnicities... according to Han, non-Han and unknown, or according to Han, Uyghur, non-Han, non-Uyghur, and unknown.” Investcorp also backed Terminus, an AI firm involved in fitting “surveillance cam-eras with image identication capability” in some Chinese cities. Last night a spokesman for Sense Time said its patent was “never designed” to “discriminate against any groups” and said it liaised with the UN and other international organisations. He added: “Such an action is a violation of our company values. The patent application was amended. We are committed to promoting the responsible and sustainable use of AI.” Alkan Akad, of Amnesty International, said: “There are grave human rights violations in China.

Kenda, from Michigan in the US, mentioned her son Darrin was a similar age to Ayse and that he wanted to chat to someone across the pond. “It’s funny that I met my mother-in-law before I met my husband,” Ayse said. “We got on so well, so when she suggested speaking to her son, I thought it was a great idea – although I was a bit nervous at first because I’d seen photos of him and he looked lovely.” When she was first put in touch with Darrin, the pair spoke frequently as friends - but it wasnapost long before their relationship developed into something more. “I told him about my hobbies, how old I was, where I was from, that sort of thing,” Ayse said. “I knew he was from the US so didn’t expect anything from it but thought it would still be interesting to chat to someone from somewhere .” Within weeks, they were calling each other every single night - despite the five hour time dference, meaning Ayse was often falling asleep at am UK time. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “It was during the pandemic so I wasn’t working as I’d been furloughed and just altered my sleep pattern, so I was sleeping at the same time Darrin was,” she said. “We’d be on video call and just be chatting when we fall asleep – then usually when I wake up, he’s still there sleeping. After they made their relationship official in November , Ayse started planning her trip to the US to meet her beau in the flesh for the first time. But the meet-up in July was put on hold by strict travel restrictions to the States. When she tried to fly to Michigan indirectly via Mexico, her plans were scuppered when she arrived in the US as she was turned away by immigration. “I think they thought thatthey let me into the US then I’d never leave because of Darrin,” Ayse said. It was so heart-breaking to be so close to him in the same city, but not be allowed through the border. I was put on the next flight home and cried the whole way back.  The pair managed as best as they could by having weekly aposdate nightsapos on video calls - ordering each other takeaway food and treats to their door. On  May , Darrin popped the question - and Ayse said yes. “When he answered the call he seemed so nervous which was unlike him – but I soon understood why when he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him,” she recalled. The couple knew it would be a while before they could meet in person, so they decided not to waste any time and tie the knot as soon as they could - over Zoom. On th August, the pair officially became husband and we over a video call ceremony officiated in the US state of Utah.  Joining them on the call were a few of their most cherished family and friends, who watched the pair say their vows. The married couple, who still havenapost met face to face, speak several times every day, hoping Ayseaposs visa application will soon be accepted so they can enjoy le together as husband and we. Ayse, a cleaner, from Lancaster, Lancs, said: “I never imagined this would happen to me in a million years. “I don’t think anyone expected this when we started talking last year. “But we’re married and it’s all completely legal and official – I still can’t believe it. “It’s been really hard not being able to meet properly, but in the long run it will make us stronger because we’ve had to go through all of this to be together. We just really love each other.” Looking back on their whirlwind relationship, Ayse is grateful both their families are supportive of their union. “I didn’t tell my parents straight away when we first started talking, but they twigged there was something going on when I was on the phone all the time,” Ayse said.  “They had reservations about it to start with – but I suggested they chat to Darrin on Skype and they saw straight away how crazy we both are about each other. She added Darrin had even spoken to her dad to ask for his permission before popping the question. “In our heads, as long as our family and friends are supportive, that’s all we need,” she said. She added the pair will celebrate together when they can, but for now, theyaposre happy with their perfect ceremony. “I still can’t believe it – I never expected any of this but you’ve got to take what le throws at you. “I miss Darrin every day but I know we’ll be together one day and it’ll all be worth it.”  Last week, travel restrictions in the US were finally lted - but Ayse will still have to wait a bit longer to see her beau while she waits for another visa to be approved. Darrin said it seems like a long time ago that they first became pen pals - and now theyaposre battling against the world together. As we haven’t met in person yet we haven’t been able to have a physical relationship, which means that our marriage is based off of more than that, he said. This hasn’t affected our relationship like it could do others, as it’s not something we see as the most important aspect, and we value other things, such as communication more.Are you in a relationship surviving against the odds  Send your love stories to jessica.taylor@reachplcIt’s not everyday you find your best friend and the love of your le in one, so I wasnapost going to let her get away simply because we live in dferent countries.

He said: “Loads of people now message me regularly asking for updates. I got an anonymous email from a man saying he had been flying a remote control plane over Gentleshaw Common at Cannock Chase who said he’d seen something unusual. With his description of the location, I went out there straight away, and found the footprint. “I was astounded… I’d never seen a footprint that large in my le, and it was clearly not made using a mould or cast “That is probably the moment I realised the Cannock Chase Bigfoot was more than just a myth.” A month later, Lee found the claw marks on a tree near a mutilated deer. He said: “It looked as though something had bitten and then ripped out its throat before eating from the torso.  “You see a lot of dead deer on Cannock Chase – often they’ve been hit by cars – but it was unusual to see one in that condition.” Lee claims he caught a glimpse of Bigfoot once while researching for his book. He said: “I can’t say for sure what it was, as it was around  pm and getting dark and the figure was covered in shadow. “It definitely moved more like an animal than a man, and it was easily seven feet tall. “I tried to run after it, but it was too quick and disappeared into a dense section of trees.” Lee has been fascinated with Bigfoot ever since he was a child.  He said: “I remember watching Bigfoot documentaries with my dad when I was young. “All the famous sightings were in America, so when I was a bit older I started researching any UK sightings I could find. “I just kept going from there and here I am.” Lee has published multiple books on supernatural occurrences in Cannock Chase, including his most recent book on Bigfoot. Lee said: “There have actually been many sightings since as far back as the s of man-monkey type creatures in Staffordshire. “Reports of these sightings seem to have drastically increased in number and frequency since the beginning of . “I think people like to keep an open mind about these things. “Especially after they have read the reports and seen the evidence for themselves.” Comment MORE ON Bigfoot\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But Kayleigh, who works in network marketing, was left with loose skin following the gastric bypass so she decided to have a tummy tuck, breast lt and implants earlier this year in October . Now, Kayleigh, from Clacton, Essex, gleams with pride as she shows off her size ten physique. She said: I have always been chubby but began to struggle with my weight after giving birth to Morgan, now seven. I was constantly yo-yo dieting, I would lose three stone and then gain it back plus more. Then it became even harder to lose weight after giving birth to Harley, four. I was stuck in a rut and barely ever cooked. It was much easier to eat takeaways - I would spend around £ per week on food. I would buy £ worth of junk from the supermarket, £ on a Chinese takeaway, £ on pizza, £ on an Indian, £ on KFC and £ on McDonaldaposs.  A typical from a Chinese takeaway would be large rice, chow mien, chicken balls, salt and pepper chicken, sweet and sour chicken. Itaposs disgusting when I think about it.

Morgan has commented on how much happier and involved I am which was incredible to hear. I saved for the surgery and it has definitely paid off already. I feel amazing.

Youngsters Ellie, , and Lauren, , pointed out the strange fish to their sea-obsessed father Ziggy Austin on Maidencombe beach in Torquay. This is the latest in a series of findings after three of the fish were reported on the Isles of Scilly, one in Newquay and one in Kimmeridge, Dorset over a three-week period in March and April. Normally no more than two of the fish are recorded to wash up on the coast every year.  The fish, which rarely comes close to the surface from its normally -meter deep habitat, could potentially have been killed by oceanic microplastics - a consequence of water pollution. Subsisting on a diet of worms, prawns and shrimp, the fish consumes creatures well recorded to themselves eat large amounts of microplastics through plankton which then build up in the creature until it dies. Previous studies into sprat and boar fish fish samples have suggested that there is an aposabundanceapos of the tiny plastics ingested by the creatures. Ziggy Austin, , who has run Rock Solid Coasteering in Devon for seven years, said it was a aposrare findapos.He said: It was fresh, it had literally just died, and the weather has been very calm, so it wasnapost pushed here. It must have swum here, but they usually swim in large shoals from the deep ocean.I read online that only two wash up a year, so itaposs pretty rare. I know every single species of fish thataposs out there pretty much, and this was something Iaposd never seen before. So the shoes and socks were straight off and I was straight in there - no hesitation, I had to get my hands on it. It looked like a goldfish with a giant eye. It was only just in the first stage of rigor mortis, so it must have died in the last half an hour.

All of their personalities are out of this world, that I just keep going out and buying them. I dread to think how much Iaposve spent on them, but I canapost help it. Iaposd hateanything ever happened to them and sometimes worry about dog theft.  Iaposd rather they steal my husband! As well as her  Miniature Dachshunds, Chanel, four Darla, four Niko, four Luna, three Scotty, two Donna, two Scarlett, two Forest, one Lemmy,  months Echo, nine months Lando, eight months and Coal, six months - Claire also has Princess the Dalmatian, , two horses and chickens. Speaking about the dogsapos designer gear, she said: Their wardrobe is double the size of mine,not bigger. Iaposve spent hundreds,not thousands on their clothes. Theyaposve all got shoes, raincoats, hats and warm jackets which can be quite practical in the cold months. Donna has sun glasses to protect her eyes and Princess has her own knickers. They all love to be dolled up. They are all fed on a raw food diet. They have everything from chicken feet and rabbit ears to fruits, vegetables such as celery, and lots of tablets and vitamins.  Sometimes they get a sweet treat too which they love. I try to budget at £ a week for all of their food, and bulk buy a lot of it. They eat better than we do! The  Dachshunds also have a free roam of the house and Claireaposs spacious back garden. Claire added: I never take them out on walks outside of the house, as I feel people will think Iaposm a bit crazy. Theyaposre all my little children, and theyaposre absolutely perfect. Itaposs like having a full-time job caring for them all, they love to demand attention but theyaposre worth it.

John Charles and Laura Waddingham told how they had major issues with their home during the autumn and winter months due to a lack of insulation and a bitter draught blowing through. The pair said it had left them struggling with their own health and forced to keep their children - aged between eight and  - off school as they had woken up being sick.The family, who moved into the house in April , got in touch with BirminghamLive after claiming to have contacted Birmingham City Council dozens of times and explained they didnapost know what  to do. John and Laura, who live near the border of Birmingham and Solihull, claimed that on one occasion near the start of their tenancy the family had slept in the front room together to try and keep warm. They have since swapped bedrooms so the children are warmer at night - but said their two daughters were still sleeping together for heat rather than on their bunk beds. When we first moved in this house was absolutely freezing, Laura said. We didnapost have any gas the first day we moved in because the appointment had been made for the next day for the gas to be switched on. When the gas was put on, we left the heating on all day and the house was still the same.  It hasnapost warmed up since, itaposs just getting colder in here. Laura, who works as a carer for John who has hearing loss and learning disabilities, said she felt it was affecting them both physically and mentally. I feel lightheaded when Iaposm walking, Laura said. But itaposs only when I walk far that Iaposll get that feeling. And itaposs because of living here. I didnapost have it before. And John said his mental health had taken a hit as he described it as like living in a shed.  When I was sleeping in the bedroom I was suffering that bad I wanted to cry like a baby, he said. I went up and down the stairs to try and sleep downstairs on my own, I couldnapost get to sleep. I didnapost know what to do. The pair said the kids were always complaining they were cold and had been off school because they were ill in the morning. It affects the way they sleep as well, Laura added. They can go to sleep and then they will wake up all of a sudden because theyaposre cold. And family visits and sleepovers are impossible as their living conditions mean they cannot have people around.  John and Laura, who have been together for  years, said they didnapost want to move from the area due to the childrenaposs school but were hoping the council would sort their problems out. They claimed the local authority had attempted to blame them for the damp and mould due to DIY work. Weaposre just hoping that they can sort this problem out because they are the landlord. Laura added. I have been contacting them to help us but they are trying to blame us. John added: Itaposs just a nightmare the way it has changed our lestyles around.  We go out most of the time down to the Wacky [Warehouse] or down to the local pub and have a family dinner because it is affecting us. All we want is for them to sort this house out. I donapost want to move. The school is close and I canapost walk far. I just want them to fix the problem. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: Our contractor painted the property in October and on another visit in November tried to carry out repairs and do a damp survey but was not granted access.No damp was picked up when painting the property but clearly with the change in weather there has been damp incursion.We are sorry for the impact that this has had on the tenants. We are working with them to resolve it and will ensure that it is treated as soon as possible.

They said Mr Perry noticed some kind of light attached to his clothing and the man was messing around with it which is when he jumped out of his car and locked the passenger in the back of the vehicle. They said: As soon as he did, itaposs gone off. Davidaposs the luckiest man in Britain as well as the most heroic,this guy got in the hospital God knows what could have happened.

Among those paying tribute to the hero cab driver was Billy Darwin.He posted on Facebook : “David nearly paid the ultimate price to save others apparently not giving anything a second thought besides making sure he went above and beyond to keep the people of Our City safe!”Kev Cuthbertson posted: “He is a hero, when he noticed the bomb, he locked the scumbag in the car. But took the brunt of the blast.”  Stephen Thomas wrote: “The driver is my mate, and spotted the passenger acting suspiciously, so he jumped out the car.” Another, George Cater, wrote: Please send your healing prayers to David Perry, the very brave taxi driver who is in a critical condition in hospital after preventing an attack at am this morning at Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital. David stopped by the women’s hospital and locked the attacker in his cab after noticing the device.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it appears the taxi driver caught up in the Liverpool explosion acted with “incredible presence of mind and bravery”. He also tweeted on Sunday: My thoughts are with all those affected by the awful incident in Liverpool today.I want to thank the emergency services for their quick response and professionalism, and the police for their ongoing work on the investigation.  Earlier, a spokesman for Merseyside Police said: So far we understand that the car involved was a taxi which pulled up at the hospital shortly before the explosion occurred. We are keeping an open mind as to what caused the explosion, but given how it has happened - out of caution - counter terrorism police are leading the investigation supported by Merseyside Police. The Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, Serena Kennedy, has offered her reassurance over the incident.  She said: While I understand that todayaposs incident may cause concern in our communities, it should be pointed out that events of this nature are very rare. Merseyside Police will continue to liaise with community groups, community leaders, partner agencies and iniduals in the coming days and weeks to make sure any concerns are addressed and ensuring that we provide the best possible service to local people.  There will also be an increased and visible police presence on the streets of Merseyside and I would encourage people to engage with my officers and raise any concerns they may have. Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital said visiting access had been restricted until further notice and patients had been erted to other hospitals where possible.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Merseyside PoliceTerrorismTerror attacks\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Retired barmaid Betty Walsh, , was said to have been set upon as she went to get her supper at Best Kebab and Fish Bar in Brentford, west London, around pm Friday night. A family friend, -year-old Ali Abucar Ali, who recently won a scholarship to play basketball, was fatally stabbed as he intervened. Betty’s eldest daughter Bridget, , said her mum didn’t realise she had been attacked until Ali stepped in to help. She added: “Ali went up and asked what all the commotion was about, challenged her attacker and tried to help her. What happened to him next was a tragedy. “I knew him and his mother. They are a very good family. His mother had rushed to comfort me as soon as she heard what happened to Mum, before the police phoned her and told her the devastating news that her son had so sadly been stabbed.  “Ali was a really hardworking, good lad who had recently won a scholarship to play basketball.” Bridget said her mum will remain in St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington for a number of weeks after undergoing emergency surgery. She added: ‘’She will come out eventually, but it could be a few weeks or a month.  “We are devastated that we weren’t able to see her yesterday, but my sister has since been allowed to see her.” Her family said the pensioner is no longer on the ‘critical’ list after undergoing a kidney operation following the incident. Mum of six Betty also has  grandchildren,  great grandchildren and a great great granddaughter. A fundraiser set up in memory of Ali’s devastated family had yesterday topped £,. Brentford residents today praised Ali’s bravery in rushing to help Betty.  Laura Williams, , said: ‘’I never knew Ali, but from what I understandhe had not rushed to help poor Betty she probably would have lost her le with immediate effect. “He stopped in a dficult situation and performed a selfless act for which he paid the ultimate price. “I really have no words that can describe how his poor family are feeling. ‘’They deserve every penny raised from the GoFundMe page they have set up. I hope it can form a lasting legacy for him. ‘’They raised a good person who put himself on the line for someone  and tried to come to their rescue. ‘’Brentford has lost a very decent human being. He is a hero,  per cent.’’The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

What happened is just so sad, the old woman must be traumatised.’’ Deidrie Smith, , said: ‘’He was not thinking of himself when he rushed to help Betty. “He gave his le up but couldn’t have expected something so awful to happen to him.’’ Norris Henry, , from Brentford, was charged today with murder and attempted murder.

On Saturday night she attended the Royal British Legionaposs annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall before watching the National Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph in Central London yesterday morning. And at both events, Kate paid a subtle tribute to her late mother-in-law Princess Diana by wearing some of her jewellery.

Kate has sported them several times before, including at the commemorations for the centenary of the Battle of Passchendaele during the First World War in .

It came as she took centre stage as she watched the Remembrance Sunday service alongside the Duchess of Cornwall and Sophie Wessex.Kate looked solemn as she stood in the middle with Camilla and Sophie at her sides on a balcony of the Foreign Office while Prince Charles, Prince William, Princess Anne and Prince Edward were below as they laid wreaths at the Cenotaph.However, missing from the balcony was the Queen, who had sprained her back and was unable to attend todayaposs Remembrance Sunday service. In previous years, the Queen had stood on the balcony at the centre of Kate and Camilla. Buckingham Palace had said Her Majesty was disappointed to miss the event held annually at the Cenotaph on Whitehall. She was set to lead the nation in commemorating the war dead during her first in-person public engagement since going into hospital. The palace insisted her back strain was not connected to the recent hospital stay where she was forced to spend the night at the King Edward VII in Marylebone last month to undergo “preliminary investigations” for an unknown condition. A royal source said: “It is the most unfortunate timing for Her Majesty who recently had a short break to Sandringham in Norfolk for a few days and was left feeling rested and recuperated on herto Windsor Castle. “On conversation with royal doctors it was decided that a back sprain is not conducive with a car journey and a period of standing. “Her Majesty is deeply disappointed to miss the ceremony.” The Queen had only ever missed six Remembrance Sunday events in her -year reign before yesterday - four due to being abroad on royal tours and two when she was pregnant.Comment MORE ON Remembrance DayKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrincess DianaRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In previous years, the Queen had stood on the balcony at the centre of Kate and Camilla. All three women, Kate, Camilla and Sophie, were dressed in black hats and coats that had poppies pinned to them. Kateaposs Alexander McQueen coat was one she had previously worn to the same event in . It came as Charles looked emotional and almost teary-eyed as he led the nation in paying tribute to its war dead. He looked sombre as he observed the two-minute silence before laying a wreath on behalf of the Queen and one for himself. He was followed by Prince William, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, who also placed wreaths at the Cenotaph.Earlier today, Buckingham Palace said Her Majesty was disappointed to miss the event held annually at the Cenotaph in London.  She was set to lead the nation in commemorating the war dead during her first in-person public engagement since going into hospital. Buckingham Palace insisted her back strain was not connected to the recent hospital stay where she was forced to spend the night at the King Edward VII in Marylebone last month to undergo “preliminary investigations” for an unknown condition.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

A royal source said: “It is the most unfortunate timing for Her Majesty who recently had a short break to Sandringham in Norfolk for a few days and was left feeling rested and recuperated on herto Windsor Castle. “On conversation with royal doctors it was decided that a back sprain is not conducive with a car journey and a period of standing. “Her Majesty is deeply disappointed to miss the ceremony.” The Queen has only ever missed six Remembrance Sunday events in her -year reign before today - four due to being abroad on royal tours and two when she was pregnant.  In a statement, the Palace said it was with great regret the Queen would be unable to attend the service. The statement said: The Queen, having sprained her back, has decided this morning with great regret that she will not be able to attend todayaposs Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. Her Majesty is disappointed that she will miss the service. As in previous years, a wreath will be laid on Her Majestyaposs behalf by The Prince of Wales. His Royal Highness, along with the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra will be present at the Cenotaph today as planned.

There are many unanswered questions at this stage, but the cell clearly had some bomb-making skills and a radicalised suicide bomber. These factors suggest some expertise that may have been picked up from terrorist activity abroad, possibly with ISIS or even al-Qaeda. Targeting a hospital matches some terrorist tactics used overseas, in Kabul, for example. However, given the timing of this attack, it is more likely that this extremist was seeking to detonate at the nearby Remembrance Day service. Given the speed of arrests, within hours of the attack, it is likely that this cell was known to the police.Extremists ing from terrorist activity abroad are often on police and security service watch lists, but with a lack of evidence available to prosecute them, it is dficult to keep them out of our communities.

Both Noah now , and Jacob now , were born on December  - on Sophieaposs th and st birthday. The family from Southend, Essex, now enjoy joint celebrations with three birthdays and Christmas all in the same month. The -year-old mum of two said: We certainly didnapost plan it like this, in fact it wasnapost very well planned at all. Neither of her two boys were due on her birthday, with Noah arriving  days late in  and Jacob arriving  days early in .

Smiling she added: We had a double celebration that day and both Michael and my mum made sure I still had a birthday card amongst all the new baby gts and messages.  A year later, we had a birthday party for Noah turning one. Celebrating your own birthday as you get older or once you have kids isnapost such a big deal. We try and go out the weekend before, but I donapost mind. In , Sophie and Michael found out they were expecting a second boy and the midwe joked he might also share the same date. Sophie said: It didnapost enter my head that Jacob would come on my birthday, I was more concerned about Christmas day as his due date was th December. My birthday was  days before his due date, so I wasnapost worried - until the first week of December. We were in the middle of moving house with a  year old, Christmas around the corner and suddenly I felt dferent and I just knew Jacob was going to be early. Sophie woke up at am on her birthday as her waters broke and at .pm, her second son arrived.

It was also Noahaposs th birthday - and he wasnapost thrilled to share his special day. Sophie said: He was at school and my mum picked him up and he didnapost understand that his baby brother was coming, he just wanted his parents and presents. My mum got him a cake and her gts but he said it was a rubbish birthday - I later told him labour wasnapost my idea of a fun birthday either. He did fall in love with Jacob when he met him and they get on great. In fact Mum Sophie has never celebrated her birthday on her own. She said: Even in school, I shared my birthday with my best friend. We had joint parties and as we grew up, we would celebrate together.

Despite her claims she was charged with causing Mrs Ingramaposs death by careless or inconsiderate driving in the aftermath of the accident in July , Teeside Live reports.The -year-old dog breeder and equestrian worker faced a jail term of up to five yearsshe was convicted by a jury at Teesside Crown Court. The case was due to be heard on Monday but prosecutors announced they wonapost pursue the charge against her.

She was placed under investigation after the fatal crash involving her grey Seat Leon, an Audi Q and Mrs Ingramaposs vehicle on the A near Kirklevington, Yarm, on July  .Mrs Ingram, , a retired carer from Stockton, had been a passenger in the Nissan and died several days after the accident from chest and abdominal injuries.Two children in the Audi, aged seven and , both suffered minor whiplash, while Mrs Shaw herself suffered a broken foot and whiplash. Mrs Shaw first appeared at Teesside Magistratesapos Court in November, last year, where she denied the offence, sobbing through the short hearing and dabbing her eyes with a tissue.She was told by the chairman of the bench: This is so serious it cannot be heard at the Magistratesapos Court, therefore the trial will be at the Crown Court and your first hearing at the Crown Court will be on the th of January at  oaposclock Until that time you are going to be released on unconditional bail. Mrs Shaw said at that time that she had been hit with more than £, in legal fees and described the surreal experience of finding herself in the dock at a criminal court for the first time.At her home in Yarm she said: I really donapost know why the case had to go to court, I provided evidence straight away that Iaposd been stung by a wasp.There was a picture on my phone and my hospital records which showed Iaposd been given antihistamine for the sting.To find myself in a criminal court facing a potential jail sentence was surreal but very frightening. Of course I looked up the maximum sentence for the crime I was charged with and discovered it was five years in prison.So much goes through your mind. What will happen to me and to my kidsI go to jail  Itaposs been the worst time of my le.I feel very relieved that the case is over, it hasnapost quite sunk in yet.But at the same time there really is no good outcome from this because that other family have lost a whole person from their lives.I canapost say how sorry I am for what happened, itaposs something Iaposll carry around with me for the rest of my le. Mrs Shaw, whose husband works as a welder, was ing home with her daughter and her daughteraposs friend when the accident happened.She said: I was aware of a pain at the back of my leg at the top of my calf and looked down to see a wasp crawling up my leg.It took a matter of seconds but when I looked up the other car was right in front of my and I hit the brakes but couldnapost stop.I broke my ankle in what Iaposve been told is a typical injury from braking. It was devastating to be told the lady in the other car had died.It affected me very badly and I lived with that for over a year until in October last year the police rang me and said they had investigated and were about to bring charges. She continued: It came so out of the blue that I couldnapost comprehend it at first. I must have cried for weeks, it was horrendous.Attending a criminal court for the first time was awful, sitting in the dock with my bag, feeling like a criminal.It cost thousands in legal fees because I didnapost apply for Legal Aid, assuming I wouldnapost qualy.My dad, who worked hard all his le at ICI, paid my legal fees and it came to more than £,. Iaposm so grateful to him for that but it should never have been necessary.I have no idea how a case can be taken through the courts for a year before the Crown Prosecution Service decides thereaposs no case to answer.They had the evidence from the start. I was stung by a wasp and the accident happened because of that, but my family and I have still been through all of this. My main thought is still with the family of the lady who died.

Charlotte Phillips said the ambulance and paramedics got to her daughter, Amelia, within three minutes of the call to  on Tuesday  November. The alarm was raised when her daughter took a turn in nursery, and soon went into a daze and all but stopped breathing.The -year-old said the incredible paramedics helped the family come back around from what was described a “traumatic” experience for them, Plymouth Live reports. Charlotte and Ameliaaposs experience comes as the NHS is under intense pressure because of ambulance wait times, due to handover delays at hospitals. Ameliaaposs experience comes as a diabetic man, , was forced to wait nearly  hours for ambulance after fall in his kitchen in Staffordshire last Monday.Cyril Pepper was left with severe back pain and damage to his arm after banging his head falling at his home. Cyrilaposs situation is sadly not unique, but the paramedics were able to get to Charlotteaposs daughter because they were not far away when she called. She was suffering from anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially le threatening allergic reaction that can happen in a matter of seconds or hours when exposed to something the sufferer is allergic to. In Ameliaaposs case she is allergic to milk, butter cheese and cream. Amelia went into her first anaphylactic shock when she was just eighteen months old, where Charlotte had to use an EpiPen to save her le. Charlotte said other times she has come into contact with something she is allergic to, she has come up in a rash. Charlotte received a phone call from her nursery to tell her that Amelia was not herself, so they collected her and took her home. Charlotte told PlymouthLive: “I had a phone call from her nursery saying that she went really quiet, a bit dazed and glazy eyed and lucky enough my mum was home to pick her up. “She was then trying to talk to me but her breathing was quite shallow and disrupted, so I tried to talk to her and then realised somethingaposs not right here, so I ran downstairs to grab her EpiPen.“I jabbed her with the pen then called  and I know the NHS is under so much pressure, which is such a shame, but luckily enough within three and a half minutes they were with us and got her into recovery position.” Charlotte said it was her second time using an EpiPen on Tuesday and she did not realise fully what was going on, and did not know all of the signs to look out for with her daughter, so when she did use it, she said it was too late. She said that minutes before the paramedics arrived she watched her daughter all but stop breathing and go a grey colour that was an emotional experience. Not long after the paramedics arrived to open her airways and give her another shot of an EpiPen to help ease off Ameliaaposs anaphylactic shock. Charlotte said: “They were just absolutely fantastic, they stayed here and made sure she was stable, watched her from the EpiPen being used. They reassured us and thanked me really for doing everything that I could have in that situation. “They were just amazing. When they left they, left us feeling quite confident knowing what we had to do and what to look out for.” Although Charlotte said she felt awful for calling the paramedics after seeing the pressure on the NHS in the media, they reassured her to always call them whenever she uses a EpiPen on her daughter.

Shes worked with some of the most famous killers in our country, such as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutclfe, Moors Murderer Ian Brady and necrophile Dennis NilsenKerry Daynes has been a forensic psychologist for  yearsByKirsten JonesFeatures  Lestyle Writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsWolfing down my chicken kebab supper, I look around the table and idly wonder what most folk would make of my fellow diners – a collection of ex-murderers, sex offenders and arsonists. But I’m not frightened. It’s  and part of my job is spending time in this “halfway house” in a busy northern city. Imy empty plate to Nigel, a shy man who’s washing up. Suddenly, I feel a blow to my stomach. Nigel has stabbed me with a in kebab skewer. He looks panicked, eyes flicking from side to side. I remain calm, staggering to the staff office while blood seeps through my white blouse. “Call an ambulance!” I gasp, slumping to the ground. I’ve been a forensic psychologist for  years, working with some of the most famous killers in our country, such as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutclfe, Moors Murderer Ian Brady and necrophile Dennis Nilsen.  I use science and psychology to try and analyse people who commit crimes – from shoplting to shocking murders – and determinethey’re safe to be released from prison.I’ve always had a fascination with the macabre. As a child I read horror stories about killer grannies and watched Doctor Who from behind the sofa – monsters were about the only things that scared me. This career was my calling.I remember the first time I walked into a prison. It was Strangeways – now called HMP Manchester. I was a naive -year-old, keen to learn about crime psychology. It sounds cheesy, but I wanted to create a world with fewer victims in it. On my tour, the inmates started catcalling, “There’s some p***y on the wing!” The prison officer rolled his eyes at my confusion. He knew I’d be eaten alive. Two years later, in , I volunteered as a psychology assistant at Wakefield prison, nicknamed Monster Mansion by insiders. It’s full of sex offenders and murderers I’d only seen in the newspapers. I was feet away from parent killer Jeremy Bamber, Colin “Gay Slayer” Ireland and child murderer Terence McCready. It was utterly surreal yet I was so excited. This was long before the #MeToo movement and the male prison officers gave me a hard time. One day I interviewed a man who raped, strangled and murdered a woman. While we talked in the cell, the officers locked me in for a laugh.  When I tugged at the door, it wouldn’t budge. Then it hit me… I was stuck in a room with a killer. I tried not to look frightened but I’m a redhead, I must have flushed like a tomato. He looked at me with a creepy smile. I was intimidated and genuinely scared – and he loved it. He said to me, “You’ve got a pretty neck, you know. It looks a lot like my victim’s.” I was only locked in for  minutes, but it felt like forever. Another inmate called out, “Are you alright in there, Miss ” adding, “I hope you’re treating her well.” That was his way of telling the inmate I was locked in with, “I’ll deal with youyou don’t.” I shook like a leaf that afternoon, but it didn’t put me off. Nowadays, I’m desensitised to a lot of things others would find completely paralysing. You’re probably used to seeing grey-haired men commenting on crimes on TV, but most forensic psychologists are women. People still think I chop up dead bodies for a living – that’s not my job. Nor am I running around the country trampling over crime scenes in my high heels and single-handedly arresting serial killers, like they do in TV dramas. Not all of my clients are dangerous, either. In  I worked with a -year-old named Frank Ecclestone, who confessed to a gruesome assault with a baseball bat. It was a messy case and the victim had almost died. Frank was regarded in the community as “a bit strange”. When I interviewed him, he was wearing a T-shirt featuring John Wayne Gacy – the “Killer Clown” who murdered at least  young men and boys. Not only did this quiet young man confess to the assault, he also blurted out that he was a serial killer and began headbutting the hospital wall.Afterwards, we were intercepted by another patient who had slit her wrist. My arm turned red as I gripped her wound to stem the flow. Meanwhile, Frank had gone a terrible shade of green. I knew he wasn’t a serial killer. Nor hadhe assaulted the victim. He was clearly scared of blood.Frank had given a  confession. It turned out that he had been raped by his stepmother as a child, and his little sister Holly was actually his daughter. His father threatened him and Frank confessed, “If I could say I was a killer he [Dad] would be scared to fight me.” To Frank, killers were powerful people who commanded attention and respect. Indeed, serial killers have become almost like pop-culture celebrities. I’ve been contacted by women who have US killer Ted Bundy’s teeth marks tattooed on their bodies – they think he was sexy! One day I was sitting on the sofa at home watching telly when the phone rang. I put the phone to my ear and heard a faint Scottish burr: “Hello Kerry, this is Dennis Nilsen.”  I thought it was a wind-up, but it really was him. Dennis talked to me in graphic detail about his offences, keeping his fantasy alive. He spoke bitterly about his childhood in a Scottish fishing village, where he was bullied and was dishonest about his sexuality. He blamed a great deal of his dissatisfaction in le on his mother. Over four years he phoned me  more times. They were long, rambling telephone calls. Dennis loved to talk about himself and I wanted to understand his distorted version of the events that occurred at Melrose Avenue and Cranley Gardens in London. He’d revel in the TV shows about him. Receiving telephone calls and text messages from offenders and victims is common – you wouldn’t believe how many I’ve had. So Dennis’s chats weren’t that surprising. I now have Callon my phone, because I never know who’s going to ring me. A few years ago, I really felt fear. I was on TV talking about Jeremy Bamber. Jeremy doesn’t like me – he claims I wrote  stories about him and that I was never a qualied psychologist, which is nonsense. Anyway, someone who was watching became my stalker. This man set up websites in my name, claiming to be a fan of mine – I’m a forensic psychologist, not Britney Spears! He wanted photographs and information about me and when I politely declined, he got angry and wrote awful things about me. He said I was the criminal, he knew the size of my breasts and described what I was wearing each day. He was physically watching me and I was terried. One day I found the words “Jill Dando” written on my fence and, behind it, the leless body of my cat. I was devastated by the death of my poor pet.  I took the man to court myself and paid thousands to have the awful websites removed. Only then was he arrested and given a harassment warning. It was  and I felt more afraid at home alone than I ever did in a prison full of killers. I’m a single woman, so there’s no man to worry about me. And I didn’t tell my parents or sister about being stabbed with that kebab skewer – I didn’t want them to fret. But now, after  years in the business, I could tell my family anything and they’d take it in their stride.It’s only when I talk about my job that I realise how surreal it sounds, but after work I come home, do the washing up and watch Strictly like everyone .In the past I’ve spent a lot of time in therapy to stop me remembering crime scene photographs or the horrors that I’ve heard. But I’m not scared of anyone I’ve worked with – I find politicians far more frightening than murderers. I’ve met people who’ve done dreadful, unforgivable things, but I don’t believe they are evil. It’s my job to find those human drivers behind inhuman behaviour. Every person has a story.

He said she was absolutely right to pull out of the service as it would have entailed standing for more hours, putting further pressure on her back. Dr Shah said it remains to be seen whether the back sprain is just a one-off orit turns into a long-term condition that comes and goes. Explaining how Her Majesty will probably use anti-inflammatory creams and painkillers to calm the pain, he said: aposIt is important to have a proper strategy in mind for her recovery. The Queenaposs attendance at the service had been confirmed by the palace on Thursday after she was ordered to rest by royal doctors just over three weeks ago and spent a night in hospital on October  undergoing preliminary tests. The monarch was due to watch the service from the balcony of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office building. The Queen has only ever missed six Remembrance Sunday events in her  year reign - four due to being abroad on royal tours and two when she was pregnant. Buckingham Palaceaposs statement on Sunday read: The Queen, having sprained her back, has decided this morning with great regret that she will not be able to attend todayaposs Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph. Her Majesty is disappointed that she will miss the service. As in previous years, a wreath will be laid on Her Majestyaposs behalf by The Prince of Wales. His Royal Highness, along with the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester, the Duke of Kent and Princess Alexandra will be present at the Cenotaph today as planned.

Just  minutes before, royal aides had announced that the Queen had “with great regret” not been able to join the event due to a back strain. In a reign of almost  years it was only the seventh time she had not attended and just the first due to illness. Palace aides hurried to allay fears that Her Majesty’s condition was not more serious, but many will be worried, given the unwillingness of Buckingham Palace to keep the nation informed when the Queen was in hospital last month. For now, we are told she has been told to rest up at Windsor and will be up to doing light duties as she recovers. Anyone who has suffered a bad back will know how awfully debilitating it can be.  No one would be more upset by yesterday’s turn of events than the Queen.

Mr Zahawi’s total earnings from Gulf Keystone Petroleum included a final £, “settlement payment” after he first became a Government minister in . Mr Zahawi was co-chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Kurdistan in  when he landed the job with Gulf Keystone, which has an oil field in Kurdistan and which paid him more than £, an hour. His Gulf Keystone income was declared in his register of interests, but his total second job earnings are not known thanks to Parliamentary rules allowing him to advise companies through Zahawi  Zahawi Ltd, a consultancy he set up with his we. Mr Zahawi did not respond to a request for comment. But Sir Alistair Graham, a former Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Le, said: “This could be interpreted as a deliberate attempt to get around the rules so that he doesn’t have to admit the scale of his earnings in a consultant capacity.  “The important thing to stress is that MPs have their personal responsibility to ensure that they comply not only with the letter but the spirit of the code of conduct. “Constituents have a right to know how much time and money he is taking separate to his political work.” Alex Runswick, of Transparency International UK, said: “Any new controls on MPs’ second jobs need to focus on potential conflicts of ­interests, not just the hours worked or additional earnings. “Any company owned by an MP risks becoming a shell behind which the extent of the work and these conflicts remain hidden.” Our probe comes after the outcries over Owen Paterson’s lobbying, and Sir Geoffrey Cox’s taxpayer-funded rental home and £million-a-year legal work.  The Mirror’s investigation has revealed how Mr Zahawi made a fortune in the murky world of business and politics in Kurdistan. Within months of becoming an MP in , Mr Zahawi became the vice-chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Kurdistan, taking five free trips to the region from  to . The secretariat to the group was funded by Gulf Keystone, the operator of the Shaikan oil field in the ­Kurdistan region of Iraq. Mr Zahawi was a guest speaker at a conference sponsored by Gulf Keystone and a second oil firm, Afren, in the Kurdistan capital Erbil in November . The two firms soon had Zahawi  Zahawi Ltd on the payroll.  Mr Zahawi’s father Hareth Zahawi’s firm Iraqi Project and Building ­Development was already involved in construction projects in Kurdistan. One source told the Mirror IPBD also had a monthly contract with Afren. The Mirror has found an archived page from the IPBD website which stated it had a joint venture with Sirwan Barzani, the nephew of Masoud Barzani, who was President of Kurdistan from  to . Sirwan Barzani has been accused in US court documents of corruption at his Iraqi telecoms company, but denies the “baseless” claims. Nadhim Zahawi’s register of interests shows Zahawi  Zahawi Ltd advised IPBD from  to . It is not known how much the role paid and there is no suggestion Mr Zahawi or his father knew of any corruption.

There is no suggestion Mr Zahawi was invloved in wrongdoing. When he stopped advising Afren in  he became Chief Strategy Officer at Gulf Keystone, initially earning £, and later £, for eight to  hours a month, which he declared. Just weeks after taking the appointment, the Kurdish oil ministry agreed to begin huge payments to Gulf Keystone as part of an existing oil deal. High Court papers reported by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project allege that Gulf Keystone secured the oil field, prior to Mr Zahawi’s involvement, through a corrupt deal with Kurdish politicians. The claims are denied.Mr Zahawi went on to receive almost £, in “bonus payments” from Gulf Keystone before he left in December . He was then paid an additional £, for “salary in lieu of notice” along with a £, “settlement payment”. This last payment was made in May , four months after he was appointed a junior minister at the Department for Education by then-Prime Minister Theresa May.

Tareena Shakil, , was jailed in the UK in  after taking her toddler son to Syria and joining the terror group. She was released two years later and now insists she no longer poses a threat to Britain. A judge said Shakil travelled to war-torn Syria “to produce the next generation of fighters”. She said: “It’s not something I’m happy about looking back.” The former school prefect claims she was deradicalised by the East London-based Active Change Foundation.She was filmed during the process for an ITV programme last night and said she wishes she could turn back the clock. Shakil secretly went to Raqqa after telling her family she was going on a short break. She said: “If I could go back I would have come back, I would have gone to Turkey on holiday. “Being aware of horric things happening in that place and still deciding to run away, not just on your own, with your child… I understand that is hard for people to understand. “And to just say you didn’t pay that much attention to it, but that’s what it was, I just... I didn’t. It’s easy for everybody to say, ‘She did this, she did that.’ “But you really have no idea what I was living through.”  Shakil, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffs, was jailed for six years at Birmingham crown court. The Spice Girls fan was also found guilty of encouraging terrorism on social media. Asked what she thinks about ISIS bride Shamima Begum, who has lost her British citizenship and is in a Syrian camp, Shakil said: “I can’t sit here and say, ‘No, don’t bring them back’. “Because that makes me a hypocrite because I’ve been in a very similar situation. “It’s not the same because I escaped.

Dontae Sharpe was granted a full pardon by North Caroline Governor Roy Copper, on Friday after decades fighting for his freedom.Sharpe, an African American, was just -years-old when he was sentenced in  for murdering George Radclfe, , during a drug deal.He was convicted based on the evidence given by Charlene Johnson, who was then -year-old and claimed to have seen Sharpe kill Radclfe and described it in detail. However, Johnson recanted her testimony two weeks later and after decades of trying to get his sentence overturned, two evidential hearings in  destroyed the case against Sharpe.  Not only had Johnson withdraw her initial testimony,tried again she would testy that she was not present at the time of the shooting and that her trial testimony was entirely made up based on what she saw on television and what investigators told her. In addition to that, the medical examiner of the trial, Dr Mary Gilliand only learned of Johnsonaposs  testimony well after the trial was over andcalled to a retrial would testy that Johnsonaposs initial description of the shooting was medically and scientically impossible. Sharpe is now eligible to apply for compensation of up to ,after losing decades of his le, , for each year of wrongful imprisonment. Speaking about the case, Cooper said: I have carefully reviewed Dontae Sharpeaposs case and am granting him a Pardon of Innocence. Mr Sharpe and others who have been wrongly convicted deserve to have that injustice fully and publicly acknowledged.

I was believing for a pardon. My familyaposs name has been cleared. Itaposs a burden off of my shoulders and my familyaposs shoulders.  Sharpe continues his fight to help others who have been convicted wrongfully.

Heidi Aragon, from the US, said she first called her husband over to stand next to her in a bid to block him - but still the man wouldnapost stop staring.At this point she stopped and stared back at him, the Daily Star reports.Exposing what happened, she said: Donapost sit there and tell me youaposre not doing something when I have proof. Ini a clip shared on TikTok, Heidi places the phone on a bench to record her form while she is doing squats and she stops as soon as she notices a man walking over. This creepy old guy at the gym kept coming over and staring at me, she explains in text. So I told my husband, and he came over and worked out next to me. Despite her husband blocking the manaposs line of sight, he appears to continue to stare through the mirror reflection. Heidi puts down the dumbbell, stops her workout and turns around to stare back at the man in green top. She continues: I thought he got the picture. I attempted to do my set. Then I got fed up and went over and addressed him.  The microphone picks up a faint conversation of Heidi asking the man to stop this after she walks out of frame. I told himheaposs gonna work out in this corner, he needed to stop staring and making me uncomfortable – his response was aposIaposm just looking aroundapos, the TikToker adds. I then told him I record my workouts and I have him on film. He shut up real quick. Some viewers called for women-only gyms in the hope of stopping situations like this happening. One wrote: This is the reason women stop going to the gym. I only work out in my room now. A second praised: You did good by confronting him! These type of men only go to stare at women and not workout. See it all the time! Thataposs good you confronted him and have it on video, a third added. Try and have your husband with you when you guys go to the gym. You did the the right thing.

But is there a line when it comes to whataposs acceptable for someone to ask you to do  One woman has revealed she was put in a dficult position after her cousin asked her to adopt her children.Unsure of what to do, she posted anonymously on Reddit, asking others for their advice.I, , grew up being pretty close to my cousin, also , she said. Then in high school, she got really into the drugs party thing and ended up dropping out in her senior year. She eventually had my nephew ‘Evan’, now . I babysat a lot for her — I was attending college locally, so I was around to help out. Long story short, the stuff I saw ended up with me calling CPS . They determined it wasnapost bad enough yet to remove Evan but did give her some kind of parenting plan. Not sure what, as she cut off everyone in the family at this point.

Fast-forward to now, I moved away for grad school, then came back to my hometown,” she said as she hadnapost been in contact with her cousin since she had left to pursue her education. She contacted me through an older email account,” she explained. She said that CPS had removed Evan and his siblings Connor, , and Gracie, , three years ago — I wasnapost even aware sheaposd had other kids. After being taken from their mum, the kids had been staying with a foster family. Now CPS was taking away her rights for not working her plan, and she had given my name to them as a relative who would adopt them, she continued, which is why her cousin reached out in the first place. She begged me to take them since I was the only family member who even had a possibility to , the poster revealed. Turns out the foster parents also have my cousinaposs youngest child Anna, , — which my cousin never mentioned!  I guess since was born later in the case, sheaposs not on the same timeline, and my cousin isnapost losing her rights to Anna yet.She arranged to see her cousinsapos kids and theirfoster parents in a local park to help her make her decision.After seeing them, she thought they all seemed happy and it was clear that the kids LOVE their foster family. She continued: The family had two older kids — Iaposd guess older teens — and I could see the bond between all of them. I decided not to try and take the kids, but the foster parents are allowing me to stay involved in their le as an aunt figure, she wrote. Evanstill remembers me vaguely, and was happy to see me. She didn’t want to take the kids from the foster home because she didn’t want the drama, she admitted. On top of not wanting to take them from the only home most of the kids remember, I also donapost want to deal with my cousin — sheaposs still using and is not someone I want in my le right now, she sadly admitted. But when she told her cousin her decision, she was furious.  She said the kids deserve to grow up with their family, and Iaposm doing a terrible thing by not adopting them. The woman asked Reddit users whether she was in the wrong for not wanting to adopt the children, but many people were on her side. One person said: Not the a**hole AT ALL!!!! The kids sound like they are in a good place, it sounds like they are happy and healthy and perhaps may even be adopted by them in the future. Bonus, you can stay part of their lives. Another wrote: [Original Poster]’s cousin is right that the kids deserve to grow up with family. But their ‘family’ is the foster parents that have been caring for them for the last three years. Kudos to OP for recognising this and honouring that bond. A third commented: You clearly have these children’s best interests at heart and your cousin clearly does not. Staying with a family that loves them and lets you stay involved as an aunt figure sounds like the perfect solution here. And frankly, your cousin lost her right to claim she knows aposwhat’s best for themapos when she refused to be a decent mother.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Some people find it really dficult to land on the right name, whereas others just instinctively know what they will name their baby. One expecting couple fell into the latter category, and were so sure theyaposd found the perfect name for their son that they decided to announce his name on the very same day they announced the babyaposs gender, at the end of the first trimester. My husband and I are expecting our first baby, and weaposre due in just a few weeks. When we first announced our pregnancy to our family after the first trimester , we also announced our babyaposs gender AND his name, the mum-to-be explained on Redditaposs AITA forum. My sister and her husband have been trying to conceive their third kid for the last five years, however, due to some complications in her previous pregnancy, they have had to do several rounds of IVF.

The womanaposs sister ended up falling pregnant just five weeks after her and later discovered she will also be welcoming a little boy, leading the sisters to get so excited at the prospect of their sons growing up as best friends. Everything was going pretty great until a few weeks ago. My mom decided to come to visit me to help me get the nursery ready, and mentioned that my sister had really liked the name my husband and I picked for our baby and that she had decided to take it, the mum-to-be continued. My mom then asked me what my husband and I would change our babyaposs name to since it would be too confusing to have two grandkids with the same name. I told my mom that we were NOT changing the name of our baby since our hearts were set on it, and we wouldnapost have announced itwe werenapost sure. The mum-to-be later received an angry call from her sister, who said that because this was their miracle baby, she should get first dibs on whatever name they wanted. I told her that she can name her baby whatever she wants, but that weaposre not changing our minds about our babyaposs name, she added, before turning to Reddit to question whether she was justied in refusing to change her babyaposs name. One Reddit user commented: Your sister is acting like the world revolves around her. I bet shes going to throw a meltdownyour kid is cuter. If you have a baby shower she will be mad because how dare you have a baby shower and take all the attention off her and her miracle baby! Or youaposll be gted some item she really wanted at your own baby shower and she will take it from you as she has aposdibsapos. Another added: You announced it first, sister is an a**hole for stealing it without even talking to you. But, I do hope itaposs a name that can have a nickname, for the kids sake.

The rocky environment filled with dust may not sound overly exciting, but this latest photo is creepy to say the least. NASA Rovers can find some interesting things on the mysterious planet, and recently stumbled across a vast amount of lonely rocks. It looks almost like a mass graveyard, giving the planet a very spooky aesthetic. Twitter users have already took to the social media  in the past to describe Mars as a ‘graveyard planet’.In the image, we can see all the rocks scattered closely together to look like a small cemetery.  Grainy details and an abundance of rocks all dfering in size just add to the general intrigue of this picture. It’s safe to say the Rover has been on Mars for a while after launching in July . It will be heading back to planet earth on February .With over .m followers, the Mars Rover Twitter page has gained a lot of popularity, giving users a unique look at the planet.A recent Tweet shared an image of a patch of rock with a surface layer removed to give us a closer look. This left many Twitter users convinced of aliens. One Twitter user replied: “Can you turn over large rocks to look underneath them  Something that may not have been disturbed for thousands of years  Who knows what may be under some of them ” Another responded to the image: “Definitely a tiny white alien.” Some images are more spine-chilling than others, and although some believe the planet is filled with graveyards and aliens, Mars still manages to look beautul.

Sam Smith said that she booked the day off work to decorate the tree, which cost her £ and was supposed to tower over her - and came complete with a working train, moving model village, and a model of Santa climbing a ladder up the tree. But she neednapost have bothered, as what arrived looked nothing like the advert, and the nurse from Liverpool described it as more like a apostwig and two baublesapos that stood just six inches tall. Sam, , soon saw the funny side - saying that the tree came in a smaller package than her phone charger, and is smaller than her six-month-old Cockapoo, Ralph.She said: The tree that was advertised was lovely. It was supposed to be six feet tall with Father Christmas carrying a ladder and a working train. But we got a six-inch tree which was basically a twig with a couple of baubles, a bit of string and a Father Christmas with a deformed face. It looked like the paint had been chucked on. I ordered a charger for my phone that arrived the same day as the tree and the charger came in a bigger box than the tree. We were crying with laughter. It was so funny.  Sam and her mum, Karen, had ordered the tree from online shop Wulimer after seeing it had been reduced from £ to £. The Wulimer website, which appears to have dropped the price of the ft tree even further to £. while claiming they have aposlimited stockapos, bragged that it was handmade and aposuniqueapos. Sam shared a snap of her online shopping fail on social media and other users were quick to share how hilarious they found the incident. Sam wrote: Imagine mum four weeks ago saying aposooh shall we order this tree apos Yeah sound go on then... it arrived today. God knows where itaposs gonna fit.

One reader said: Omg I saw people ordering these on a Christmas group and couldnapost believe people were ordering it. Another said: I saw that tree and knew it was too good to be true. I think it was about £ or something.Sam said: I decorated it and posted a photo of it on Facebook and everyone was saying they couldnapost believe weaposd fallen for it.Weaposve put the decorations on and put it on the side for fun. Karen added: Everyone was laughing and telling us to get our money back but its not about the money, people will fall for it. Although Sam found the funny side and made use of the tiny tree by displaying it in her kitchen, she has requested a refund from the company but is yet to hear back. Sam said: We paid through PayPal so should be able to get my money back. About three days after weaposd ordered it, I sent a photo of it to my friend whoaposd ordered the same tree and theyaposd also received the tiny one so itaposs happened to a few people. I wasnapost expecting what we got but I thought it would just be the stand and weaposd have to get the parts ourselves. Wulimer have been approached for comment but failed to respond.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

In the clip, the time traveller said: There will be a very large meteor shower that lasts for two weeks, it will be seen in the Northern hemisphere, containing the Nozic Message. One of the meteors will seem dferent than all the others, that is because it is a ship landing on Earth, starting preparations for the first Nozic War.” Many were quick to voice their opinion on the theory, with one user even calling out the TikToker whose account has over . million likes and , followers, writing: First thing I would do as a time traveller: create a TikTok.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere.

Bizarrely, the employer wrote back quoting Jim Rohn, an American entrepreneur and motivational speaker. They wrote: Instead of asking how much am I getting, ask Who Am I becoming from this work - Jim Rohn. They then quoted the initial message asking about pay, adding: Sorry this is a red flag. Naturally, this sparked derision online - with many people pointing out that this is an outdated stereotype that is completely unrealistic.

They then sarcastically added: Not saying the base pay is a red flag for me. She shared the post on Reddit, where it racked up hundreds of comments.

Tributes have poured in for Jamie Murray from Fermoy, Cork who was profoundly disabled. Born blind and deaf the youngster was diagnosed with alobar holoprosencephaly , a developmental condition categorised by a failure of the brain’s frontal lobe to separate into two distinct hemispheres.Jamie, who turned  on November , also suffered from scoliosis. He died peacefully on Saturday at home surrounded by his family, Cork Beo reports.His devoted parents Mark and Helena gave their little warrior Jamie  hour care for all of his le. They said they are hugely grateful to the local community who raised in excess of £,in recent years to fund private nurses to come in to the Murray home to help them with their sonaposs physical needs.  Such was the devotion of the nurses that they became family friends. In a message on Rip.ie the family expressed gratitude for the outpouring of messages of sympathy and support at this dficult time. When contacted for the purpose of this tribute Helena said she simply wanted to “thank everyone for the fantastic memories.” Jamie will lie in repose at Ronayne’s Funeral Home in Fermoy from .pm to .pm on Monday and he will be laid to rest in Kilcrumper New cemetery.Mourners are asked to donate to the Holy Family School in Charleville in lieu of flowers. The funeral will be live streamed.Last December Jamie received a bravery medal courtesy of the Garda charity Little Blue Heroes. They treated Jamie to a garda parade complete with flashing patrol cars with sirens, HSE ambulances and units of Fermoy Fire Brigade. The charity has now paid tribute to little Jamie. Our thoughts and prayers are with all his family and friends. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.

I met the consultant in November and she said she couldnapost believe it. That he was a miracle. We never imagined we would have Christmas with him. He is fantastic. He is very strong.” Helena said the Little Blue Hero parade was a great end to a tough year as they had been without their beloved nurses for a period in order to keep Jamie safe from Covid. The guards came with lots of flashing lights and noise in the village. He absolutely loved it. It was great to see it after a shocking year.“ At the time she expressed gratitude to their extended family, neighbours, friends and to Jamieaposs school and the schools of her older children for doing all they could to assist them during Covid when the family had to stay in their bubble. Helena and Mark and their teenage sons Jack and Lucas cherished the time they had with Jamie. Helena said that that they cuddled Jamie as much as they could throughout his le. I am not naïve. He is not going to be around forever. While he is we just want to make him comfortable at home and give him the care he deserves and give him the help that he needs. The nurses we have are fantastic. We would be lost without them. She insisted that Jamie couldnapost have had better big brothers than her remarkably kind and loving older sons. Jamie is survived by his parents, brothers, grandparents Eileen Roche and John and Carol Murray, aunts, uncles, grand aunts, grand uncles, cousins, neighbours, classmates at Holy Family School Charleville and his beloved Nurses Jen, Joanne, Breda and Aly.

After ing home from a trip to Timaru, the woman was unpacking her car when the marsupial, dubbed “the Blacks Road Ripper ” attacked.Police officers received a call on Sunday night from a distressed woman on the South Island city of Dunedin. The University of Otago post-graduate student, who declined to be named, was being held hostage inside her own home by the animal and was too scared to go outside or reach her car.Talking to Stuff, she said: “I had put my stuff on the veranda and as I was heading back to my car ... I heard this rustling. “I thought ‘that’s weird’, and as I was taking stuff from the back seat something ran up my leg. “I pulled it off me, thinking it was a cat, and then I saw it was a possum.” The woman who grew up on a farm and was familiar with possums, promptly retreated inside her house, pursued by the possum. Everytime the possum saw her through the glass doors, it ran at the glass, keeping her trapped there.  She tried to call animal control, but was informed staff were unwilling to come out and referred her to the police. After the non-emergency number to her local police station did not connect, she called the police to help her. Around  minutes later an officer arrived at her house and spoke to her through the window. But the possum rushed at them too and climbed up the officer before they were able to stun the animal with the light from their torch.  The officer was able to safely put the possum in a box with some dried pet food. Like all the toughest crooks, it was loaded into the back of the police car and carted away from its victim. Senior Sergeant Craig Dinniseen said the furry suspect was thought to be either an escaped pet or was recently separated from its mother. The possum was safely released into the wild without harm.

But his musical taste was very dferent to mine, although I did once manage to get him to sing along to Block Buster by the Sweet.My father died in August , just a week before I started high school at Preston Lodge. Irsquod just turned  years old. Soon afterwards, I remember going into his study, which had previously been out of bounds, and sitting in his chair, surrounded by his books, writing materials and music tapes.These were the days when combined radio and tape recorders were popular. His music tapes were in a special box, all titled in his handwriting. Hersquod recorded the music from the radio so the quality wasnrsquot brilliant.There were moments on the tapes when hersquod not switched it off quickly enough, so hersquod caught snippets of the presenter talking, and sometimes the tape had run out before the tune ended.But all this just made the tape collection a more powerful personal connection to my dad who Irsquod recently lost. So, while he had been unable to interest me in classical music while he was alive, I began to listen to his collection after his death. I would recognise tunes and was now able to put a name to them thanks to the titles hersquod written on the tapes.They conjured up memories for me. One was of a rainy Saturday afternoon in which my father invited me to join him in being the conductor for a Mozart tune. So he showed me how to conduct, leading and living the music with our arm movements. We had fun together doing this for what seemed like an hour or so in our small kitchen, as he explained the dferent instruments involved and how they merge together, and the role of the conductor. It was, in truth, a rare moment, but perhaps thatrsquos why I remembered it so vividly.It was the same Mozart tune that played on my car radio last week. It conjured another memory: of me standing in the kitchen being the conductor to the tune, alone, in the weeks after my fatherrsquos death. Irsquod found the tape and recognised the tune. I then learnt every pause, listened to the instruments and conducted to the music as my father had taught me.I didnrsquot understand it at the time, nobody spoke to me about it, but I now realise that I was in deep grief.My conducting the music was an expression of my loss, but I had nobody to talk to about it or process it I couldnrsquot allow the emotions to surface: ldquoBe strong, now you are the man of the family, boys donrsquot cry, they get on with it.My mother was stunned and closed down as well. I somehow learnt that tears, crying and being upset was something to avoid. So I buried my grief.So I did as advised, I got on with it. Irsquove done OK, I think, for I suppose when we walk with a stone in our shoe long enough we get used to it, and after a while stop noticing it. But, of course, it is still there, and only when we take our shoe off and finally find a way to remove the stone do we feel the dference and understand the effect itrsquos had on our walking.Last week was that moment for me: sitting in my car, overwhelmed with emotion from  years ago, remembering myself as a -year-old boy who felt he was unable to talk about what was then the greatest loss in his le.Irsquom a father myself now, of course, and thank goodness times have changed.There is a greater recognition these days of the need to talk, to express emotions and process feelings that our mental health is as important as our physical health, although words are often not matched with resources.But within our families also, we all need safe spaces to feel upset, let emotions surface and receive support from love ones. And that includes recognising our own mental health needs.I know most of us already know the importance of this. I certainly know it, yet despite this, I still tend to ignore the signs Irsquom struggling until my mental health is in tatters, which helps nobody.Just now my kids are having their own challenges, as so many are, and my own emotions have surfaced in my attempts to give support. The temptation was to quickly re-bury my emotions so I could concentrate on giving that support and also not let anyone down that voice is still in my head: ldquoGet on with it, man up.But that Mozart tune stopped me doing this. It made me connect with how I felt. It helped me understand why the adults close to me, when I was that -year-old boy, didnrsquot ask me how I was feeling or give me space and time to talk about my emotions and express my loss they couldnrsquot because they hadnrsquot allowed it for themselves.Mozart that day gave me the gt of self-care, which has helped me be more effective in caring and supporting loved ones, and ing at well at work.Itrsquos never easy to write about a personal vulnerability there is still that fear of ridicule. I had actually planned to write a historical tale this week, but events, and emotions, took over. There is always next time.Remembrance Day is this week, a time when we collectively pause to remember people we have lost in wars.

We want to bring a bit more of his legacy back to the area.ldquoAs Scotland hosts COP, we believe the  Centre is an opportunity for Cockenzie, Port Seton and Prestonpans to be at the heart of the solution to one of the greatest challenges we face ndash a project which could be of local, national and international importance in the story of climate change.ldquoWe want to be a part of the lsquowonderful recoveryrsquo which Sir David Attenborough spoke about so inspirationally when he addressed the opening session of the COP.Professor John Currie, director of the Scottish Energy Centre at Edinburgh Napier University, said: ldquoNowhere has such a facility been created with the aim of providing an attraction with such a vital educational message.Nikki Keddie, stakeholder manager for Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm ndash which is to build a substation on another part of the site ndash said: ldquoThe  Centre is a visionary idea which could create a major visitor attraction in East Lothian, delivering new jobs and economic benefit for many years to come.ldquoItrsquos a terric opportunity for the local community to build on the arearsquos heritage whilst looking ahead to a sustainable low-carbon future, and as a close neighbour to the proposal, we are delighted to offer our support."},{"url":null,"title":"residents-asked-rate-services-council-survey","story":"The survey, which is conducted independently, is an opportunity for people to tell East Lothian Council how they feel about their community, health, economic situation and public services.The council is also keen to hear how people have been affected by the ongoing Covid- pandemic.Councillor Norman Hampshire, depute council leader, encouraged people to take part in the survey.He said: ldquoThe last resident survey, in , highlighted very high levels of satisfaction with living in East Lothian.ldquoThe results provided us with useful intelligence on areas requiring focus, for example enabling people to better influence decisions and priorities for service improvement.ldquoLe as we knew it was then shaken up by Covid- and, while the ongoing pandemic continues to pose a risk to public health, as well as presenting major challenges to services and our communities, it is important that we give residents a fresh opportunity to have their say.ldquoThis is particularly important in helping the council, together with our partners, to plan for the future and ensure the people of East Lothian continue to benefit from high-quality, efficient services.Survey results will be confidential and anonymous and will inform East Lothian Councilrsquos strategies and priorities for the coming years.A sample of , residents across all areas will receive a postal survey, while anyone can complete it online at researchresource.welcomesyourfeedback.net s yyrwm"},{"url":null,"title":"see-bonnie-babies-couriers-1-000-competition","story":"In todays Courier print edition, we feature - for the last time - all the cute kids in the running for the pound first prize.Theyre so sweet that we just had to share them online too!The winner is the little one with the most votes after the final round - and votes can only be cast using the coupon published in this weeks Courier.So pick up a copy today!

Other features, including a croquet lawn, were added in the th century.Paxton was one of the first houses in Scotland to pump water from a local spring up to a storage tank at the top of the house, using cutting edge th century technology.For  years the house remained in the hands of the same family until  when John Home Robertson, the last laird, gave the house and the estate to the nation.

When push came to shove China and India had to support the developing worldrsquos need for cheap, reliable power.As Indiarsquos Bhupender Yadav rightly said: ldquoDeveloping countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels within this scope. How can anyone expect them to make promises about phasing out coal . The UKrsquos position was unrealistic and in the end the US brokered a viable deal with China and India.In spite of Mr Sharmarsquos tears and howls of protest from the usual suspects, COP wasnrsquot a failure. I thought side deals on methane, deforestation, electric cars and so on were very productive. Of course amid much good common sense Boris Johnson introduced a note of absurdity by claiming the talk-fest ldquomarks the beginning of the end of climate change but I doubt anyone was listening.Dr John Cameron, St Andrews.TAKING SOME BABY STEPSBABY steps toward climate change. The world is not on target to keep to .C or anywhere near it, and that isevery promise is kept, an unlikely scenario. A conference of mostly elderly men was never likely to look beyond their own short-term political interests, or invite Greta Thunberg to embarrass them with her withering scepticism.Boris Johnson, the supposed COP  host, flewhundreds of miles in the middle of the conference, to attend a men-only dinner of climate sceptical cronies. It also reminds us of certain correspondents to The Herald or opinionators like Kevin McKenna who repeatedly castigate Nicola Sturgeon, a Glasgow MSP and First Minister of Scotland, for having the temerity to attend a conference in Glasgow, and discuss issues raised with other participating people. She should presumably have stayed at home, knitting or washing dishes: curtains and mouth shut.GR Weir, Ochiltree.* APPARENTLY Nicola Sturgeon believes that Scotland hosting COP has strengthened the case for independence. What COP was held in the UK ndash and thats not mere semantics. It was in Glasgow because Glasgow is a UK city. Plus it was emphatically not hosted, run or organised by the Scottish administration but by the UK Government. Ms Sturgeon was simply a guest, politely invited. But kudos to her ndash her obsession with separatism, even at a forum dedicated to saving the planet from destruction, is unceasing.Martin Redfern, Melrose.WE MUST NOW HALT CAMBOREADERS might think that they have had an overdose of information since COP came to Glasgow.I would like to share one short clip that seemed especially relevant when thinking about the costs involved in dealing with climate change.The woman delegate from the small Caribbean island of Barbados .She stated, very movingly, that the world spent  trillion on the miracle cure of \"quantitative easing\" when the financial economy verged on collapse because of speculators in . More recently, the world has managed to spend another  trillion since the Covid pandemic started.So the money is available to do something about the climate emergency but our politicians do not understand it affects us all. We seem prepared to let them make our situation worse by letting the Cambo oilfield go ahead instead of showing the way to a better future by stopping new and unnecessary exploration for oil.Norman Lockhart, Innerleithen.FORBIDDEN SUBJECTSDURING COP there were two forbidden subjects. Nuclear power and population control. A third might well have been the effect of our Sun on the climate.The climate enthusiasts are selective about their so-called evidence. They have to be, because facts and true science destroy the myth they promote.Malcolm Parkin, Kinross.SCAPEGOATING THE RED DEERI READ with interest Vicky Allans feature on Neil McIntyres book Chasing the Deer The red deer is now regarded as a \"tree-destroying pest\". The only pest on Planet Earth is the animal at the top of the food chain, humankind. Scotland did not host COP because of the actions of the red deer, but due to the actions of the animal which has upset ecosystems until we have put every human on the planet in danger of flood, fire, war and pestilence, and ultimately our own extinction.But hey, why take responsibility for our own actions when its easier and more fun to blame another species Margaret Forbes, Kilmacolm.WHEN PUBLIC TRANSPORT WORKEDCATRIONA Stewart rightly calls out for a joined-up public transport system as a prerequisite for Glasgow acquiring its green credentials .Most journalists working today are too young to remember the monthly Transcard which took commuters throughout the city throughout the s and early s. There was an Inner Transcard covering as far as Dennistoun in the East and Hyndland in the West and an Outer Transcard covering Greater Glasgow including the suburbs. All public transport was covered: buses, trains, boats and subway.Public transport was speedier , more flexible , and more popular.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way. Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

It really opens up their world as they get to know there are other countries and other languages beyond what they know at home,” she said.Tessa Barrett, Deputy Head of School of Hospitality, Management, Tourism and Languages at SERC, said a second language is a wonderful skill to have and can bring great enjoyment to le whatever your age.“We all know that young children are like sponges when it comes to learning new things,” she said.“Likewise, when we get older, there is a strong body of evidence that supports keeping your brain active.“Essentially it is a muscle that needs exercise, and learning a language is one way to help.”Most ReadStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlConcern over PSNI’s role at UVF Belfast Shankill marchMary McAleese still haunted by early le in ‘a hell on earth created by Christians’‘I will do anything in my power to get those boys out’ – defiant Seán Quinn determined to settle old scoresTop VideosPlayVideo: Behind the scenes making Ryanair#s racy cabin crew calendarPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayIrish Sea border is a ‘figment’ of Northern Ireland’s narrow identity issues, says actor Stephen ReaLatest EducationAnti-bullying week: School experience shaped me into a champion says ConlanRate your teacher video craze leaving staff ‘hurt, upset and damaged’, says union chiefVaccine protestors warned to stay away from Derry school gatesAnti-vaccine protesters target Derry schoolPupils’ rate your teacher videos ‘may be criminal’LatestAdil Rashid supports Azeem Rafiq claim – a timeline of Yorkshire’s racism crisisLeonid meteor shower expected to light up skies over BritainThousands of patients at risk of harm while ambulances queue outside hospitalsAcceptance of mother and baby home inquiry proposals a ‘watershed moment’Gail WalkerOpinionInertia of Executive on Covid crisis is frightening,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As I have said, I want to see the total climb further and faster.“I intend to announce very shortly the first in a series of initiatives to complement current vaccination work. These initiatives will include a further programme of walk-in and pop-up clinics - for booster doses, as well as vaccination opportunities for --year-olds, and for first and second doses generally.“I would again urge people who have not yet come forward for their first dose to do so without further delay. Vaccination is the most important thing we can do to protect each other and support our health service during what will be an incredibly tough winter.”The announcement comes with the number of booster third doses delivered in Northern Ireland having passed the , mark.Booster doses will inevitably be rolled out on a phased basis, given the six month minimum gap between second doses and booster doses. GPs, community pharmacies and Trusts all have key roles in the booster programme. Many people may receive a dferent vaccine for their booster from their first two doses and can be reassured that this is both appropriate and safe.In relation to second vaccine doses for  and  year olds, the JCVI has recommended that these should be given  weeks or more following the first vaccine dose.Most ReadStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlConcern over PSNI’s role at UVF Belfast Shankill marchMary McAleese still haunted by early le in ‘a hell on earth created by Christians’‘I will do anything in my power to get those boys out’ – defiant Seán Quinn determined to settle old scoresTop VideosPlayVideo: Behind the scenes making Ryanair#s racy cabin crew calendarPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayIrish Sea border is a ‘figment’ of Northern Ireland’s narrow identity issues, says actor Stephen ReaLatest CoronavirusCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five further deaths and , cases reportedGail WalkerOpinionInertia of Executive on Covid crisis is frighteningMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageMajority of people in favour of mandatory Covid passportsNorthern Ireland operations face cancellation as Covid numbers in hospital riseLatestEx-Trump aide Steve Bannon surrenders to US authorities over contempt chargesAll you need to know about the UK’s coronavirus booster jabs programmeAdil Rashid supports Azeem Rafiq claim – a timeline of Yorkshire’s racism crisisCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five further deaths and , cases reportedLeonid meteor shower expected to light up skies over Britain,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of Health PremiumScrapped procedures ‘forcing surgeons into private sector’ in Northern IrelandCraigavon Area Hospital operating at full capacity as Covid- patients double in two weeksNI students to protest Stormont in call to support health workers PremiumGail WalkerOpinionWe are an international Covid scandal and it is solely down to Stormont’s mishandling of crisis PremiumDepartment of Health and Belfast Trust at odds over why  hospital beds are lying emptyMost ReadStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlConcern over PSNI’s role at UVF Belfast Shankill marchMary McAleese still haunted by early le in ‘a hell on earth created by Christians’‘I will do anything in my power to get those boys out’ – defiant Seán Quinn determined to settle old scoresTop VideosPlayVideo: Behind the scenes making Ryanair#s racy cabin crew calendarPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayIrish Sea border is a ‘figment’ of Northern Ireland’s narrow identity issues, says actor Stephen ReaLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageNorthern Ireland operations face cancellation as Covid numbers in hospital riseAnti-vaccine protesters target Derry schoolOperations face cancellation as Covid numbers in hospital riseNorthern Ireland records highest proportion of Covid- deaths in the UKLatestLiverpool hospital blast declared terrorist attack as taxi driver escapes aliveMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageStephen Port detective ‘thought victims could be drug addicts due to appearance’Justin Bieber announces UK dates in expanded tourTamara Ecclestone ‘so scared’ after home ransacked in Britain’s biggest burglary,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Eimear McGovernTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWho is affected Those living in the Ten Towns network area will be affected by the Firmus Energy price rise. About , customers in the area, which includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Coleraine, Craigavon, Londonderry and Newry, will see price hikes and it’s thought other areas may soon follow suit.Why is this happening Firmus said rising global energy costs had “forced” its hand to put prices up for the third time this year. Firmus gas prices increased by % in October and by % earlier in the year. Wholesale costs make up % of customers’ gas bills, which is why global increases have such a big effect when the companies involved say they can’t absorb the cost.How will it affect me The Consumer Council said the increase would mean the annual bill of a typical household will rise by about £ a year or £ a year for those with a prepayment meter.What has Firmus said Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Speaking to the BBC, Firmus chairman Dr David Dobbin said this is a challenge being faced by every local and national supplier of gas and electricity. Sooner or later, they will all have to put up their costs to meet “huge upsurges” in wholesale energy costs, he said. “We know this is an unwelcome increase, which will have a disproportionate effect on those of our customers who are the most vulnerable.”WhatI can’t afford it It’s undoubtedly a dficult time for many consumers with several price increases coming into play this winter. Firmus said it would work with a local charity to introduce a support scheme to offer targeted help to those most in need, which would open at about the same time as the increase takes effect.High prices are likely to continue throughout the first half of next year according to the Utility Regulator — and it’s been warned the volatility could even last for between  to  months.Read MoreHot tips: Five alternative ways to heat your home as winter months close inMost ReadStephen Nolan sues Sinn Fein supporting businessman over online postsEast Belfast FC striker Danny Purkis: I walked off pitch over fans’ vile abuse about baby girlConcern over PSNI’s role at UVF Belfast Shankill marchMary McAleese still haunted by early le in ‘a hell on earth created by Christians’‘I will do anything in my power to get those boys out’ – defiant Seán Quinn determined to settle old scoresTop VideosPlayVideo: Behind the scenes making Ryanair#s racy cabin crew calendarPlayVideo: Ballyclare Rangers fans venting anger at Steven Gerrard#s departure to Villa goes viralPlayIrish Sea border is a ‘figment’ of Northern Ireland’s narrow identity issues, says actor Stephen ReaLatest Northern IrelandAcceptance of mother and baby home inquiry proposals a ‘watershed moment’Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageRaising marriage age to  in Northern Ireland goes to public consultationStormont told to revisit Covid certs amid warning of health system ‘on the edge’Where are Covid- case rates rising in the UK LatestAdil Rashid supports Azeem Rafiq claim – a timeline of Yorkshire’s racism crisisLeonid meteor shower expected to light up skies over BritainThousands of patients at risk of harm while ambulances queue outside hospitalsAcceptance of mother and baby home inquiry proposals a ‘watershed moment’Gail WalkerOpinionInertia of Executive on Covid crisis is frightening,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

increase in their hourly wages and to get Covid payments.The three-day protest is expected to last until Friday, or “until we get what we want”, said Unite representative Luisa Monteiro,In a statement to the Belfast , Glen Dimplex said they are “fully committed to providing a fair rate of pay which is sustainable in a highly competitive sector”.Union reps said it is more than seven months since workers submitted their living wage pay claims to Glen Dimplex, which according to its website is the world#s largest manufacturer of electrical heating appliances.Read MoreSpirit AeroSystems workers in east Belfast reject pay dealWe were out three years ago fighting for the living wage and we’re back out again,” said senior Unite rep Paul Guthrie.We’ve asked for a % [increase] to bring us up to the living wage and everything management do has just undermined the battle of the working man.”Unite regional officer, Neil Moore added: “Members in Glen Dimplex have been paid the lowest out of any manufacturing sites in the local area.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The union’s general secretary Sharon Graham said experienced operators at the business receive £. an hour, with a new start operator being given the national minimum wage.“The workforce pay claim is for a £ an hour increase with the aim of catching-up the living wage, never mind what is earned by workers at other local manufacturing sites competing for the similar skilled workers amidst a labour shortage,” she continued.Mr Moore added that the Glen Dimplex bosses “need to recognise thatthis strike proceeds all production at this site will shutdown”.Workers estimate the output on one of four heater production lines in the factory alone is worth £k a day,” he said.Management need to see that the impact on the company’s bottom-line of a prolonged strike will dwarf the costs of paying its workforce fairly,” he said.The company has moved in the past couple of days towards where we want to see in terms of a wage, but this is also about respect.The company is still failing our members in terms of back pay… in terms of their ask for a recognition payment for having to work throughout the pandemic. Our members are requesting that the company... in order to get us to a living wage, to show the workers the respect that they deserve, and pay them a decent amount of back pay and the Covid payments that they deserve, for working throughout the pandemic, keeping this factory profitable and keeping production up throughout the past couple of years.”The company has been approached for comment.A spokesperson for Glen Dimplex added the company “is grateful to the majority of its staff in Portadown for continuing to work as normal towards a consensual and sustainable outcome and appeals to Unite to re-engage in a meaningful manner with the Labour Relations Agency process that commenced earlier this week.“Glen Dimplex current base pay rates already exceed the National Living Wage and as part of the current discussions Glen Dimplex has already offered an increase that would exceed what is known as the real living wage and has addressed both requests for backpay and one-off payments.“In addition to this higher base pay, workers also benefit from an hourly bonus payment further increasing pay levels above the real living wage“Unite members who voted in favour of industrial action account for a

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question.

That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI.

Her family said they are incredibly proud of Ava for using her own birthday to raise money and help other children.Ava even decided to have her birthday cake made with the charity’s colours. Her proud mum, Becky McEvoy, said: “The idea came about by me explaining to her that there are children who dont have any hair due to dferent types of sicknesses and their treatments. “I then showed her The Little Princess Trust’s Instagram posts and she automatically said Mammy, can I do that  I want to help boys and girls have beautul hair like mine.’ “Of course, it was no surprise to me, her daddy and the rest of our family. Ava is such a loving, kind and caring little girl that it is just in her nature to help others. “Ava was due to have her hair trimmed when I spoke to her about it so she already had about nine inches of donatable hair but we hoped that Ava would have - inches as she had only decided in the August and her birthday was on November . “My sister, Ava’s aunty Cheryl, set up a Just Giving page to raise money for the charity and we had originally set a target of pound to help the charity with the cost of turning Ava’s hair into a wig for a young person.” Ava has since smashed this target and has raised over pound between the fundraising page and cash donations from family, friends, her primary school and Irish dancing school. Becky continued: “We asked Courtney, at local hairdressers, Hair by CC, to cut Ava’s hair the day after her birthday. “Once Courtney had cut Ava’shair,she jumped up to go look in the mirror and check out her new hairstyle and of course loved it. “Every morning she gets up and looks in the mirror and says Mammy, I just love my new hair. “As her Mammy, I am incredibly proud of Ava, so is her daddy and the rest of her family. Ava is just an inspiration to everyone. “We cant thank everyone enough who was able to donate to help her help a young person feel like themselves again. “Ava has a younger brother who is ten months old and we cant wait until he grows up a bit so we can explain to him how incredible his big sister is.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway,Kilmacrenan Stn, -- noDerry NewsNew book to examine the long lost days of Donegals Lough Swilly train overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Flynn is a Psychology student at Queen’s University, Belfast. We were highly impressed by Flynn’s commitment to his studies, his family and his community.” The bursary scheme was established in  in memory of Patricia Hughes, a well-known teacher at St. Columb’s College. Highlighting the signicance of the bursary scheme, Patricia’s sister, Mary Delargy, said: “After Patricia’s death in , we wanted to do something positive to continue her work as a pastoral leader in St. Columb’s. “Patricia was an extremely dedicated teacher and always went above and beyond for all of her students. In  we established the Patricia Hughes Bursary Scheme. “The bursary provides pound each year for a pupil from a low-income family to support them through their time at university.” “Flynn is a fantastic ambassador for the Bursary Scheme. Flynn has already done a substantial amount of voluntary work to support his community and we were immediately struck by his commitment to the values of the bursary scheme. We are looking forward to working with Flynn over the coming months and years. “We are so appreciative to the Bursary Committee and the wider school community for sustaining the bursary over the past few years. “Family, friends as well as former staff and pupils have contributed signicantly to the bursary and, in doing so, kept Patricia’s memory alive. We know she would be deeply proud of the work being done in her name.” Paacutedraig Delargy, Patricia’s nephew, outlined the success of the bursary to date: “Since  there have been five recipients of the Bursary scheme. “Having finished university myself in , I know first-hand the economic pressures of third level education. The Bursary offers a chance to alleviate some of that burden and recognises the outstanding contributions the boys have made to their school and wider community.” Two of the pupils who have benefitted from the bursary,Odhraacuten McGlinchey andBilly Quigley, recently took part in a video describing Ms Hughes and how the bursary has helped them. Odhraacuten said: “It takes the stress off the bills -it wasn’t for the Bursary, I don’t know what I would do.” Remembering Ms Hughes, Billy said: “My first thought is she always had a happy aura around her. That made her really approachable. There were a few times when I was struggling and I came to Miss Hughes and she was always willing to lend a hand.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway,Kilmacrenan Stn, -- noDerry NewsNew book to examine the long lost days of Donegals Lough Swilly train overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

There were a few times when I was struggling and I came to Miss Hughes and she was always willing to lend a hand.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway,Kilmacrenan Stn, -- noDerry NewsNew book to examine the long lost days of Donegals Lough Swilly train overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway,Kilmacrenan Stn, -- noDerry NewsNew book to examine the long lost days of Donegals Lough Swilly train overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Colum Eastwood Nov   addthis, The British Government have managed over the course of the past year to do something many never thought possible – there is unity among victims and survivors and the political parties in N. Ireland and Ireland in opposition to their legacy proposals which subvert the rule of law and suppresses justice, truth and accountability.  googletag.cmd.push Current Downing Street proposals create a wholesale amnesty for those in state agencies and illegal militias responsible for the worst in the conflict. It slams shut the door to effective criminal investigations, to the already small prospect of criminal prosecutions, to inquests and to civil actions. All should stand in solidarity with victims and survivors. The scale of the amnesty is immense. A recent report said it was the worst proposed anywhere in the world, worse than the + models over recent decades in places emerging from conflict, worse than that introduced by the Pinochet military dictatorship in Chile. STAKE KNIFE IS FRONT and CENTRE Why  What is to fear  The proposals would mean that the current Jon Boucher Kenova investigation into the activities of the British agent known as Stake Kne would be closed. There are people – members or previously members of state agencies and militias - who will not want Kenova to see the light of day, want to see its work and its outcomes suppressed. Stake-kne is front and centre in the thinking behind the London approach.  The justied rage against all of this is rightly directed against London. But suppression of justice and truth is the agenda of state agencies and the illegal militias. Those in command and control of both have a common interest that less not more is known, that the spotlight fades from the brutality of what was visited on the people of Derry and the people of Ireland. UNANIMITY The opposition travel far beyond victims and survivors and political parties. The United Nations Human Rights Council has expressed grave concern over the British Governments legacy proposals and said they foreclose the pursuit of justice and accountability for the serious human rights violations committed during the Troubles and thwart victims rights to truth and to an effective remedy for the harm suffered, placing the United Kingdom in flagrant violation of its international obligations. The Council of Europe speaks out, the Dublin Government, US political leaders… the weight and range of opposition is verging on unanimous. VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS FIRST The most critical voices are those of victims, survivors and advocates. Together they speak out against these proposals. Their voices are clear and true and dignied and powerful. The victims groups I have met with reject these proposals wholeheartedly not because they want to remain in the past but because they have been denied fundamental truths about what happened to their loved ones. For years, families and victims groups have kept up the fight for truth and justice for their loved ones in their own reserved, dignied way. Earlier this year, I called on Boris Johnson to come with me to meet the Bloody Sunday families, the family of Paul Whitters and the countless loved ones of those killed by the IRA and tell them that they are not entitled to go through the justice process like everybody . He is yet to take me up on my offer. It shows that even Boris Johnson cannot look victims and families in the eye. He cannot produce the worst model of amnesty in decades anywhere and then claim that reject it as barriers to reconciliation. I have walked the same streets with victims campaigners where the British Army and paramilitaries murdered their loved ones, I have stood with them outside  Downing Street against these flagrant attempts by the British Government to close off remaining routes to truth and justice. Victims and families deserve respect and to be consulted because the only proper way to a reconciled future is to listen, understand, and engage with those our troubled past has affected most. WE ARE SECOND CLASS The British Government proposals create separate classes of cases. People across Derry will be subject to the rule of law, to criminal investigation for wrongdoing. You and me and our families and friends. But another group of people will receive special treatment because of the unorm they wore. They will not be subject to the rule of law. We will be second class citizens. In this great city, the frontline of democratic resistance to being treated as second-class, now in  it is alive and well. In addition,murder by the British Army, a state force or paramilitary happened in Newcastle, London or any other city in Britain, these proposals wouldnt even be entertained by the British government of the day, never mind being railroaded through against the wishes of those whom it will affect. WAITING As the MP for Foyle, I have raised the cases of Paul Whitters, Julie Livingstone and Paul Quinn with Boris Johnson and have called out his government at every turn when they act in bad faith on legacy. Last November, I called for a public inquiry into the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane and challenged the s that successive British Governments have gone to in an attempt to deny justice to his family including having to pursue accountability through interminable court proceedings. And still the Finucane wait and still so many other families wait for justice, truth and accountability. FOUNDATION STONE Parties here, along with Irish and British administrations, negotiated the legacy proposals contained within the Stormont House Agreement, including establishing the Historical Investigations Unit. While the SDLP wanted legacy processes to be more rigorous with more powers to get to the truth, Stormont House was the agreement. It remains the foundation stone. Nowyou wore a maroon beret or a balaclava, the Tories an others are looking the other way on your crime for political expediency. TOGETHER We have now reached a critical juncture in how we choose to stand up for victims and their families as well as truth, justice, and accountability for all. The SDLP will never allow the British government to trample over internationally recognised agreements, and more importantly, the rights and wishes of victims and families to pursue truth and justice. Victims and their families will continue their long march against unfair legacy proposals, and we will be with them every step of the way.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway,Kilmacrenan Stn, -- noDerry NewsNew book to examine the long lost days of Donegals Lough Swilly train overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The PSNI have arrested a man on suspicion of arsonLocal NewsRathmore Road fire: -year-old man arrested overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Snow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snapWeatherSnow possible with Ireland on weather alert for cold snap overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway,Kilmacrenan Stn, -- noDerry NewsNew book to examine the long lost days of Donegals Lough Swilly train overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The general reaction to the outcome of COP has been one of frustration – one that Mr Eastwood echoes. India and Chinas fudge on the issue of phasing out coal use angered many and the Foyle MP warned that the move by those two nations has put a constraint on the main of saving the planet. He said: “While a number of welcome measures have been agreed following COP I cannot help but feel the overall sense emerging from the conference is one of failure, frustration and missed opportunity. “The decision to concede to India and China’s demand to phase down, rather than phase out coal is inconceivable. Burning fossil fuels is one of the key contributors to the climate crisis due to the amount of carbon emissions they produce. “While stopping using them completely won’t be easy, it’s the only choice we havewe are going to save our planet. “This COP also failed to adequately address the destruction taking place in our poorer and developing countries as a result of the climate crisis. If we are going to get to grips with tackling these issues then our leading nations must provide support to those with less resources and major corporations must adopt climate friendly practices or face the consequences. “The chance for world leaders to agree a radical worldwide plan to tackle the climate crisis has been blown – but hope is not lost. Its been heartening to see the strength of will that exists to tackle this issue, particularly from our young people. “For too long our politicians have ignored the climate crisis raging all around us and COP has put it at the centre of public discourse. “Real climate action won’t be easy, we will all be required to change the way we live, but there is no alternative and we must take the wins that were secured in Glasgow and push for further movement ahead of COP in Egypt. “The SDLP will continue to fight to ensure that the climate crisis remains the uppermost concern at both Westminster and in the Assembly. “I am currently bringing forward a bill at Westminster which will force the British government to declare a climate emergency, bring forward the date to achieve net zero emissions, introduce a strategy to achieve new green jobs, guarantee a just transition and create a green corporate levy on large companies to help fund climate action. “It’s a matter of deep regret that the North is currently the only part of these islands without dedicated climate change legislation and targets and that must be immediately addressed.”  Mary Robinson hits out at shameful dereliction of duty on climate change     Free Derry Corner goes to Code Red  Landmark receives temporary new look to bring awareness of climate change to city    Put your thinking COP on -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Pic by Mark Doherty.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Leadon Timberframe Derry IHC final Banagher - googletag.cmd.push Lavey - Banagher survived a late scare to clinch the Derry intermediate hurling title with victory over Lavey at Owenbeg this afternoon. In the final minute of stoppage time, Fintan Bradleys lobbed free fell just over the bar, with the rippling of the net setting hearts racing around the stand. Moments later, the final whistle brought the curtain down on a tense, competitive Derry intermediate hurling final, with Banaghers slender two-point lead proving enough to take the title. Erins Own will rue a total of  wides throughout the game, seven of them in a profligate opening quarter which left the Gulladuff men trailing by - to -. It was the attritional encounter that Lavey manager Johnny McGarvey had anticipated, with Banaghers incessant pressing and tackling forcing his side to shoot under pressure. At half time, Banaghers double-score lead was intact, and although Fintan Bradleys frees kept Lavey in touch, by the second water break St Marys still had them at arms . The north Derry side had two opportunities to put the game to bed in the final quarter, and were almost punished when Ryan Mulholland blazed a goal chance wide for Lavey with five minutes left. A frantic final few minutes culminated with Bradleys hanging point that for a moment had hearts in mouths throughout the stand. Banagher advance to an Ulster IHC meeting with either Castleblayneyor Middletownon the weekend of November . *Full report and reaction in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Catherine Comer.Reporter: Liam Tunney Nov Email: liam@derrypost  addthis,  Bridie McMenamin Shield semi final  googletag.cmd.push Magherafelt - Attical- Rossa camoacutegs eased their way into a historic Ulster final meeting with neighbours Creggan of Antrim after a dominant performance brushed aside Down champions Attical on Saturday afternoon. In stark contrast to the previous weeks wind and rain, Saturdays conditions allowed for a much more expressive game, and it was Magherafelt who ultimately took advantage. The Derry champions made one change to the side that ground out the win over Crosserlough in the quarter final half forward Shauneen McGuckin replacing Ellie McGuckin in the starting line up. While the scoreline suggests otherwise, Attical were competitive in the early stages, with Megan Sloan and Shari McNally causing Rossa problems. Magherafelt, though, weathered any early pressure and took a - to - lead into the first half water break, and from then on never looked in any real danger. By half time, the lead was six points, and three second half goals from Sineacutead Comerand Briacuted Corrigan saw the hosts canter home with  points to spare over the Mourne side. Eyes will now turn to the far side of the Lough and Antrim side Creggan, who will pose a much sterner test in the final this weekend. *Full report in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Probably not like. Anyway. For those not familiar and familiar with the process Aaron Cunningham, deputy editor at Chordblossom Addison Paterson, Alastair Simpson, Andrew Lemon, The Thin Air Brendan McKeown, Mr Brian Coney, editor at The Thin Air, Chris Corrigan, head of music Queens University Belfast, Carolyn Mathers, Director of Snow Water middot Christopher McBride, Ciara McMullan, photographer Erika Clarke, Chris Flack, Colin Harper, Colum Fitzsimons, David Roy, Dan Hegarty, Davy Sims, Rachael Campbell Palmer, director Black Box, Dolores Vischer, Monk, Edwin McFee, journalist Gerry Sheppard, Hannah Anderson, Hannah Gibson, Mark Hornby, James Ayo, Robert Brown, Editor at Chordblossom middot John DArcy, Jamie Taylor, beautul Everton fan, Janis Leaden, Amy Nolan, Jimmy Devlin, Joe Dougan, Johanna Leech, Jonathan Stewart, Josh Henry, Jo Wright, Kate Barry, Keely, Keith Millar, Me, Les Hume, Lisa Flavelle, Dylan Murphy and Jack Rapanakis, Mari Jackson, Mark Millar, Brendan McGoran, Meghan Gilleece, Thee Micky Ferry, Thee Nance Hall, Nattassa Latcham, Niall Byrne, Olga Kaye, Patricia McConville, Paddy Craig, Music Peter Cinnamond, Phil McCarroll, Ralph McClean, Roisin McNickle, Rory McConnell, Ruth McCarthy, Sara Champ, Sarah Kiely, Sean Kelly, Sean McCann, Simon Oliver, Siobhan McAndrew, Stephen McCaulay of the wonderful taste, handsome Stevie Lennox, Steve Stockman, Stuart Fletcher, Stuart Bailie obviously, Geoff Topley, Thomas Camblin and Saul Duffin have decided that Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic, Arvo Party’s Inheritance, Bicep’s Isles, CATALAN!’s Veritas, Danni Larkin’s Notes For A Maiden Warrior, Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave, Jealous Of The Birds’ Peninsula, Joshua Burnside’s Into The Depths Of Hell, New Pagans’s The Seed The Vessel The Roots And All, Peter J McCauley’s Amnesty, Saint Sister’s Where I Should End, This Ship Argo’s Always The Bees Never The Honey, TRUacute’s No Fixed Abode and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won have all been nominated for the best album at the Northern Ireland Music Prize and Amy Montgomery’sIntangible, Bicep’smiddot Apricots, Cherym’sListening To My Head, Dea Matrona’sStamp On It, Enola Gay’sSofa Surfing, Invaderband’sI Wont Remember You, Jordan Adetunji’s Wokeup! and Waldorf  Cannon’sWe Are Your Governmenthave been nominated for best single at event. There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Work started last week on the new facility which is being provided at the grounds of the local gaelic club.The scheme is a joint initiative by the Saul club and Down Council and work is expected to be completed within the new few weeks.The arrival of the contractors on site late Thursday morning marked the end of a long campaign by local councillor Mr Peter Craig.He is delighted work is underway and has no doubt the playground will make a major contribution to the lives of young people in the area.He said the gaelic clubrsquos premises are being used to house the playground because no other suitable sites could be identied in the area.And in a bid to further improve safety standards, Roads Service officials are to provide new lighting along a footpath which runs from Raholp to the GAA pitch.BALLYNAHINCH mdashA senior police officer has rejected claims from a Sinn Fein councillor that a police car sped away from a Catholic couple who had been attacked in Ballynahinch at the weekend.Inspector Paul McClean has refuted Francis Brannfrsquos allegations that police allowed the assailants to escape after attacking the couple in fast food premises at High Street in the early hours of Sunday.Inspector McClean has also rejected Cllr Brannfrsquos allegations that the injured couple were questioned by an officer from a mobile support unit while their attackers were ldquoallowed to escape.Alleging that the Catholic couple were ldquoviciously beaten, Mr Brannf said that after being head butted and ldquobeaten to the ground the woman ran to a nearby police car to get help while her husband was being assaulted.He also said police allowed ldquothe Loyalists to escape the scene of yet another sectarian attack on nationalists in Ballynahinch.NEWCASTLE mdash Two Stormont departments are at loggerheads after Newcastle beach failed a series of water quality tests.Department of the Environment experts failed Newcastle beach because the level of sewage contamination found in the bathing waters was a breach of European guidelines.But the Department of Regional Development, responsible for sewage treatment, has rejected the DoErsquos reasons, claiming other factors are to blame.Only three out of  Northern Ireland beaches failed the quality tests which must be passedbeaches are to be considered for the prestigious Blue Flag quality award. Tyrella passed the stringent tests for the seventh successive year.Announcing the disappointing news for Newcastle, Environment Minister, Sam Foster, said the failure of the three beaches was due to sewage dischargers, which he added highlights the problems caused by the lack of investment in sewerage services.However, the Water Service yesterday stressed that it was unlikely the discovery was due to the failure of the multi-million pound sewage treatment plant which was built at the townrsquos harbour in the s.A Water Service spokesman said there has been no failure at the sewage plant since  and it is therefore questionable that it is the source of the problem.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh Development Association will be unveiling its latest regeneration scheme at the end of the month.The official ceremony will be performed by former Down councillor, Mr Sam Osborne, who will be joined by a number of people from the town and representatives from the International Fund for Ireland.Work on the High Street project started in January and was completed in September and has transformed the area, with the ambitious pound, project including four ground floor shops, two first floor apartments and a cottage.The cottage has recently been sold and the four retail units are currently available for rental with Association officials confident they can secure tenants.Construction work began at the start of the year and the project team behind the scheme are confident the scheme will greatly enhance this area of Killyleagh which is close to the townrsquos historic castle.CASTLWELLAN mdash Elderly people in Castlwellan are being disturbed by children running through their gardens, according to the local SDLP branch.During a recent meeting of the Castlewellan and Kilcoo branch, the chairman, John Duggan, said he was concerned that some older residents were being bothered by a number of young people.Mr Duggan pointed out that Castlewellan was an excellent place to live but said there was an absolute need for children to pay courtesy to their elders within the neighbourhood.ldquoWhat makes a good community spirit is the ability to have respect for others within the community. There have been some episodes recently where children have been running through gardens and hedges at homes of elderly people.ldquoI would ask them to give these members of the community the peace and space they deserve and consider their feelings in pursuit of fun, he said.BALLYKINLAR mdash Ballykinlar cross-community playgroup has been strongly praised by education inspectors for providing a positive ethos which promotes childrenrsquos confidence and self-esteem.The Department of Education report lists a number of strengths of the playgroup which operates out of the old school on the Carricknab Road.Staff are headily praised for their leadership and dedication to the children and the inspectors found there were only a few areas which need attention.ldquoThe staff treat the children with care and respect and provide a secure, supportive environment which helps the children grow in confidence and independence, said the report.SAINTFIELD mdash The achievements and success of the younger pupils at Saintfield High School were cerebrated during a special junior school prize day last week.The principal, Mr Robert Miss, said the school prided itself on being a family school offering support, interest and encouragement in all the pupils strive to achieve.Mr Mills proudly pointed out that the schoolrsquos well established year eight induction programme seeks to ensure that all new pupils entering Saintfield High School settle quickly into their new environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_stpatrickday.jpg","title":"Green light for St Patrick’s Day  ","story":"A ST Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick is scheduled to go ahead next year.The Recorder can confirm that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is pressing ahead with plans for the event which regularly attracts thousands of visitors to the town.The cross-community spectacular was last held in , with last yearrsquos event one of the districtrsquos first high profile casualties of the emerging coronavirus pandemic.The parade was cancelled due to lockdown restrictions to help prevent the spread of the deadly virus, but council officials are confident the event can go ahead next March.With Covid restrictions now eased, they are keen to see the  parade take place with details surprisingly unveiled to councillors in private during Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.As the public health emergency has eased slightly, a number of councillors believe that as the parade is an outdoor event, it will be able to proceed, provided people continue to exercise caution.Downpatrick area councillor, Dermot Curran, said while there are over four months to go before the parade would be held, ious plans have to be put in place.He said decisions have to be taken now to ensure that all the pieces in the eventrsquos jigsaw are in place and believes that the current environment allows for the popular event to proceed.ldquoPublic health advice rightly prompted the decision to cancel the last two St Patrickrsquos Day parades but the situation has changed.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in .. It is fair to say she looked right at home and will likely make further improvement now that she knows the drill.Nuala Taylor, coaxed into racing by her husband John, who wanted her to know how much he had suffered at Comber, couldnrsquot see what the fuss was about as she flew round in . .Wayne Giles gets a bit of teasing for being in the ladiesrsquo race due to being over  but he takes it in good part.He has even volunteered to shave his legs to help him blend in for the team photo.

She placed st in ..Alison Carroll in contrast said that this was possibly her most enjoyable cross country race ever and she was well pleased with her time of ..Sam Anderson, going from marathon distance to this shorter effort, was afraid of being last but she was far from it and has even signed up for the next event in two weeks time. Her time of . earned her th slot.With the ladies done and dusted, the men swarmed to the start area. There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes.

Eamon was th , John thand Patrick th in ..With banana bread and chocolate on hand to revive them, the mood at the finish line was buoyant and the whole EDAC contingent went home satisfied with having made good use of the day.The Born  Run team are excited to be back in business after the long layoff during the pandemic.They welcomed back the runners with open arms to the first event of six in the lsquoWinter Run Forest Runrsquo series, namely the Minnowburn K and K. Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast. Rachel finished th in a time of .. A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -. The next steps are procurement and progression to construction.ldquoProgression to construction will, however, depend on budget allocations made to the Department in future years.

However the report could take a further six months or more to complete, the spokesperson confirmed.Education officials have also revealed that an addendum to the original business case was completed and approved in March this year.They say the new school project was issued for tender in October with a target of contract award by the second quarter of  ldquoto complete a -month contract period for construction of the new school building and associated works..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_tollymore.jpg","title":"Tollymore United’s Stormort and Soccer Splits talk looks back on events surrounding partition  ","story":"A LOCAL soccer clubrsquos history project marking the th anniversary of the founding of Northern Ireland is nearing its completion.The final talk in Tollymore Unitedrsquos very successful lsquoStormont and Soccer Splitsrsquo project takes place tomorrow evening at .pm at Greenhill YMCArsquos Community Hub.The talk will be delivered by leading historian Dr Cormac Moore and will be streamed live on https:vimeo event  ffdb.Dr Moore will discuss the day-to-day effect of partition on business, unions, the law, religion, education, sport road and rail links.Of particular interest will be the Belfast trade boycott which was ordered by Daacuteil Eacuteireann.The Stormont and Soccer Splits project is funded by the Northern Ireland Officersquos Shared History Fund, administered by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.

A nation which remembers the evils of fascism and honours those who fought to defend it will be the better for so doing. As a country we should have a more rounded view of the way of the world for remembering the sacrice of pervious generations, a realisation that there is real evil out there and sometimes war is a moral imperative in order to be on the side of right.Saturday’s Festival of Remembrance was a fitting reminder of the price which was paid because it had to be paid.But there was a glaring omission which should cause us to reflect.Around a year ago I spoke to a friend about ways in which the centenary of Northern Ireland could be marked. He came back to me with a set of excellent ideas, one of which was to lobby the Royal British Legion for inclusion of a tribute to the sacrice made to defend Northern Ireland’s place within the UK over the last  years in the Festival of Remembrance. Jim Allister raised this issue with the NIO both in a meeting and in writing. He wrote to the Royal British Legion on the matter. He raised it with the Northern Ireland Veterans’ Commissioner and I know Mr Kinahan sought to progress the matter. Yet on Saturday reference to this part of the UK was absent.An ideal opportunity to remember the service and sacrice of the B Specials, the RUC, the UDR and the countless British Army regiments who served in Northern Ireland and gave so much was lost.An opportunity to remember that in part of the UK people were murdered for remembering the sacrice for freedomwas lost.Three summers ago I attended the Royal British Legion event at the Menin Gate to mark the century of the Great Pilgrimage and as I sat in the stands the lady next to me asked why I had a badge on my lapel remembering Enniskillen — I wear it to all remembrance events and to work every day in Stormont to act as a reminder of what some of the people I meet up there did and why I should never be comfortable in the building. I explained to the lady my connection and with tears in her eyes she told me that her husband had dug people out of the rubble that day.That lady hadn’t forgotten. Yet there was no place to remember any of the suffering and sacrice in our centenary year.A nation remembered on Saturday. Yet it is so, so telling when one considers what it chooses to forget.Could it be that the decision to exclude specic mention of Northern Ireland was part of the wider UK government policy of total disinterest in defending the proud record of Her Majesty’s forces in our Province Samuel Morrison, TUV Dromore, Co Down• Other comment pieces below, and beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter• Henry McDonald Nov : NHS workers should be required to have Covid vaccines• Ben Lowry Nov : Essays in  about NI on its  centenary foresaw province staying in UK but not change from within• Owen Polley Nov : Woke theories on history, gender and race get ‘stormy applause’• Peter Robinson Nov : Opinion polls matter,questions are well-defined• Patrick Roche Nov : Archbishop’s comments a moral indictment of unionism• Esmond Birnie Nov : Increasing interest rate now could lessen pain down the line• Kenny Donaldson Nov : Amnesty admission makes mockery of Irish legacy criticism of Britain• Ruth Dudley Edwards Nov : A draining Sunday along the border, then at Lyra film• Writers Oct : We probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book which defends the Union——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Last year Micheal Martin did likewise, the first Fianna Fail leader to take part in the event, and he did so again yesterday.Some observers have suggested that these Remembrance Sunday visits have their origins in the fact that Arlene Foster is from Fermanagh, yet it pre-dates her becoming first minister of Northern Ireland by several years.Another possible reason is that Fermanagh is far to the south of NI, and thus not too far from the centre of the island of Ireland — it is a logical location for an event of cross-border reconciliation.But one of clearest apparent reasons for these visits is to recognise the deep wound that there is in Enniskillen since the Poppy Day atrocity.All massacres of civilians are evil, but the  bombing remains particularly fresh in public memory because no-one would have imagined that a remembrance service would be targeted — not even by depraved terrorists. But it was.There is good reason for unionists to be upset by the nationalist rhetoric that has come out of Dublin, particularly since . This has included scathing criticism of the UK amnesty plans, criticism that is utterly hypocriticalin light of Ireland’s own de facto amnesty for the IRA.But at the same time it is important to recognise the deep symbolism of these welcome and poignant Remembrance Sunday visits to Enniskillen, and the way that successive Irish governments have made them a fixture. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

General view of the entrance tot he Royal Victoria Hospital AE Department in west Belfast. Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeThe boss of the Southern Health and Social Care Trust said it was “exceptionally close” to declaring a major incident alert.Shane Devlin said the health service in Northern Ireland was “on the edge”.The worsening situation within the region’s under-pressure health system comes amid increasing Covid- transmission rates, particularly among young people.Responding to the incident in Craigavon, the British Medical Association called on the Stormont Executive to revisit the issue of vaccine passports as a priority.Making certication a legal entry requirement for hospitality venues has been credited with driving up vaccination rates among young people in the Irish Republic.North of the border, the Executive has recommended that nightclubs and other venues carry out Covid entry checks and an official app has been developed to enable people to show proof of their vaccine status.However, the administration has stopped short of making it a legal requirement of entry.The issue has ided the five-party coalition, with the SDLP and Alliance Party calling for legally enforceable Covid passports for nightle venues.BMA Northern Ireland Council chair Tom Black said: “We have not even entered the winter months when traditionally we see our hospitals under tremendous pressure.“Hospitals and indeed our whole health service was already struggling, but Covid and the added pressure from an increased number of patients is simply too much.“We need to address these issues now. While vaccines are doing the job of keeping many people out of hospital, we also need to see masks being worn, contacts limited where possible and for everyone to come forward for boosters and flu jabs. The Executive should also revisit the use of Covid passports as a priority.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood accused the two main Executive parties – the DUP and Sinn Fein – of political “cowardice” and he warned that Northern Ireland could be facing fresh restrictionscertication was not introduced urgently.The DUP and Sinn Fein have expressed doubts over a mandatory system, indicating their preference for a “partnership approach” with the hospitality industry.“The message from our health service has been clear – they are on the brink of collapse and want to see urgent mitigations introduced, including the immediate introduction of vaccine certications to take the pressure off staff and allow patients to get the care they need,” said Mr Eastwood.“Health Minister Robin Swannhas previously warned that our hospitals will have to turn people awaythe situation worsens and we saw that play out last night at Craigavon Area Hospital.“Sinn Fein and the DUP have thus far shown stunning political cowardice on this issue, a total abdication of leadership. They are unwilling to take the tough decisions needed to protect our health service and the public. This isn’t easy, since calling for the introduction of vaccine certications myself and party colleagues have been harassed and protested against but our primary concern remains protecting people.“We now face a stark choice, time is running out and this decision should have been made weeks ago. To protect our health service, so that cancer sufferers, people in need of urgent operations and others in desperate need of medical attention get access to the treatment they need, we will have to introduce vaccine certication or further restrictions to stop the spread of the virus.”However, DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said he was not in favour of compulsory certication.“I don’t support that at all,” he told BBC Radio Ulster.“I am very clear that vaccination is the best means of creating normality and it has allowed us to create a signicant normality once again in terms of our day-to-day lives. And I think that, you know, people should get vaccinated and I’ll encourage and cajole and pressurise and have done that with people who I know who have been hesitant.“But forcing people to do something isn’t going to work. It’s not going to get those last few over the line. Over % of people are vaccinated and we need to continue to encourage the remainder to get vaccinated, but forcing them is not going to work.“And I don’t think that creating a two-tier system for so many things is something that I would be prepared to accept.”The ambulance ert at Craigavon was ended at pm on Sunday.Southern Trust chief executive Mr Devlin, who has responsibility for the hospital, said the “vast majority” of the “exceptionally unwell” Covid- inpatients they were admitting were unvaccinated.He told the BBC the trust was “exceptionally close” to declaring a major incident on Sunday.“The system that we have, particularly with the level of Covid that we have in our hospitals at the moment, the system is absolutely on the edge in Craigavon and Daisy Hilland the other trusts,” he said.Edwin PootsColum EastwoodDUPSinn Fein  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularCovid- vaccine booster programme extended to over-s - Health Minister Robin Swann welcomes newsMan in his s dies following a two vehicle collision on NI roadNI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received itNI Protocol: Dublin called out over ‘hypocrisy’ of its new cross border customs checksProtests to be held on Irish border telling Boris Johnson to ‘back off’ on Article Most PopularWoman and four men arrested in probe into North Antrim UDABallymena Remembers: Full picture coverage from the Ballymena Remembrance Sunday serviceGroup behind republican poster on Enniskillen Cenotaph respond to victims of  Poppy Day Bomb at same locationLetter was a disgraceful slur on the memory of the veteran Dennis Hutchings Appeal to find missing youngsters aged -years and -years - last seen wearing pyjamas                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

He has been a very valuable asset to our union and will be sadly missed.Mr Pricersquos contribution will be acknowledged at the Annual Glamorgan County Dinner that is being held at Cardfrsquos Angel Hotel on Friday November .More than  guests and dignitaries will attend the black-tie dinner, with glasses raised to the Glamorgan first team who beat Devon last month at Long Sutton Golf Club in the final of inter-county league.It had been a long wait since , but the convincing - victory in Somerset - which came after Glamorgan topped their group with just one defeat in the entire season - was the perfect way for Mr Price to bow out of the role.As well as the first team, Price has assisted in running the junior teams and the seniors team.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week I joined my fellow Labour MP Ruth Jones, along with Vale of Glamorgan Member of the Senedd Jane Hutt and others, to speak at the s Women of Wales rally in Cardf Bay.The group continues to campaign for justice on their pensions, calling for fair and fast compensation from the UK Government, following the summer finding by the Parliamentary  Health Service Ombudsman that the Department for Work and Pensions should have given more notice of their decision to raise the womenrsquos state pension age.I met group members outside the Senedd, many of whom have faced great hardship as a result of the DWPrsquos actions, and I will continue to support them in their fight for justice.Irsquove recently heard from many constituents about sewage pollution. It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street. Here they heard the oldest reference to Penarth goes back to Osbert a Norman Knight that granted land there to St Augustinersquos Abbey in Bristol. The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living. Many of the Irish navvies that came over to build Penarth Docks lodged in this area which became known as lsquoDagger Townrsquo and fights, prostitution, opium dens and gambling along with no doubt a murder or two was re. The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
