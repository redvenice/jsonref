It\u0027s a secret codeword. So he left.\u0027He told my mother about it and she said she just wanted her baby to have a name.         Staff at the registry office initially told Bert he could not name his son after the military operation as it was a \u0027secret codeword\u0027. Pictured: Dee-Day as a toddler\u0027So he went back the next day with a copy of a newspaper and told them it\u0027s not a secret anymore, those Germans know all about it.\u0027He cleverly told them he wanted to spell it Dee-Day and eventually they let him.\u0027He has always worn the name as a badge of honour, visiting Normandy on his birthday 10 times in total to be a part of D-Day celebrations.But at times, the name has hindered him.Dee-Day said: \u0027When I was a teenager, I couldn\u0027t lie about my age - everyone knew when D-Day was.\u0027So if I was at the pub trying to get served while underage, they knew. And if I was trying to chat up an older girl, they\u0027d know my age because of the name!\u0027And if I had been out with my friends causing trouble, policemen and other people would always remember me because of the name - not any of my friends.\u0027Other than that, I\u0027ve never had any problems with it. Everyone knows me in the town and it\u0027s just been accepted by everyone.\u0027Everyone knows me as Dee-Day. I think some people have thought my surname is Day and the D is the initial of my first name.\u0027Whenever I tell anyone my name, I do always end up having to tell them the story of how I got it as well.\u0027His middle name, Rodney, is after HMS Rodney – the Royal Navy battleship his uncle Tom served on during the war.Dee-Day, from Hastings in East Sussex, first visited Normandy aged 18, and his last visit was two years ago. During those visits, he has proved popular among veterans because of his name.He said: \u0027There was an ex-paratrooper there one year who was selling a book about his story.\u0027People buying his book saw me being interviewed on French television because of my name and they started asking me to sign their books.          When Bert told his wife May, pictured together, about his suggestion she said she \u0027just wanted her baby to have a name\u0027         For the most part, Dee-Day has had no name-related issues - except when attempting to buy a drink underage, as everyone knew exactly how old he was. Pictured: Dee-Day\u0027s brother Kenny, now 87, mother May, Dee-Day, father Bert, and brother Bertie\u0027Eventually, the man came over and even asked me to sign a copy for him with my name, date of birth and Hastings - then joked for me to go as people weren\u0027t asking for his signature!\u0027His last trip to Normandy in 2017 was with his son - who he also named Dee-Day - and only grandchild Aaron, 24.Dee-Day Jr, 54, went on to serve as a Corporal in the Royal Green Jackets for six years.On choosing his eldest child\u0027s name, father-of-three Dee-Day said: \u0027If I wasn\u0027t going to call him Dee-Day, somebody else was.\u0027No one ever really questioned his name growing up. I know so many people in the town so they all understood why he was called that.\u0027When he decided to join the Army, I asked him if he wanted to change his name but he said no.\u0027They all get nicknames in there anyway, and when he came back from training I asked him what are you called now then?\u0027He was going to be called Chalky White, but because of what his name meant, everyone called him Dee-Day anyway.\u0027Dee-Day\u0027s daughter Avaline, 53, also served for six years as a Lance Corporal within the security and intelligence of the Army.He will have the D-Day heroes in his mind on Thursday, but will not be making the trip over the Channel - instead enjoying a meal with family.Dee-Day added: \u0027I\u0027m lucky just to be alive now, as so many of my friends and people I\u0027ve known all my life have died, so I need to spend my birthday with my family.         He said: \u0027Everyone knows me as Dee-Day. I think some people have thought my surname is Day and the D is the initial of my first name.\u0027 Pictured, Dee-Day as a teenager              Dee-Day even named his own son Dee-Day - who went on to serve as a Corporal in the Royal Green Jackets for six years. Pictured: left, Bert, right, May         He has lived in Hastings all his life, and has been running his antiques shop - a stone\u0027s throw from his parents\u0027 old home - for the past 32 years. Pictured: Dee-Day as a child.\u0027But I will be thinking of our heroes. I\u0027ve visited Normandy and Dunkirk so many times and, after spending a lot of time with the veterans, you could not imagine what they went through.\u0027When you know the damage a gun can do, to fire it at someone must have been so tough. It must have been unbearable for them.\u0027Dee-Day\u0027s parents\u0027 home in Hastings had been bombed by German forces just days before the D-Day landings, and so they had to move into another home in which May gave birth to him.He has lived in Hastings all his life, and has been running his antiques shop - a stone\u0027s throw from his parents\u0027 old home - for the past 32 years.Dee-Day runs the shop alongside Beverley, 63, his wife of seven years.May was a \u0027scrubber\u0027 who cleaned people\u0027s houses in Hastings Old Town, a poor area of the seaside town.Bert was relieved of National Service because of his job as a fisherman, and he also formed part of the local lifeboat crew.He was the head boat launcher and worked on the Cyril and Lilian Bishop - which was used in the Dunkirk evacuations in 1940.Dee-Day has invested much of his time - and around £40,000 - in getting the lifeboat back to its home Paris three years ago.The boat is thought to have helped save thousands of British and ally troops from the beaches.Dee-Day said: \u0027That boat is so special. It carries a lot of meaning for me because of its history.\u0027Because the naval ships were too big to get ashore, lifeboats were used to take troops from shore to the vessels. They carried around 50 people a time. She would have saved thousands of lives.\u0027Dee-Day has also held a keen interest in collecting military gear including badges, uniforms and weapons.He added: \u0027I\u0027ve always had an interest in the military, but I think more so because of my name and the story behind it.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/06/04/10/14346838-0-image-m-20_1559641950188.jpg","title":"Scores travellers line road Appleby towns famous horse fair","story":"Share this article   Cumbria\u0027s police and crime commissioner, Peter McCall, reportedly told residents that he would ban the fair if he \u0027had a magic wand\u0027. Last year saw 23 arrests, 17 crimes and 115 incidents logged by police.  In 2012 the fair was featured in the hit TV series My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding - known for publicising the term \u0027grabbing\u0027. Grabbing is the act of a traveller boy physically pulling a girl towards him that he wants to kiss. It looks violent but most traveller girls will accept the ritual as part of their culture.     "},{"url":null,"title":"Cryptocurrency pioneer man bid Buffett lunch","story":"Share this article A message on his Twitter page read: \u0027I officially announce I\u0027ve won the record-setting 20th-anniversary charity lunch hosted by Warren Buffet.\u0027I\u0027ll also invite industry leaders to meet with a titan of investment.

Goncharova passed away in Paris in 1962, at the age of 81, by which time the gaudy, vibrant popular culture of the peasant society that fascinated her was long gone, deliberately destroyed decades earlier by the forced “collectivisation” of agriculture by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.That lost culture hits you straight away in Tate Modern’s entrancing resurrection of Goncharova’s genius. The first things you see are not her works but popular prints, bold textiles and a country woman’s costume. Her art enthusiastically embraced these flowery, bright influences. In fact she went so deep into Russia’s traditional arts that some of her own works can be mistaken for folk products. Her 1912-13 image The Lives of St Florus and Laurus is a comic-strip portrayal of two Byzantine saints, stonemasons who dedicated their artistic skills to God. Goncharova shows them performing miracles and being buried alive, in images straight out of a Russian icon. In her 1910-11 triptych Christ the Saviour, the big central face of Christ is a homage to the mystical 14th century Russian artist Andrei Rublev.This is Russian modernism, but not as we know it. Goncharova and her lover Mikhail Larionov were the dynamic duo of the Russian avant garde in the years preceding the first world war. In 1913, Goncharova had a smash-hit one-woman show in Moscow, the first time any Russian modern artist got national attention. She paraded the streets in “futurist” makeup with slashes, scars and crosses all over her face. Yet it doesn’t take long to notice that Russians in 1913 had a very idiosyncratic idea of what futurism was.Far from the jagged, restless celebration of speed that the Italian futurist movement celebrated, the paintings gathered here from Goncharova’s sensational solo exhibition are poetic reveries on an older, seemingly eternal world. In Hay Cutting, a peasant swings a scythe while two boys carry freshly cut hay. All wear white smocks that contrast with a green forest beyond. Goncharova abstracts these stark shapes and colours: the peasants are strongly outlined in black, their faces primitive ovals. In Picking Apples, young women in white enjoy a picnic as they collect fruit under the trees, their simplified forms sharpened against a pink sky. It’s like a scene from Chekhov, reimagined by Matisse.It quickly becomes clear that modernism in Russia on the eve of the first world war had almost nothing in common with the image of the Soviet avant garde we still lap up in the west. Really, we’ve no excuse any more for equating early Russian modern art with the abstract propaganda of Tatlin’s tower or El Lissitsky’s red wedge. The museums of Moscow and St Petersburg are full of modernist paintings of viking ships and Orthodox churches. Goncharova was the co-leader, with Larionov, of this folkloric avant garde. There was nothing naive about her project. Her generation were in direct contact with the latest art from Paris, for some of the most extravagant collectors of Parisian modern art before 1917 were Russian.This show includes Picasso’s 1909 early Cubist painting Queen Isabeau, an example of the modernist masterpieces already in Russian collections in Goncharova’s time. Picasso was reinventing art by embracing influences Europeans considered “primitive” – from gothic sculpture as here to masks from Africa and Oceania. That cult of the primal set Goncharova’s mind on fire.Looking closer at the photograph of her with futurist face paint, her scarifications are reminiscent of African masks – or how she may have imagined them. Yet she didn’t need to look to Africa for such so-called “primitivism”. She found the raw and passionate all around her in the Russian countryside. In her most ambitious work, Harvest, she infuses figures inspired by icons and church frescoes with a stark orange flesh colour, reminiscent of Matisse’s Dance. That’s no coincidence. Matisse painted his red-bodied dancers in 1910 for the Moscow art collector Sergei Shchukin. Goncharova painted Harvest in 1911, but she relocates the primal energy of Dance into the middle ages. A naked woman rides a two-headed monster straight out of the Book of Revelation while peasant feet tread out the grapes of wrath.Russia was on the edge of an upheaval of biblical proportions and Goncharova’s paintings knew it. Her depictions of modern city life are fraught with unease and terror. The City, painted circa 1911, shows towering monolithic modern apartment blocks with a factory chimney belching black smoke into a sky already crowded with aeroplanes. At the base of this colossal cubistic nightmare walk tiny people. In Factory (Futurist), one of the massive tubular chimney stacks filling a sky of restless fragments lowers like the barrel of a howitzer.Goncharova’s art is full of passion for the people – but they’re not a homogenous urban “proletariat”. Her Russia is erse and unpredictable. Paintings here from her 1913 exhibition include a depiction of a Jewish neighbourhood and a black female nude. In 1916, she and Larionov went to Paris to experience the heart of modernism first hand. After the Revolution, they had no reason to go home. In exile, she survived by turning her flaming dreamscapes of folk life into brilliant fashion designs. Her drawings for the House of Myrbor in Paris translated peasant culture into jazz-age chic.Right through this exhibition I imagined a soundtrack of Russian modern music. Like Goncharova, Igor Stravinsky and Sergei Prokofiev mixed modernist dissonance with folk sources. In the final room, Stravinsky’s music actually does ring out as you explore Goncharova’s designs for the Ballets Russes. Here among costumes that recreate the raw colours and fairytale creatures of peasant art is Goncharova’s brilliant cubistic landscape of a Ukrainian village, created as a set design in the 1930s. In real life, in 1932 and 1933, millions of Ukrainians were dying in a famine caused by Stalin’s agricultural policies. Many Ukrainians see it as genocide.Goncharova’s ballet set, like all her work, is not escapist nostalgia. It’s an attempt to save an entire world in all its colour and fervour from the tragedy of Russia’s 20th century.• At Tate Modern, London, from 6 June until 8 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58d318e14c02783dfab5b2e98b614afa24070d18/0_143_2770_1662/master/2770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=625264f2ab3fa34dcbb1b370e475752b","title":"werner bischof 1950s america in colour in pictures","story":"The acclaimed Magnum photographer Werner Bischof’s images of 1950s America are shown for the first time in an exhibition devoted to his USA series.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Recently had one of those brilliant moments that any literature loving parent will treasure. My youngest son, 16, expressed an interest in what’s on my book shelves, and asked for some recommendations. Where to start? Anywhere excited, energised and thrilled.I read On The Road straight through one hot summer night when I was 16. I finished the last few pages as the early blue morning arrived gently. And I was changed. The book had an amazing effect on me, and I dedicated the next few years of my life to travelling, experiencing, writing, being, and living what I thought life was all about to the absolute maximum.I’ve read it a few times again over the last 30 years, and my attitude to it has changed considerably. I’m aware now that it was always out of time and out of step a book popular in the 60s, written in the 50s about the 40s. I came to it in the 80s. There are still breathtaking passages of sparkling writing, wonderful imagery and a unique energy and beat. But Dean Moriarty is no longer a hero, and a bit of life experience showed me how callow, false, duplicitous and selfish he was - dying a drugged up death on the railroad before middle age - a dismal end to a life of taking everything and giving nothing. And Sal Paradise was an observer, hanging around and only ever half taking part. Kerouac, himself, died at 47, after years of bitter alcoholism and living with his mother.I still think it’s one of the greatest books of the 20th century, and my changing attitude and reaction to it and its story won’t diminish that greatness. I’ll be fascinated to learn what my 21st century boy makes of it.We’ll be fascinated to hear about it here too. Elsewhere, 25aubrey has just finished William Peter Blatty’s The Exorcist:Never thought I’d say this, but every page is as good as every scene in the movie. Powerfully gripping, one of those rare books that become welded to your finger tips.“Voluptuousness rampant” now, as vermontlogger reports on Zola’s Nana:It’s a highly coloured story of voluptuousness rampant, hurricanes of extravagance, and unhesitating deception all round, with not one honest character, except at moments Nana herself - superbe fille, superbly realized - who is at least forthright about her desires. The writing seems to be freer than in earlier volumes, less drawn from notes, as if it came more easily to him to imagine conversations in the louche world of theatre types and demi-mondaines. This being Zola, there are some very dark passages too, including the final great tableau which neatly ties up a number of story lines amid the noise and alarums of approaching war.“I read Superior: the return of Race Science by Angela Saini in one sitting yesterday,” says gavernism:I was in turns worried, educated, and fascinated by it. Saini takes you step by step through the history of eugenics and phrenology. She shows the worrisome return of certain theories from the late 19th century that seem to be revivified by a cross current of factors. It’s a real thought provoker and I would like to recommend everyone read it, if only to see if you agree with me that it is clearly a timely and possibly timeless book.The “sensational” Lady Audley’s Secret by Mary Elizabeth Braddon has impressed SydneyH:The author is often paired with Wilkie Collins, but in style and content this novel is a match with The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Dickens. I think the text is often noted for its plot, but what is probably under-acknowledged is that the prose is gorgeous. I don’t want to say too much, because it is a mystery after all, but this is the best book I’ve read so far this year.Mann’s attention to detail is microscopic, not only does he take you on a voyage into the human history of history a family’s life, but the circumstances in which it lives - right down to the design of the upholstery of the furniture. You may think this rather dense stuff, but once you get all these details, you get drawn into the fabulous world which Mann depicts.Finally, let’s hand it over to Besonders who has written an extraordinary summary of War And Peace:This book is very similar to Pride And Prejudice, if Jane Austen had written Pride And Prejudice for an Eastenders storyline, with all the characters belonging to high society, fretting about Brexit, and if all of Europe and its neighbours were trying to settle Brexit by battles between their armies and coalitions of armies.The novel is ided into five books, each book ided into three or four parts, each part ided into chapters of two or three pages. My copy is 1212 pages long, not including the epilogues.Book three, part one, chapter seven ends with “And then the war began…” Literally “…” – like a sequel is in production. In my copy that’s on page 672.Book three, part two, chapter 29 ends with “The first shots”. That’s on page 845.That’s 173 pages between the war beginning and the first shots. (Well, the first shots that are part of the novel’s action). And all 173 pages are brilliant.Fantastic. Makes it sound like the book isn’t long enough…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

However, retailers have been criticised for not doing more to tackle the issue at an earlier stage.“This test has potential to shape how people might shop with us in the future so it will be fascinating to see which concepts our customers have an appetite for,” said Waitrose’s Tor Harris.The taxpayer, overwhelmingly. UK producers and retailers pay among the lowest towards recycling and dealing with their waste in Europe. In other countries, the “polluter” is forced to pay much more. In France, a sliding system of charges means those who put more non- recyclable material on the market pay more.Supermarkets are under pressure, not least from the prime minister, to create plastic-free aisles. A growing number of zero-waste shops are springing up and consumers are being encouraged to ask for products to be sold without plastic.Ariana Densham, an oceans campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “This is a genuinely bold step from Waitrose to trial food dispensers so customers can use refillable tubs and jars. Lots of supermarkets are starting to sell loose fruit and vegetables, but this kind of innovation could spark a refill culture that’s so desperately needed to cut plastics in mainstream shops.“The top 10 UK supermarkets produce 810,000 tonnes of throwaway packaging each year, so we need to see other major retailers taking plastic reduction seriously and following Waitrose’s lead.”A choice of 160 loose fruit and vegetables will be available, along with four different wines and four beers on tap to be taken home in reusable bottles and nearly 30 products including pasta, rice, grains, couscous, lentils, cereals, dried fruit and seeds available from dispensers.The “unpackaged” model relying on refills has already been adopted by some independent retailers, delicatessens and farm shops but this is the first time it is being used at a national supermarket chain.For the borrow-a-box scheme, customers will pay a £5 deposit which is refundable when the container is returned. A frozen pick and mix section initially selling fruit such as blueberries and mango will encourage shoppers to bring in their own containers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc952cc0ac00b7614d2293895734b22a0a5a8d2a/0_198_2958_1776/master/2958.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a70024430652d59091bcf741d61fa8f","title":"communism poland democracy pepsi","story":"Thirty years ago, democracy brought us Pepsi, Turbo gum and bananas, but also stress – and an end to our sense of securityHow come I remember 1989 so well, when I don’t remember what I was doing yesterday? Maybe it’s because the 1980s in Poland were so different from what came after. The 1980s were like a sticky, slow reality where everything happened without haste and nothing worked, where often there was no water or electricity. Only the food was somewhat similar to today’s. Now we have Coke Zero and decaf. Back then we had caffeine-free “coffee” (cereal-based) and chocolate-like products – we didn’t have real chocolate or real coffee. In the 1980s, ham was only for holidays. Today, Warsaw is among the most vegan-friendly cities in Europe.We spent a lot of time waiting in queues. For a kid, that was torturously boring. But mothers knew how to remind children this was their only shot at getting anything. Children were key to the process. You had to get in line several hours before the goods even arrived at the store, sometimes about 4pm.A child’s other function was changing the channels on the TV, which would constantly break down. But nothing competed with the atavistic pleasure of banging on a malfunctioning television – it helped work out your frustration at the fact that everything was so shoddy. Glue didn’t stick. Pens didn’t have ink.Still, this period was, in its own way, uniquely peaceful. It was very safe in our police state. We didn’t have competition, or the accompanying stress. There was no rat race. And while that was a source of backwardness, it was also a major advantage that disappeared after 1989. Longing for that old state of things has caused long-lasting, not always irrational nostalgia for communism. Of course, 1989 brought a unique atmosphere of excitement. I was living with my mother in a typically large and ugly block of flats. I was almost 10, but could feel the spirit of the time because my mother was so caught up in it. She was glued to the television, constantly sighing. There were discussions and interviews with people from the opposition who we’d never seen before. They were intelligent, had a great sense of humour, and said things that had previously been unutterable. My mother would never have imagined something like this could happen. But when I wrote the slogan “Down with communism” on a paper airplane and launched it from the balcony, she told me off : there might be trouble. No one knew how the round-table discussions between the regime and the opposition would end.The first free elections, 30 years ago on 4 June 1989, marked a great victory for the Solidarity movement. Suddenly everything accelerated. Everything became colourful and exotic. The omnipresent kitsch did not bother anyone. The first bazaars and the first entrepreneurial startups had already appeared. For the first time in my life I saw bananas: I so desperately wanted one that I burst into tears when my mother said it cost a fortune and she didn’t have the money. She eventually gave in. Suddenly there were colourful key rings, Turbo gum with pictures of cars on the wrappers, the German-language magazine Bravo. Before, we had only known the packaging of such western luxuries. Under communism, apartments were all identical. There was only one kind of everything – furniture, kefir, yoghurt – and there were no brands. People used empty cans with the beautiful logos of Pepsi or 7up as decorative objects, lined up next to each other. After 1989, they appeared with their contents. But they were damn expensive. Warsaw’s first McDonald’s became the fanciest place in the city.After 1989, reality swiftly became dramatic also. The life I experienced was fairly typical of transformation-era society. My mother worked as a middle manager in a large lightbulb factory in Warsaw named after Rosa Luxemburg. We lived in a 38sq m apartment. This was not the social sphere of the opposition, which primarily belonged to the intelligentsia. She quickly came to fear that she would lose her job, that the factory would be privatised and that 8,000 people would become unemployed.Indeed, 3 million people in Poland lost their jobs in just a few years. The finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz introduced a nationwide shock therapy that was aimed primarily at large enterprises. With the opening of the market and the inflow of western goods, the country’s outdated factories collapsed. Today, there is no trace of the massive factory where my mother once worked. Even the buildings have been demolished.That constant fear characterised my teenage years. I knew I had to study to get into the right high school and go to university. Otherwise I wouldn’t stand a chance. My mother warned me that otherwise I might have to become a cowherd.The education boom was one of the most important features of the 1990s– but it was also another source of stress. My generation is very different from those that came afterwards. We are much less relaxed. We are much more concerned with security, because a sense of security is what everyone lost so suddenly in 1989. Many people never recovered from losing their jobs inequality increased drastically.Another shocking development was a new, bitter antagonism between politicians. Before, the Sejm (parliament) worked very harmoniously. There were no squabbles –everything was passed quickly and smoothly. But since 1989, the Polish parliament has been constantly embroiled in quarrels. By 1991, we had 29 parties in the Sejm.As change washed over the country, abortion suddenly became the most important issue for the Polish right. The Catholic church bestowed on itself the right to intervene in political life, as a reward for its previous support of the opposition. Everything that could possibly be baptised was baptised: streets, fire engines, the stock exchange.This was so overdone that the electorate replaced the former opposition with former communists, who by 1993 returned to power as part of a coalition. In 1995, Lech Wałęsa, the hero of Solidarity, was defeated by Aleksander Kwaśniewski, a former minister for sport under the communist regime. Wałęsa had turned out to be such a bad president (egocentric, intemperate, conflictual) that my mother, previously an ardent supporter of the opposition, would mute the television when he spoke. By then we had a remote, so I no longer had to run up to the TV set.Looking back, I believe the true success of 1989 was that former communists remained true to democracy. They did not violate the constitution. They had their faults, of course, but they proved loyal to the newly created democratic system.Recently, those very same former communists ran in the EU elections as defenders of democracy, in opposition to the ruling populists of the Law and Justice party, who are supported by the Solidarity trade-union and the Catholic church. More than anything, this very paradox embodies the success of 1989 – the year our lives became complicated but free. It was the best time in three centuries of Polish history.• Sławomir Sierakowski is a Polish writer and founder of the Krytyka Polityczna (Political Critique) movement"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c68d104260a2d0c583e811f395543323e304524/0_47_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09a4862fae1752d8dd971168510f4f21","title":"tackle inequality land ownership laws","story":"From housing costs to wildlife collapse, we pay the price while the rich boost their profits. But from today we can fight backWhat is the most neglected issue in British politics? I would say land. Literally and metaphorically, land underlies our lives, but its ownership and control have been captured by a tiny number of people. The results include soaring inequality and exclusion the massive cost of renting or buying a decent home the collapse of wildlife and ecosystems repeated financial crises and the loss of public space. Yet for 70 years this crucial issue has scarcely featured in political discussions.Today, I hope, this changes, with the publication of the report to the Labour party – Land for the Many – that I’ve written with six experts in the field. Our aim is to put this neglected issue where it belongs: at the heart of political debate and discussion.Worse still, when planning permission is granted on agricultural land, its value can rise 250-fold. Though this jackpot was created by society, the owner gets to keep most of it. We pay for this vast inflation in land values through outrageous rents and mortgages. Capital gains tax is lower than income tax, and council tax is proportionately more expensive for the poor than for the rich. As a result of such giveaways, and the amazing opacity of the system, land in the UK has become a magnet for international criminals seeking to launder their money.Because we hear so little about the underlying issues, we blame the wrong causes for the cost and scarcity of housing: immigration, population growth, the green belt, red tape. In reality, the power of landowners and building companies, their tax and financial advantages and the vast shift in bank lending towards the housing sector have inflated prices so much that even a massive housebuilding programme could not counteract them.We propose a community participation agency, to help people, rather than big companies, become the driving force in creating local plans and influencing major infrastructure. To ensure a wide range of voices is heard, we suggest a form of jury service for plan-making. To represent children and the unborn, we would like every local authority to appoint a future generations champion.Councils should have new duties to create parks, urban green spaces, wildlife refuges and public amenities. We propose a new definition of public space, granting citizens a legal right to use it and overturning the power of private landowners in cities to stifle leisure, cultural events and protest.We propose much tighter rent and eviction controls, and an ambitious social housebuilding programme. We also want to create new opportunities for people to design and build their own homes, supported by a community right to buy of the kind that Scotland enjoys. Compulsory sale orders should be used to bring vacant and derelict land on to the market, and community groups should have first rights to buy it.We call for a right to roam across all uncultivated land and waterways (except gardens and similar limitations). We want to change the Allotments Act, to ensure that no one needs wait for a plot for more than a year. We would like to use part of the Land Registry’s vast surplus to help community land trusts buy rural land for farming, forestry, conservation and rewilding. We would like a new English land commission to decide whether to make major farming and forestry decisions subject to planning permission, to help arrest the environmental crisis. And we want to transform the public’s right to know, by ensuring that all information about land ownership, subsidies and planning is published freely as open data.These proposals, we hope, will make the UK a more equal, inclusive and generous-spirited nation, characterised not by private enclosure and public squalor, but by private sufficiency and public luxury. Our land should work for the many, not just the few."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d376016bca96f87933cdf9b559092cdb881140ed/0_68_1008_605/master/1008.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f502579cb697483d1eb846a4d3557fd","title":"how we made luniz i got 5 on it us movie","story":"‘Everybody was rapping about getting high but our slang camouflaged it. We got a weed anthem on mainstream radio’The record we sampled, Why You Treat Me So Bad by Club Nouveau, was always the dopest. A million rappers were rapping over another record of theirs, Rumors, but I was always about this beat. It just grabbed you. It was the late 80s when I first heard it – my sister used to play it and I was mesmerised by that “boop boop”, those keys at the beginning. That shit was hypnotising.At the time in rap, everyone was talking about getting high but no one was talking about what it took to get high. We were struggling kids, fresh outta high school, messing about on the streets. It used to be you’d go five and five on a $10 bag of marijuana. Being real comedians, we thought it’d be funny to do a track talking about trying to put our money together to buy a sack. Like, “I think I got two bucks in my sock, what you got?” That was our reality at the time. That phrase just meant you wanted to pitch in on some weed.When it was on mainstream radio, there were people getting down to it who just thought it was a catchy line. Our slang camouflaged what we were actually saying, and that allowed the song to spread to places it couldn’t have if it was real explicit, like, “Roll up, light up, smoke that weed, kids!” After the song blew up, it became universal – you could put five on anything. “I got five on some beer”, “I got five on some McDonald’s”, “I got five on some gas.”It’s a blessing knowing we were able to represent weed culture and put a weed anthem out there on mainstream radio and TV. We killed it with the lyrics, the beat was powerful and it’s got a powerful-ass hook.Yuk and Numskull came to me with the record they wanted to turn into a beat. I knew it already and had the 12in cos I was a DJ. I liked the groove but there was way too much reverb in the mix. The drums were too far back. It didn’t match up with my sound at that time, which was really upfront – I wanted everything in your face. So I slowed down the beat and added bells, voices and scratches.We took it to Pajama studios in Oakland, laid it down and I knew right away it was a good song. Five is my favourite number. I was born on 5 November, and when I played baseball, I wore the number five. So it was already lucky to me. I’d just had a kid when it came out in 95, so when it blew up, it was a good year for me. Did it help pay for diapers and cribs and shit? For sure!I’d done a couple things before this: an Erik B and Rakim remix, a song on the first SWV album … but this was major. People were singing it in Germany, in France. People were hitting me from London. Over the years, Puffy’s used it, Meek Mill has used it, Yo Gotti has used it, J-Lo did a remix, Jessica Simpson did a version. It’s been crazy.To me, it’s a record that says, “Let’s party.” That’s all it’s really saying. “Hey, let’s go get a bag, smoke and have fun.” I Got Five on It means collaborate and get together. Now, because of Us, a whole new generation are about to party to it.• Us is out on DVD on 18 June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cee18bc967afaf4e2b06c22394de801ed45c3c5/0_0_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77753b8fcf45527dbfd269bcbf1f210","title":"should only mmr vaccinated children be allowed a school place","story":"A measles outbreak at three London schools has reopened the debate about vaccinationA measles outbreak at three London schools has prompted Public Health England to issue an urgent warning to headteachers, asking them to encourage staff, parents and children to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.Italian researchers from the Bruno Kessler Foundation and Bocconi University have predicted that the number of cases of measles in the UK could double in the coming decade, and say the MMR vaccine should be a requirement for a primary school place, as it is in Italy. Former president of the British Society for Immunology and professor at Imperial College London“No, the MMR shouldn’t be compulsory. That would only be counterproductive. People will react against it and think they are being bullied and not being listened to. The right way to increase the vaccination rate is to engage respectfully with people, listen to their point of view and provide accurate and reliable information. Trying to compel people to vaccinate would probably be ineffective and could produce a negative reaction that would make matters even worse. We should try to persuade parents it is the right thing to do and a safe thing to do, which will protect all children.“The MMR is a wonderful vaccine. It’s very safe, and very effective. We need to do everything we can to get the vaccination rate up by educating children in schools – and their parents – about the importance of vaccines, and how they work by stimulating your body’s own natural immune defences, not through drugs. We should make it as easy as possible for parents to get their children vaccinated. It would be great if schools could facilitate this and offer catch-up vaccines to children when they start school, which parents could also bring younger siblings along to.” Headteacher at Tittensor first school, Stoke on Trent“No. I am all for vaccination and both my children were vaccinated at a time when there was a lot of scaremongering about the MMR vaccine and its now discredited link to autism. But I would not force other parents to vaccinate because we live in a democratic society and that means parents rightly have a choice. Also, the Equality Act 2010 states that we cannot discriminate against iniduals who have protected characteristics. Therefore it would be wrong to deny a child an education based on a parent’s belief – religious or spiritual – that vaccination is wrong.“There would be an uproar if parents were forced to vaccinate and we have to consider the human rights of the child in this situation. I suspect some parents would refuse to send their child to school, rather than vaccinate. And that’s not fair on the child.” Mother and nursery owner, London“Yes. I don’t accept children in my nursery unless they have been fully vaccinated. I have vaccinated my own child with the MMR and believe that parents who choose not to vaccinate their children are selfish and wilfully ignorant. They pose a danger to other children and to the communities they live in by putting other people at risk.“Leaving your children unvaccinated is, quite simply, irresponsible. Yes, parents have the right to choose – but if your choice is not to vaccinate your child, then I think you should accept there will be consequences for your child as a result of that choice. I used to be a secondary teacher and I strongly believe that education is a fundamental right. But people also have a right to be safe and I think that should be a higher priority.” Director for schools, The Eden academy trust“No. I believe in vaccination and I worry about the effect on society if we don’t have herd immunity. But I feel strongly that if we prevent an unvaccinated child from attending school, we’re punishing them for their parents’ decision. Access to education is a right, not a privilege. It’s not something that has to be earned, or something you need to qualify for.“I have met parents at the special schools I teach at who will swear to their dying day that a vaccination damaged their child. Their lived experiences, which no amount of science can trump, have far more influence on the decisions of some other parents than the overwhelming evidence about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. That worries me. I am sure headteachers would be faced with more than a handful of parents who would risk flouting the law in order not to have their child vaccinated. So I’m not sure compelling parents would achieve anything.” Mother of a child who is immunocompromised, north London“Yes. My two-and-a-half-year-old son, Francis, was 13 weeks premature and has to take daily steroids, due to a chronic lung disease. Although he is fully vaccinated, the steroids suppress his immune system so there is still a risk he could catch measles, and if he does, he is at much higher risk of dangerous complications. He has spent months in intensive care.“I always check before a playdate whether a child has been vaccinated and stay away from social gatherings if I know a child there is unvaccinated. It frightens me that there isn’t enough herd immunity in the UK to keep Francis safe at the moment. I also feel angry, because this is a preventable situation. I’d be very upset if he came into contact with an unvaccinated child at school, who then passed on a disease to him. If outbreaks at schools in London became a regular occurrence over the next two years, I’d have to consider keeping him home from school.“I would prefer to be sure all children in school were vaccinated, though I would be concerned the children of anti-vaccination parents would then miss out, both on vaccinations and on education.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385af3ce46d7c48ee4d64abf251567e4f3f33888/0_39_5880_3528/master/5880.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=241e97ac5ef7f80be124e4c455b0a7d6","title":"teen activists face us government in crucial hearing over climate trial","story":"The suit accuses the federal government of violating young people’s constitutional rights by contributing to the climate crisisTwenty-one youth activists will face off with the US government in an Oregon courthouse on Tuesday, where their attorneys will petition a panel of judges to let their climate case go to trial. Until it does, their attorneys will also argue, fossil fuel development should be halted on public lands.The case of Juliana v the US charges the federal government with violating the constitutional rights of youth by perpetuating systems that contribute to climate breakdown. Those young people – who range in age from 11 to 23 and hail from all corners of the nation – argue that the constitution gives them and future generations a right to an environment free of climate catastrophe.Their previously scheduled trial was abruptly halted in October 2018 after the government successfully petitioned the supreme court for review. Now, the ninth circuit has the final say.“I think what’s at stake is the ability of these young people to vindicate their constitutional rights,” said plaintiff attorney Andrea Rodgers, senior staff attorney for Our Children’s Trust, the not-for-profit representing the youth plaintiffs. The key determination ahead, essentially, is whether kids get a trial over climate breakdown.Those stakes and the government’s handling of the case have catapulted it to rare courtroom celebrity. The youth plaintiffs are media regulars, with seemingly ubiquitous appeal: teen magazines, local newspapers, radio shows and recent appearances on 60 Minutes and in Vanity Fair. Hearings have been a spectacle, regularly mobbed by suit-and-tie types, kids of all ages, tie-dye and purple-haired grannies. More than 70 support rallies were held worldwide in lieu of a trial last fall.The digital following is no less a curiosity. The youth climate movement has begun to claim Juliana as central to its own narrative, using support rallies to train young leaders and to turn up the digital volume on the case with hashtags like #AllEyesOnJuliana. Tuesday’s hearing will be livestreamed and also broadcast into a park in Portland, Oregon. More than 1,000 supporters are expected to gather. Seventeen of the plaintiffs plan to attend and rally crowds after the hearing.Jeffrey Bossert Clark is slated to argue against the trial on the government’s behalf. A former George W Bush administration appointee, he has publicly equated greenhouse gas regulation with socialist attempts to seize the economy and use of United Nations science as synonymous with US rule by foreign scientists.Bloggers, legal experts, scholars and activists have puzzled over the government’s tactics. In legal circles, the case is an anomaly, made an outlier by the repetitive, emergency petitions filed to squash it. That strategy has been repeated in cases on the far-right fringe of Donald Trump’s agenda: cases affecting Daca recipients, immigrants and the national census, and the transgender military ban.The questions raised in the case, however, are increasingly pressing in America, and worldwide. While the UN counted hundreds of climate cases worldwide in 2017, and more than 650 in America, the question as to whether greenhouse gas emissions violate constitutional rights is being pressed primarily by Our Children’s Trust and its partners. The organization has filed legal action in all 50 states with varying results - litigation is still pending in 9 states (Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington). Similar efforts to uphold constitutional rights to a safe environment are also underway in 13 countries abroad. In the Netherlands, such litigation may soon force the Dutch government to take more measures against climate change in a case now headed to the Dutch supreme court. The supreme court of Pakistan and an appellate court in Norway will also hear similar cases soon.The US government has not disputed that climate breakdown is real, or that an environmental crisis looms. In fact, government experts generally agree with the plaintiffs’ experts on the science. Government attorneys have instead argued that the court does not have the legal authority to tell the federal government what to do about climate change, and that a trial would be too burdensome. They have also argued that Americans don’t have a right to “a climate capable of sustaining human life”.That position is one 17-year-old Nick Venner, a plaintiff in the case, called, “kind of ironic because this case is the only way to get it done because every other effort has failed, essentially”. He said the government’s attorneys “really like to keep it in this theoretical phase because, when they do that, they can deny the humanity of the issues that they are dealing with”. Most at issue, he said, are climate policies that are “going to drastically screw over future generations”.Those generations have sought to be heard. More than 30,000 youth signed an amicus brief filed by Zero Hour in support of the plaintiffs petition to move the case to trial. Anadditional 10,000 adults also signed.“I don’t want to be picking these fights. The youth don’t want to be picking these fights. And, honestly, it’s exhausting to be in the streets all the time,” said Zero Hour’s executive director, Jamie Margolin, who is 17. She added she doesn’t see another choice when other efforts have failed. “Our childhoods are being spent begging them to stop ruining our adulthoods, and our adulthoods are going to be spent dealing with the consequences of their actions,” she said.A decision to allow a trial and halt fossil fuel development in the meantime would stall production of 60 new oil and gas pipelines, 32 new liquefied natural gas and coal terminals, and one oil export facility."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd03ee708cf3011facae81ff9dff1389e91d1509/0_295_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1cd00a1a475dc26ccca88d77eee58c0f","title":"max mara showcases in neues with berlin inspired collection","story":"Museum catwalk paid homage to Marlene Dietrich’s gender fluidity and David Bowie﻿Women over 40, once invisible in the fashion world, are taking centre stage. The German singer Ute Lemper, 55, and the model and ocean conservation activist Carolyn Murphy, 44, were the stars of a Max Mara catwalk show at the Neues museum in Berlin on Monday evening. They continue a trend for indomitable older women headlining fashion’s most glamorous events, in which Diana Ross, 75, has performed at Christian Dior’s recent gala show and Stevie Nicks, 71, sang with Harry Styles at a Gucci event in Rome last week.Max Mara, the quiet giant of Italian fashion with an annual turnover of €1.5m (£1.3m), has always dressed professional adult women rather than It girls what has changed is that this identity is no longer a barrier to being a seriously glamorous player in the industry. “Everyone in fashion talks about empowerment now, but in Max Mara’s case it is hardwired in. Max Mara was founded in the 1950s with a clear idea of dressing a new class of women who would be going into the workplace,” the British designer Ian Griffiths said after the show.But Griffiths, who has helmed the brand for three decades, views the vogue for empowerment as a fashion buzzword as problematic. “I think brands like ours need to be very careful because I’m now realising that the progress that has been made in gender equality is so much more fragile than we thought. So if you say that your clothes are about empowerment, you must produce clothes that genuinely are empowering. The message of these clothes is about a woman who is determined to succeed and to overcome wearing clothes in which she will be taken seriously.”Muse for this collection was native Berliner Marlene Dietrich, courageous in a gender fluidity that was decades ahead of her time. Dietrich flouted convention, without forfeiting either status or adoration. “She wore a man’s suit in the 1930s, but she was still one of the most highly paid actresses in the world,” said Griffiths. With sharply tailored trouser suits and ice-white satin blouses, the collection also nodded to David Bowie. “As an art school boy in Manchester in the 1980s, Berlin was everything, and when we thought of Berlin, we thought of Bowie.” The logic for a splashy out-of-season show is that the Max Mara bottom line depends on coats. The collections now shown with great fanfare in May and June, known as “resort” and “cruise”, arrive on shop floors in November. So despite their archaic names, which are anchored in a bygone age of winter holidays, they are perfect for showcasing coats.The show was the first to be staged in the Neues museum, which stood derelict for 60 years after being bombed in the second world war before being reconstructed by the British architect David Chipperfield. The camel coats – Max Mara’s signature – were softened to a chalky sandstone to compliment the wide double staircase in the museum’s central hall, which formed the first part of the catwalk. The models all wore flat shoes, to better navigate the stairs with confidence – except Ute Lemper, who at her own insistence wore tall spike heels under her wide-legged trouser suit. Max Mara made headlines last year when Nancy Pelosi wore a red Max Mara coat, which she had previously worn for Barack Obama’s second inauguration, for a key standoff with President Trump. “I like to think that she chose to wear that coat because it means something to her emotionally,” commented Griffiths. “I hope that it gave her a psychological boost, which is what clothes can do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e25039ee6cc20ddb86c7d17a77dace1c5f9f10f7/0_21_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd4884dde173e920d966850ac5582233","title":"keanu stories fans share unexpected meetings with sweet quiet nervous reeves","story":"Outpouring was sparked by a profile of the actor that declared he was ‘too good for this world’ Hands brushing as he picks up a water bottle. A casual chat about motorbikes at the end of night of bartending. A wink in a Sydney cinema. Fans of Keanu Reeves have been sharing stories of unexpected, fleeting interactions with the actor.The outpouring of stories intensified after a New Yorker story in which writer Naomi Fry proclaimed Reeves to be “too good for this world” and the “unlikely antidote to everything wrong with the news cycle.” The story ended with an endearing anecdote about the author spotting Reeves squeezing into a chair in the cheap seats at a local theatre.In a tweet, Fry dubbed him “America’s crush”, although commentators were quick to point out the CanadianAmerican actor, who was born in Beirut to a British mother and a Chinese-Hawaiian father, is in fact “the world’s crush”.Reeves is back in the spotlight thanks to his role in the new Netflix film Always be my Maybe. In the film he plays a version of himself as lead actor Ali Wong’s new boyfriend, and gets to deliver lines like: ‘The only stars that matter are the ones you look at when you dream.” After the editor of the New Yorker put out a call for Keanu Stories, fans jumped online to share their encounters. But there were already many circulating, thanks perhaps to Reeves frequently travelling alone.One Twitter user remembered meeting the actor 15 years ago after the success of The Matrix as a bartender and described the actor as “the nicest of people”. “We talked guitars, motorcycles and scotch for about 30 minutes,” he wrote.PJ Quint recalled bumping into him in New York City: “I was almost at my apartment building in NYC, and Keanu was walking toward me. I look at him and it registered who he was, he smiled, gave a little wave and said, “Hey, how are you?” It was a quick moment of connection, but I’ve never forgotten it.”This was quickly seconded by Lauren Murdoch: “I had the same moment, in a restaurant in Sydney. Never forgotten it either.”New Zealand actor Melanie Lynskey said she hung out on the fringes of a party with Reeves and talked about animals. “He asked if I had any photos of my dog in costume. (I did.) He seemed like a very beautiful soul from that brief interaction.”Amanda Meynke said she worked with Reeves on reshoots of the John Wick film and once “told him shyly how much his work meant to me in my life.”“He was incredibly kind to me, thanked me so genuinely, kissed me on the cheek.”Australian author Rosie Waterland remembered when she was a struggling university student working at a Sydney cinema when Reeves appeared. Waterland was charged with escorting him to the stage and said Reeves appeared “so sweet and quiet and nervous.”“I was holding a cinema torch and was way out of my depth. He turned to me, while an entire cinema full of people were cheering for him, and said, “wish me luck” and I laughed, because I didn’t know how to respond to that.“So I said, ‘you won’t need it.’ And he looked at me, winked, and said, ‘wanna bet?’ Then he walked down to the front of the cinema, charmed everyone in the fkn room, and left.”Her story prompted a slew of replies. Amber Robinson wrote about serving Reeves at a bistro in Sydney, saying he was “very sweet and apologetic and super polite” after realising there was no table service and he had to order at the counter.Karina shared her story of seeing him play in his band Dogstar in the Western Australia capital Perth in the mid 90s: “He dropped his water bottle. I picked it up, handed it to him, touched his hand. He said thank you. Bliss.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f78d4f970d6068f273d2bfdca18ec7f9bf49bc26/0_423_5520_3314/master/5520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798c9f1b519b95af2f6793fac4b8b00a","title":"bon appetit how i rediscoved the joys of french cuisine","story":"Like many Britons, Felicity Cloake lost her passion for steak frites and creme brulee when more exotic options appeared – so she embarked on a tour of France to find it. Plus: five recipes that fanned the flameI can measure out my childhood in creme brulee. Every special occasion in the early 90s was celebrated with a trip to the same Soho brasserie in London for onion soup and steak frites, always culminating in the same pièce de résistance, a little pot of custard with an eminently smashable sugar top. In the summer, we would go over on the ferry and eat the same thing at the source, to a Johnny Hallyday soundtrack.In this, we were part of a fine British tradition. Long before Elizabeth David shook up domestic cuisine with French Country Cooking in 1951, 19th-century cookbooks were peppered with recipes “in the French fashion”, while the continental restaurants of Soho and Fitzrovia in London were a magnet for Victorian artists and bohemians.Yet although French food has maintained its traditional status at the top of the tree – think of a fancy restaurant and I bet your mind conjures an image straight out of Ratatouille – our passion has been cooling since the turn of the millennium.It was the pesto I noticed first, a sludgy green interloper in the door of the fridge at home, the vanguard of an Italian invasion that would eventually see the Naked Chef cosy up to Keith Floyd on the kitchen bookshelf, and the butter dish on the dinner table replaced by extra virgin olive oil (which, my dad’s anxious face suggested, was expensive stuff, not to be wasted on teenagers).It wasn’t only Italian food elbowing the French stuff out of the picture. Suddenly, every pub did Thai or Tex-Mex next to fiery green curries and technicolour chimichangas, all that solid, bourgeois cooking started to look very vieux chapeau. Who wanted to sit demurely spreading chilly pate on toast when you could eat chilli-spiked nachos with your hands, or tear into a gourmet pizza topped with rocket and parma ham?The food writer Diana Henry remembers the moment well: “I was cooking out of Raymond Blanc and loving French bistro food and then it all changed.” She attributes this partially to the influence of places such as the River Café, but also to a collective move away from the cream- and butter-heavy school of French cooking historically popular in this country in favour of lighter, sunnier flavours.At university, free at last to choose for myself, I too rebelled, scorning the creme brulee on offer at the local branch of Pierre Victoire in favour of a Japanese restaurant called Edamame, where I saved up for weeks to nibble bright-green soya beans straight from the pod. Needless to say, this – and the raw fish that followed – blew my tiny mind, just as the accompanying wasabi blew my sinuses. French food felt beige and bland in comparison. Familiarity breeds contempt, however unfair that may be.Nostalgia eventually saw me crawl back into its buttery embrace, however. Last year, I decided to write a book – One More Croissant for the Road – just so I could spend the summer cycling around France in the name of “research”, the latest in a long line of Britons hopelessly smitten by French culinary savoir-faire.But those six weeks pedalling around l’Hexagone made it clear that I wasn’t that familiar with French cuisine after all. For one thing, it took a while to re-adjust my palate – so thoroughly acclimatised to hot sauce and kimchi, anchovies and miso – to the quieter, subtler pleasures of the provincial restaurant menu, characterised from Brittany to Burgundy by fish in white sauce with stewed green beans (I don’t think I even tasted garlic on my trip – I mean really tasted it – until I reached Marseille).Then there were the myriad hyperlocal specialities I had never even heard of, such as spicy tomato macaroni with braised beef and sausage in Sète on the south coast, or the creamy deep-fried tripe eaten with relish in Lyon. These are now as much a part of my mental image of French food as old friends such as the moules marinières or cherry clafoutis below. New discoveries were as thrilling as the classics were comforting – I thought I was au fait with French food, when I had barely scratched the surface.I am home again now and happily reunited with my collection of chilli oils. Fortunately for my further education, though, I am not the only one with a renewed appetite for French flavours: Olive magazine tipped new-wave French as a trend to watch in 2019, a prediction borne out by restaurant openings including Flamboree!, an Alsatian tarte flambée joint on Old Street in east London Bob Bob Cité, which serves up steak tartare and snails in parsley butter a mile away in Leadenhall and La Guingette, a little piece of Paris in Bristol. Bistrotheque, in Bethnal Green, east London, is due to open a Manchester outpost later this summer.With French food firmly back on the British menu, this feels like the right time to get back in the kitchen and remind ourselves why we fell in love with it in the first place.For all its carefully cultivated mystique, the world’s most famous omelette is surprisingly easy to reproduce – it just takes a bit of elbow grease (or an electric whisk). I haven’t suggested any fillings, as adding extra ingredients to the pan will knock the air out of the eggs, but a few chopped herbs on top are very welcome. You can serve fried potatoes, cured ham, sautéed mushrooms or foie gras, if you must, on the side.Per omelette3 eggsA pinch of saltOil, to greaseGenerous 1 tbsp cold butter, cut into small diceCrack the eggs into a large bowl with the salt and begin whisking vigorously. Once they are fairly foamy, oil a heavy-based frying pan, about 20cm (8in) wide, and put it on a medium heat.Keep whisking the eggs until they are very thick and bubbly, almost like a mousse. This will probably take just under four minutes with a hand whisk.Pour the mixture into the pan and leave to set until it begins to come away from the side of the pan, then gently loosen the edges with a spatula and slide the butter underneath, shaking to distribute it evenly beneath the omelette.Once it is deep golden underneath, but still foamy and wet above, carefully shake the omelette on to a plate, fold it over and serve immediately.Such a simple dish, but such a delicious one, with the added theatre of the shelling operation, of which I never tire. I like to use Norman cider and drink the rest with it, but you can use a dry white wine if you prefer. Chunks of baguette or (or preferably and) hot, salty fries to mop up the liquid are, however, mandatory.Serves 21kg mussels4 long shallots, finely chopped300ml dry cider or white wine, eg Muscadet50g creme fraicheA small bunch of flat-leaf parsley, finely choppedBaguette or chips, to serve (or both)Rinse the mussels in cold running water, then give them a good scrub and scrape to remove any barnacles or dirt. Discard any with broken shells and give any open ones a sharp tap if they don’t close, throw them away, too. Pull out the beards – the fibrous appendages with which the mussels attach themselves to ropes or rocks – by pulling them sharply towards the hinge end of the mussel. If you want to prep them ahead, leave them in a sink of cold water until ready to cook.Put the chopped shallots and the cider or wine into a large pan and cook gently for 10 minutes, then turn up the heat to medium-high.Drain the mussels and tip into the pan. Cover and cook until most of them have opened – about three minutes.Add the creme fraiche and put the lid back on for 30 seconds to allow it to melt. Add the parsley and shake the pan well to distribute, then season gently and serve immediately, discarding any mussels that remain closed.Most of the ingredients for this bistro classic are readily available, although you may have to go to a greengrocer’s for a frisée lettuce. (Other bitter leaves, such as chicory, or the traditional dandelion greens, would also work well. At a pinch, you could use a crunchy mixed salad.) Leave out the lardons if you would prefer to keep it vegetarian– fry a finely chopped shallot at that stage instead, to flavour the vinaigrette.Serves 4½ a slim baguette (ficelle, if you can get it)Olive oil, to drizzle1 garlic clove, cut in half150g smoked bacon lardons1 tbsp dijon mustard2 tbsp red wine vinegar4 eggs2 heads of frisée lettucecurly ene, washed and dried well (see above)Preheat the oven to 200C180C fangas mark 6 and cut the bread into thin slices. Drizzle with oil and arrange on a baking sheet. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until crisp, then rub with the garlic and set aside.Fry the lardons in a dash of oil over a medium-high heat until bronzed and crisp. Stir in the mustard and then the vinegar, scraping the pan, and set aside.Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Crack the eggs into ramekins, then slide them into the water and reduce to a simmer. Cook for three minutes, then scoop out and drain on kitchen paper.Rub a salad bowl with garlic and tear in the salad leaves. Add the contents of the pan and toss together. Divide between four bowls and top each with a poached egg.This dish is the star turn of Gascon cuisine, an apologetically rich gratin of beans and animal fat, studded with various meats and served hotter than the southern sun. The great food writer Richard Olney called it “a voluptuous monument to rustic tradition”.Serves 81kg haricot beans, soaked in cold water overnight1 onion, peeled and halved1 large carrot, cut into chunks1 head of garlic, unpeeled, plus 4 cloves2 sprigs of thyme2 sprigs of parsley1 bay leaf1kg slab of pork belly, bone in4 confit duck legs and their fat (reserve any jelly you find in the tin)6 Toulouse sausages300ml white wineSalt, to seasonDrain the beans well and put them into a very large, ovenproof casserole dish. Pour in water until it comes about 3cm above the top of the beans, then add the onion, carrot, whole head of garlic, herbs and pork belly (if you need to spoon out some water at this point, that is OK – you can top the dish up during cooking). Bring to the boil, then cover and simmer for about two hours until the beans are just tender, but not falling apart.Meanwhile, fry the duck and sausages separately in plenty of the duck fat until crisp and golden.Once the beans are ready, remove the onion and herbs and discard. Scoop out the pork belly and, once cool enough to handle, cut into chunks, discarding the bones.Squeeze the garlic cloves from their skins and mash to a paste with 4 tablespoons of duck fat and the fresh garlic cloves. Preheat the oven to 160C140C fangas mark 3.Drain the beans, reserving the liquid and seasoning it well – this will be your sauce. Grease the bottom of the casserole with a little of the duck fat mix, then tip in the beans, the rest of the duck fat and all the meat, plus any jelly from the duck confit. Mix well, then top with the wine and the bean cooking liquid to cover.Bake for about 2 hours, keeping an eye on it – once a crust has formed, stir this back into the cassoulet, repeating as necessary. By the end of the cooking time, you should have a thick, golden crust.Allow to cool slightly before serving with a simply dressed green salad.This is the creamy, chunky version that you will find in Limousin bakeries, rather than the crisp clafoutis served hot for dessert in restaurants and after dinner. Sturdy and surprisingly portable, it is a good choice for a picnic at the height of cherry season, although make sure you warn people to watch out for stones. Leaving them in may seem like the height of laziness, but in fact it adds to the fruit’s flavour, as well as making life considerably easier for the cook. (The use of demerara sugar is a tip from the food writer Sarah Beattie, who lives in the south-west of France.)Serves 6-8Butter, to grease3 tbsp demerara sugar600g cherries4 eggs100g caster sugarA pinch of salt100g plain flour500ml whipping cream150ml milkA dash of vanilla extract50ml rum or brandyGrease a deep roasting dish about 25 x 20cm (10in x 8in) wide with butter and sprinkle with the demerara sugar. Preheat the oven to 180C160C fangas mark 4.Remove the stalks from the cherries, but don’t bother to stone them unless you are feeling very energetic. Put them in the base of the dish – they should cover it in a single layer. Eat any extra cherries.Whisk together the eggs, caster sugar and salt, then whisk in the flour until smooth, followed by the cream and milk. Finally, stir in the vanilla and rum or brandy.Pour on top of the cherries, carefully put into the hot oven and bake for 50 to 65 minutes until firm on top with a slight wobble in the middle.Allow to cool to warm before serving – although it is also very good cold.One More Croissant for the Road by Felicity Cloake is published by Mudlark.

It’s now almost 12 years since I played in my first tournament in China and since then the women’s game has changed remarkably. This feels like a great moment for women’s football to take centre stage, not just as a Women’s World Cup but as a World Cup that everyone can get interested in.In terms of the wider impact, the last few World Cups have been the most watched sports events of that year and we are now attracting millions of fans from around the globe. Hopefully, we will see lots more people watching the group games as opposed to starting to watch later in the tournament, with England against Scotland in the first game a great example of an opening group game that should attract millions of viewers in the United Kingdom.When we got home after winning the bronze medal at the last World Cup in 2015, we realised just how huge the support had been and this time I will be able to see that for myself because this is my first World Cup watching an England team from the sidelines. I can’t wait to see what it’s all about from a fan and media perspective.Media publicity is going to be very important in helping to build that momentum from the start. So that means mainstream sports correspondents getting there for the first matches and not turning up when it gets exciting after the group stages. I hope they have news every day covering the back pages. It is being broadcast live on the BBC so that is going to allow people to watch all the games on a free-to-air basis. The lack of free-to-air coverage continues to be a barrier for top women’s football matches: the recent Champions League final is a case in point.I actually think we’re past the point of needing to inspire a generation of young girls to play – there are already many girls who have been inspired in the seven years since the London Olympics and since the bronze-medal achievement in 2015 who now want to play football regularly. There are millions of girls around the world who have made that decision already, so now it’s about access and making sure they can continue to improve their skills.What is important is that we try to consolidate young girls and young boys as women’s football fans. We have to make it easy for them to fall in love with the sport and find new favourite players to aspire to be. There have been ticketing problems with some families not being guaranteed to be next to each other. Since women’s football tends to attract more family supporters, this is a costly mistake by Fifa which I hope can be addressed soon to avoid disrupting the watching experience of women’s football’s family fan base.What makes this summer’s tournament even more exciting is that it is potentially the most open World Cup we have ever seen. If you look at all of the groups, each one has a really difficult game for the projected favourites. So many teams now have players who are at top European clubs and are gaining experience of playing in the latter stages of the Champions League or their domestic competitions. That means they are going into big matches tactically ready, in optimal shape physically and with a winning mentality.Scotland are a great example of that depth. They are about to play in their first World Cup which suggests inexperience but nevertheless it’s really hard to call that opening group game against England. It would be naive just to think it’s going to be an easy win for England because they won 6-0 at the Euros two years ago. Scotland have players like Erin Cuthbert, who scored in the Champions League semi-final for Chelsea and won player of the year, Kim Little, who just won the league with Arsenal and Jane Ross, an experienced forward who led the line last season for West Ham.The reality of the situation is that in the dressing room before the game Scotland players and many players from many teams will be thinking: ‘So what if it’s our first tournament? We have players in this room that know how to win and can threaten the opposition’. I think that’s just where women’s football is at the moment - even two years ago if you had said Scotland would have a chance of beating England then it would have seemed unlikely. They illustrate the point well because there are so many teams that have improved in such a short space of time.Italy will be at their first World Cup in 20 years but they have nine Juventus players who have just won the domestic double and I expect they will be the fittest team in their group. Italy have been in the scenic mountains for a pre-tournament training camp which I think is a great idea: to be in a tranquil setting before the pressure of the World Cup kicks in.In Italy’s group Australia are a team who are renowned for their physical, relentless approach and fitness levels but if you watch them more closely they are also tactically very astute and technical. They have creative midfielders, are always looking to use the width of the pitch and have one of the world’s deadliest goalscorers in Sam Kerr.Even if you steer away from the teams that are always the traditional favourites like the US, Germany or France, there are so many emerging sides who have given the tournament real depth. Nigeria are another good example. Their forward line has Asisat Oshoala, who changed the energy of the game when she came on and scored in the Champions League final last weekend for Barcelona, and Ini Umotong at Brighton, who I expect will be snapped up by a bigger club sooner or later. With speed, power, goalscoring ability and big-game experience they are going to cause a lot of problems to whoever they play.In terms of who will win, it is very difficult to predict. France are always strong and have home advantage but there are questions about the team’s resilience when the going gets tough - which it will.I do believe the winner will be a European team like England or the Netherlands. The Netherlands had a bumpy road to qualification but have a complete team in all positions and in Vivianne Miedema a striker who is the best in the world in my opinion. They also have experience of winning a major tournament which could be vital. For England, expectations will be bigger than ever. They have everything required to win and it will take more than ever before to do so.Whatever happens, it should be an incredible few weeks. I’ll be right in the thick of it and I hope you will be too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e89b91b8b4dba80773c1dd88ba577ddbd48bb43/0_53_1435_861/master/1435.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=037a77669add537b2b9a12b374c54a65","title":"real madrid sign luka jovic from eintracht frankfurt for initial 65m","story":"After a season of struggle for Real Madrid, their summer rebuild has continued with the acquisition of Luka Jovic from Eintracht Frankfurt on a six-year deal.The Serbian forward will cost an initial €65m before add-ons. “Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt have agreed the transfer of Luka Jovic, subject to a medical,” the Spanish club confirmed on Tuesday. “The player will be tied to the club for the next six seasons, until 30 June 2025.”Jovic joined Eintracht on loan from Benfica in 2017, with the club eventually agreeing to make the move permanent at the end of the past season, in which he scored 17 goals in 32 Bundesliga appearances, as well as 10 in 14 Europa League games.“From a sporting point of view selling Luka Jovic is a big blow,” said the Eintracht Frankfurt sporting director, Fredi Bobic. “His explosiveness and capacity to score goals propelled us into Europe and we have benefited from more than just his goals in the past two years. “But it was clear that there was a limit to what kind of bid we could refuse. For Eintracht Frankfurt this is a good and important transfer. We wish Luka all the best in the future. He has all the attributes to have a great career. And we are proud that we have supported him on his way.”In March, Real Madrid announced the signing of Éder Militão from Porto for this summer, the 21-year-old centre-back becoming the first transfer since Zinedine Zidane returned to manage the club.Meanwhile, the former Madrid and Spain coach Julen Lopetegui – sacked by both last year – has been appointed as Sevilla’s new head coach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71fe2dfab06736b40c387875ff19f28338e75c93/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36f36a5727b30ae5791955a91218796b","title":"womens world cup 2019 team guide no 18 cameroon","story":"Cameroon, with a solid blend of youth and experience, will hope to improve on their 2015 performanceThis article is part of the ’s 2019 Women’s World Cup Experts’ Network, a cooperation between some of the best media organisations from the 24 countries who have qualified for France. the is running previews from two countries each day in the run-up to the tournament kicking off on 7 June.Four years after impressing in their debut World Cup in Canada, progressing from the group before losing in the last 16 to China, Cameroon are heading to France this summer with a renewed impetus. Regulars at the Women’s Africa Cup of Nations since its creation in 1991 with 11 appearances, the Indomitable Lionesses have finished runners up in the continental showpiece four times. But on the global scene they can only be described as novices, having made their international debut at the 2012 Olympic Games (crashing out of the tournament without a single point).Cameroon sealed their spot at the 2019 World Cup after finishing third at the 2018 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations with a team that had an average age of 27 and a mix of experienced domestic and overseas players that gives the squad a good blend.They usually start in a 4-3-3 formation, reliant on the players’ hard work and aggressiveness to win games. Blessed with a plethora of talented attackers, the Indomitable Lionesses prefer to play on the counter. Gabrielle Aboudi Onguéné and Ajara Nchout Njoya are pacy and clever and play with the sort of pragmatism that makes them thorns in the flesh of rival defenders.Likely to start on the bench, Cameroon’s all-time leading scorer, the 35-year-old Madeleine Ngono Mani, who has scored 40 goals in a 17-year-stint with the national team, is set to play a bit-part role in France. Albeit in the twilight of her career, the former Guingamp striker, who is now with Albi Croix in the French second ision, always performs when called upon.Cameroon have a solid supply line from the midfield to the attack courtesy of the superbly versatile Raissa Feudjio but the ability to stop the opponents is down to the holding midfielder, Genevieve Ngo Mbeleck, whose incredible work rate is key to the team.But for all the talent that Cameroon have up front and in midfield, there are problems in defence. The glory days of 33-year-old goalkeeper Annette Ngo Ndom appear to be over and there are some concerns over whether the four-time Women’s Africa Cup of Nations captain and centre-back Christine Manie, now 35, is past her best too. She was questioned after Cameroon conceded four goals in five games at the 2018 Africa Cup of Nations.Appointed in January 2019, five months before the World Cup, Alain Djeumfa has to shoulder the hopes of fans from a football-mad nation – but he relishes it. The 46-year-old has previously coached a host of top-tier teams in Cameroon. He worked under the former women’s national team coach, Carl Enow Ngachu, and likes to play with a high press. An unflappable and pragmatic tactician, Djeumfa has said he feels his team has the quality and desire to test the planet’s best teams.A lot of the attention will focus on the forward Gaëlle Enganamouit when the World Cup kicks off. A lanky and astute attacker, she turns 27 the day before Cameroon’s group opener against Canada in Montpellier on 10 June. She scored three goals in Canada 2015 and was voted the African women’s footballer of the year after clinching the Golden Boot in Sweden with her club side Avaldsnes. Despite having had her fair share of injuries and the fact that she is currently without a club after departing Málaga in April, the Yaoundé native is poised for a starring role in France.The defender Estelle Johnson is set to make her international debut for Cameroon at the 2019 World Cup in France despite having an American father and a Malian mother. The Sky Blue FC centre-back was born in Maroua, a city in the north of Cameroon, and pledged her allegiance to the country having been inspired by the team’s efforts at the 2015 World Cup. The centre-back hopes to spur Cameroon to a sensational display in France. “I always wanted to represent Cameroon. As a team we want to perform better than we did in 2015 and we know we can achieve something interesting at the World Cup.”Back in the 1970s, Cameroon was one of very few countries to have a woman play for a men’s team in the top league. A true flag bearer, Emilienne Mbango was a starter for legendary Cameroonian club Leopard of Douala between 1970-1973 where she formed a sensational strike duo with a talented teenager called Roger MillaDespite this success for Mbango it was not until the late 1980s that a national team was set up with Regine Mvoue captaining the squad to a maiden final at the Africa Cup of Nations in 1991.It would take time but women’s football began to properly blossom when Cameroon qualified for the 2012 Olympics. The Indomitable Lionesses were also hailed for finishing third at the 2014 Africa Cup of Nations, qualifying for their maiden Women’s World Cup in Canada in 2015 and eventually exiting the event in the last 16 after a 1-0 loss to China.In 2016, Cameroon hosted the country’s first Women’s Africa Cup of Nations amid great fanfare. The tournament was staged in Yaounde and Limbe and boasted record crowds at the stadiums. The hosts lost 1-0 against Nigeria in the final.However, the success of the national team has yet to make an impact on the national scene with an underfunded domestic championship staged in appalling conditions.With lightening pace, quick feet and an eye for goal, the forward Ajara Nchout Njoya is one to look out for this summer. She scored once at the 2015 World Cup and twice at the 2018 Cup of Nations to fire Cameroon to third place. The 26-year-old scored 19 goals in 22 games last season for Sandviken in Sweden before joining Vålerenga in Norway.Reaching the quarter-finals. They have matured since the last World Cup and have made huge strides by playing a Cup of Nations final in 2016 and finishing third in 2018. Anything short of a quarter-final spot will be considered an underachievement.Cameroon’s football federation (Fecafoot) has disbursed about 1.5 billion FCFA (£2m) for the Indomitable Lionesses’ preparation for France.Close to 22,000 male players are licensed at Fecafoot for the 2018-2019 season with just 908 women having licences. During the 2017-2018 championship, 1,452 women footballers were registered with Cameroon’s football ruling body.Njie Enow works for Cameroon Radio Television.

And yet so many of us accept bad service as par for the courseWhen the beautifully curved, extra-high-res screen of your beloved mobile glints up at you from the bottom of the toilet, you reconsider the life choices that have brought you to this point …The choice to leave buying gig tickets until the last minute, for instance. Or the choice to do it on your phone while brushing your teeth. Or, worst of all, the decision to put off fixing the wifi for another week.It’s incredible how much our lives now hinge on technology, and yet it’s also incredible how much of it just doesn’t work properly. Imagine impressing your ancestors with a magic device that allows you to talk to anyone on the planet face-to-face, and then trying to explain why the video call drops every five minutes. Ogg the caveman might not have been able to Google things with his rudimentary tools, but at least they were reliable.It’s baffling how much incompetent technology we put up with when we really don’t need to. If you fell down a huge pothole in your driveway, you’d get it repaired, right? So why do we just shrug our shoulders and accept gaping wifi blackspots in our homes?One of the big reasons is that when something works a bit, it’s a lot easier to ignore the problem than if it breaks entirely. If the wifi is completely down, that’s priority number one and we won’t rest until it’s sorted, but if it still works as long as you stand on one leg in a particular area of the kitchen – well, you can just watch your cute puppy videos there.Come to think of it, why doesn’t wifi simply work anywhere in the house? Why must we contort ourselves into undignified positions in inconveniently located corners of our homes just to send a tweet? According to Neil Illingworth, head of innovation at Virgin Media, the root of this tech problem is – you guessed it – other technology.“Large metal objects, such as refrigerators, mirrors or TVs can block or reflect the wifi signals, leading to slow speed,” Illingworth explains. “Did you know that a microwave oven operates on some of the same frequencies as wifi? Their power is about 10,000 times higher, and safely contained within the shielded oven, but a small amount can leak out. It’s not dangerous, but it can have an adverse effect on wifi.”Let’s face it, we’re all a bit embarrassed to admit we don’t necessarily know what magic words we’re supposed to whisper in the router’s ear to improve the wifi signal. And even if you can make slight improvements by moving the router around, unless you know where the blackspots are, you’re still stabbing in the dark. What if that’s the best we can get for the money?We’re constantly being told how advanced tech is now, and how we practically live in the future, so why can’t the wifi just grow some artificial intelligence (AI) and fix itself?Actually, it can. Virgin Media’s Intelligent WiFi isn’t just a name – it’s a way of setting up your home network so the system itself can detect moments of interference and sort them out. It knows how many people and gadgets are using your wifi, and adapts itself automatically so the things that need the most data get a better connection (um, hello Netflix marathon).Intelligent WiFi works with the Virgin Media Connect app and the Hub 3 to scan your whole network constantly for things that can be improved.It can also handle the really technical stuff, such as working out if something’s interfering with the signal – and then switch frequencies to avoid it.Of course, some wifi problems can’t be fixed with smarts alone – there’s always that one person whose house naturally has blackspots. If it’s you, stop affectionately calling your home “The Void” and plug in a wifi booster – they’re free on some plans.The fact is, there are approximately 10 bajillion more fun things to do with wifi than search for ways to fix it, so try Intelligent WiFi and let the AI revolution do something for you – even if it’s just doubling the speed of the “tickets have sold out” page. It might be intelligent, but it’s not a magician.Looking for faster connectivity? Or just fed up of losing connection halfway through your favourite TV series?

Writer Sarah Pyper shares some handy tips and the best apps to help you stay on top of everythingLike 4.2m others in the UK – and a further 1.8m who’d like to – I often work from home. Once a euphemism for staying in bed and watching hours of daytime TV, working from home is now an everyday occurrence for those developing businesses, working flexible hours around the care of loved ones, or just avoiding spending time jammed into the armpits of their fellow commuters. All you need is a laptop, a reliable wifi connection and you’re set.But if you don’t have reliable wifi, it doesn’t matter how organised you are, how snazzy your tech is, or which shiny new game you’ve got to occupy your kids with, it will all fall apart. Thick walls, mirrors and even windows can create wifi blackspots that turn your home-working dream into a nightmare. However, Virgin Media’s new Intelligent WiFi with Hub 3, WiFi boosters and Connect app can be relied on to save the day. While the Intelligent WiFi system is designed to deliver the best wifi signal across your home, the Connect app also allows you to pause specific devices – which comes in particularly handy when you need to put the kids to bed.As someone who juggles writing and editing with social media side projects and caring for two children, my home isn’t just my castle, it’s my office, my gym, my laundry and my sanctuary – so I rely on home tech and some key apps to get it all done.Digital helpWith digital assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant or Apple’s Siri, you can delegate domestic tasks while you work. They can turn up your heating, adjust the lighting using smart bulbs, feed your pet with devices such as Feed and go Smart Pet Feeder, or control a video doorbell such as Nest Hello so you don’t have to get up to see who’s interrupting you. If it’s time for a break, your smart kettle can start making a cuppa, while your smart toaster warms a slice. Even better, you can link your assistant to a robot vacuum cleaner such as Roomba to clean your carpet, or iRobot Braava, which will mop your floor, meaning you can ace your deadlines and complete your chores at the same time.Keep the kids occupiedA bored child trying to join in your conference call, especially at a tricky moment, has the potential to shatter that illusion of professionalism you’ve been carefully cultivating– just ask Prof Robert Kelly, whose four-year-old daughter interrupted a live TV interview with BBC News. My deadlines and reputation have often been saved by a well-timed gaming app for the kids. Minecraft is a long-time family favourite where you can build entire worlds, and Roblox sees the kids connecting with their friends in a bid to run a pizza parlour, adopt a baby or take care of a pet kitten. If emergency strikes, relinquish your phone and let them take selfies with special effects filters until you’re done. Works every single time.Seek inspirationWhen I need to feel more productive, I listen to the How I Built This podcast’s interviews with successful business owners such as Bobbi Brown for inspiration. Or, for a quick energy boost, the 7 Minute Workout app gets you moving with a set of 30-second exercises. If all else fails, ask Siri to play an upbeat playlist on Spotify at top volume, and thank your lucky stars you’re not in a communal office.Beat the working-from-home bluesThe downsides of working at home can be the domestic distractions (the kettle needs descaling) and feeling isolated (there are only so many conversations you can have with the cat). If things get a little quiet, I switch on Coffitivity or Noisli, which provide background noise so you can pretend you’re strolling through woodland or a Parisian street while you sort out your accounts. To avoid procrastination, I turn to Forest or Tomato Timer. Plant a virtual tree on Forest and it will grow – but only as long as you focus on your work and don’t check any other apps. Tomato Timer helps you follow the Pomodoro Technique where you work intensely for 25 minutes then take a five-minute break when you’ve finished your task.Looking for faster connectivity?

Those kids need help, not isolation and segregation,” Moses said.Other activists have welcomed the new legislation as a way to prevent people from seeking to exploit youngsters. “We believe that this law, if well implemented, will help us in reducing the pull factors and making the streets as difficult as possible, particularly for the exploiters,” said Faith Atwine, deputy director communications, strategy and impact at Dwelling Places, Uganda.However, she cautioned: “We have to stay alert and watch out for any new ideas that these exploiters might come up with, so that we are able to act immediately to ensure children are protected from exploitation by selfish people out there.”Lack of jobs, neglect, parents’ failure to adequately provide for children’s needs and high poverty rates are among the factors that drive children to a life on the streets."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17e6658c77435e3691d51e935cd2714b43ff25c2/0_372_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a8688a61b8c6557e623414567193f6","title":"light therapy golden facial treatment device id rather accept ageing","story":"I don the mask, with its many wires and 150 coloured LEDs, and it does give my skin a glow. It could just be sweat, thoughLook at the hellish picture above these words. It looks as if someone has made a baby drink plutonium. It’s not nice, is it? You’re looking at the snappily named Light Therapy Golden Facial Treatment Device from MZ Skin. A golden facial sounds quite the off-menu request, but this is a big deal in dermatology circles, an at-home version of the LED phototherapy beloved of celebrities. I struggle to reconcile its voguish credentials with the gape-mouthed horror before me.The machine is dull gold with a brown headstrap and is quite, quite chilling. It looks like one of the masks with which Mayans decorated their dead, to face a long battle in the underworld. What a mouthwatering prospect.Inside, it is even stranger, with 150 numbered LEDs arranged grid-like on a face-hugging sheet, encased within the chunky frame. Surely it won’t work. It has a plastic signal box and many wires, and it looks as if someone has grafted the face of Thomas the Tank Engine on to a potato waffle. But where wellness goes, we go. I strap it on. Press the buttons. Wait to ascend to Xibalba, to meet the God of the Corn.Appearances can be deceptive. Of all the stuff this column has looked at, LED phototherapy so far claims the most scientific validity. It was developed to assist pain management and wound healing, after researchers noted the surprising effects of certain lights on skin. The idea is that, at specific wavelengths, photon energy is transferred into cells, activating changes to their collagen production, inflammation response and pigmentation. The evidence points most clearly to benefits around scar healing, as well as acne vulgaris, rosacea, and herpes simplex and zoster. (Oddly appealing names.) But there is more limited evidence that phototherapy may combat wrinkles, brighten skin and generally give you a youthful glow. Early experiments prompted hair regrowth on a rat’s back or something, and since then the dermatological industries have been desperate for us to give it a go.I don’t have a great time inside the mask. I have a small, pea-shaped head and the headset is heavy and large, with only one adjustable strap, so the entire thing feels as if it is hanging off my eyes. I later test it in front of friends, who confirm the look as “very Leatherface” (from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Teeth visible. Eyelids inside the eyeholes, forced closed and sad. It gets more upsetting when I turn the lights on with the wired controller. One can choose between five colours and adjust their intensity, and the timer function goes up to an hour. Yellow light is meant to reduce redness. White, near infra-red light, repairs the dermis. Blue is supposed to be good for clarifying the skin, and also making it look as if you are in a sordid mashup of Eyes Wide Shut and Tron.“Immediately post-treatment, the skin appears perfect, youthful and radiant,” the blurb says. I can’t say that’s true. I endure the mask for 20 minutes, avoiding all mirrors. Immediately post-treatment, I look … exactly the same. I do have a glow, but this is from the light sheen of sweat on my brow and cheeks. Or is it fear?To experience the full benefits, you are meant to do this for half an hour, several times a week. I do a few more sessions, trying different lights, but eventually get bored. Even if the golden facial works as miraculously as claimed, is it worth the discomfort? Or having to spend hours resembling a budget horror villain on his way to meet a Mesoamerican maize deity? It is not. Plus, it costs £385. You could buy a cheap washing machine and an expensive pub lunch for that, and still have change for the bus home. It is hard to say whether or not light therapy is a magic cure. Those with specific skin conditions, or sensitivity to other types of facial, should probably try a clinic session first. Everyone else, take a look at yourselves. If this is the alternative, better to just accept the ageing. I never thought I’d say that. In that sense, it has been a very effective therapy. Sorry again for the picture.Mz Skin’s products boast a plethora of celebrity fans, including Selma Blair, Princess Charlene of Monaco, Jess Glynne and Donna Air.

But when I pointed this out, the furious reaction revealed the strength of ‘married is best’ prejudiceAt the Hay festival late last month, I gave a talk about my new book, Happy Ever After, which discusses happiness data surrounding relationships. My conclusion – that single women might be healthier and happier than married women and married women with children – was met with surprise from many, delight from single women and shock and even outrage from other quarters, especially on social media. Many pointed to their own experience to criticise me, saying that they – or their wives – were happier now that they were married or parents than they were when they were single. One man tweeted photos of his wife as apparent proof. I was accused of spreading propaganda. “How far will the media push this ‘independent woman’ narrative?” was one popular tweet.It is true that there is lots of variation across people, and people are obviously not randomly allocated to marriage – so we cannot know for sure the causal effects of marriage on health and happiness. There is some pretty robust evidence, though, that single people are more likely to foster social connections that bring them fulfilment, whereas married people often find themselves with less consciously chosen social networks, such as a spouse’s family members. Single people are also more likely to volunteer and to participate in social events. By contrast, married and cohabiting iniduals tend to become more socially isolated, even without the excuse of children. The longitudinal nature of these data suggests this relationship is causal, with those entering marriage more likely to lose existing connections than those who do not marry. Social connectedness is linked to happiness – so this might go a long way towards explaining why single people aren’t as miserable as many people would imagine (and, it seems, sometimes even hope) them to be.There is more evidence, but it can never provide a definitive answer on how any of us should live our lives. Instead it is more useful to focus on why so many people seemed to take the suggestion that single women are doing just fine without men and children so personally and so badly. It certainly appears that the “married is best” narrative remains pervasive.A study in Israel (where there are relatively strong ideals around marriage) asked people to look at comparable biographical accounts of both married and single people (invented by the researchers) and then to rate the extent to which they displayed several traits. Most people assumed the married folk scored higher on traits relating to happiness than the “depressive”, “lonely” and “shy” singletons. No matter how single people were described and what great things they had experienced and achieved, people were insistent that their happiness must have been overstated.What is particularly interesting about this study is that the researchers also varied whether or not the single people profiled had chosen their relationship status. Counterintuitively, those who had chosen to be single received lower positive trait ratings than those who would have preferred to be married, even though the former group was living the life they had wanted. It’s as though the choice to be single is too great a societal affront to be sincere – it must be a provocation.Discrimination against single people also rears its ugly head in professional contexts. Married people generally get first dibs on holiday times, and are the last to be asked to relocate offices. Employers often assume that single people are more time-rich than married people, and expect them to put in more hours and effort relative to their married counterparts, the assumption being that they have no other meaningful commitments and are therefore less likely to be put out – so single people work harder and are not rewarded for it.Outside work, the discrimination continues. Singles are excluded from a host of “couple-specific” deals on insurance, hotels, gym memberships, banks accounts and mortgage payments. Laws and other regulations discriminate against singles further. The UK’s marriage allowance, for example, allows one half of a married couple to transfer £1,250 of his or her personal tax allowance to their spouse, cutting their annual tax bill by up to £250.Our insistence on advocating committed relationships through marriage may be caused in part by a desire to defend overarching power structures, such as government, political frameworks and religion. These represent codes and practices that bring a sense of reliability and familiarity to our lives. Anything that might be perceived as what psychologists refer to as a “system threat” can cause us to feel uneasy, and to spring to the defence of the systems that we consider to be working in our favour.In one study from Canada, male participants who were primed to feel that society was suffering economically, politically and socially compared with other countries defended committed relationships much more than the men in a control group. But the same results did not hold for women. In general, men have more to gain than women from existing power structures and systems – such is the nature of gender inequality – so it is not surprising that they defend these systems, including marriage, more vehemently when they are perceived to be under threat.The idea that it is marriage or bust ignores not only inidual differences but also the many ways in which we can find fulfilment in and out of relationships. If we are to start to tackle the narrative trap of marriage, employers must ensure that any flexible working policy is available to everyone, no matter their personal circumstances. There are good libertarian and egalitarian grounds for the state to stop incentivising marriage, such as by removing the tax breaks for married people. The legal system also needs to rethink how it favours married people. If anything, singledom and singletons should be celebrated, especially when wider social benefits are accounted for. Singles have more time to devote to meaningful activities that can benefit society, and they leave more of their money to charity in their wills.Each of us as iniduals can start by caring less about what kinds of relationships other people choose to have, and how they live their lives. If they are not harming us, why should it matter? Perhaps we do see them as a threat to the hierarchies and presumed order in society. Or perhaps we are a bit jealous of them having apparently freed themselves from social convention. Or it might be that we cannot resist making comparisons with our own lives when we hear about how happy other people are: if they are happy, then I must necessarily be less so, as if happiness were a zero-sum game. Whatever the reasons, the key message is that we need to become much more accepting of the myriad ways in which different people can be differently happy. In so doing, we could all become a little happier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cec4521d03b7178f6aee65a20088776bb4a2b01/0_0_6366_3820/master/6366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b4557fc009bbba7b33bda6ebcabd46b","title":"why parents are addicted to calpol","story":"Calpol is only one brand of liquid paracetamol – but the sweet, viscous, strawberry-flavoured syrup in the purple box is as much a part of childcare as nappies, wipes, dummies and bottles. Babies learn to recognise that syringe well before they know how to use a spoon, and they anticipate it: their sticky fingers reach to put it further into their mouths.This drug is found in found in bedrooms, bathrooms, nurseries and creches. Kitchen drawers across the country are littered with used Calpol syringes. There are more than 12,000 search results for Calpol on the talkboards of the British parenting website Mumsnet. But the more Calpol has become synonymous with parenting, the more its ubiquity has begun to worry us.Over the past decade or so there has been a succession of panics over Calpol. Could it be behind the explosion in childhood asthma? Could its signature colourings and flavourings be the mysterious cause of the epidemic of ADHD? Worries over Calpol’s purported sedative properties have filled the pages of countless parenting forums.Last year, a BBC documentary about overmedicated children set off another flurry of panic. After reporting that children swallow three times as many drugs as they did 40 years ago, the film-makers interviewed a family GP whose brief remarks filled the pages of tabloids and the sofas of daytime TV for the better part of a week. “We have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol,” the GP said. “Some people describe it as the heroin of childhood.”Like all paracetamol products, Calpol eases pain and lowers fever, but we give it to babies who are too young to tell us what is wrong with them in the hope it will soothe them. For many, Calpol is a panacea, a cure for baby-crying, a reliable way to settle your child and send them off to sleep. At a time when we are being forced to recognise the dangers of so many everyday items, from plastics to bacon to toilet seats, we fear that the ubiquitous solution in the brown glass bottle must have some kind of dark side. In short, Calpol makes us feel guilty. It has become a soft target for an anxiety exploited by scaremongers and conspiracy theorists. But British parents cannot live without it.The medicine of British childhood is actually produced in a vast factory in a suburb of Orléans. Calpol is now owned by an American company, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson, who have outsourced manufacturing to a French company called Famar. In their marketing, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson like to remind us of how Calpol has been a go-to solution for generations of British parents, but the company only acquired the brand in 2006, and don’t have much information about its history. They have never given an interview about Calpol before: pharmaceutical companies don’t really do press junkets.After several months of emails about Calpol, they invited me to their British headquarters in Maidenhead, where the receptionists wear the company colours – white shirts with red neckerchiefs – as if they were stewardesses on a Johnson \u0026amp Johnson airline.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson call the Calpol range of medicines The Calpol Family. “From stuffy noses and sore throats to aches and pains, fevers and teething,” the brand’s website promises, “we’ve carefully developed a family of effective medicines to help you take great care of your little one” – as if describing a crack team of solutions to almost any health problem the average child will encounter.“It’s a brand that we’re really proud of,” Purvi Farahi, the head of marketing for Northern Europe told me. She sat with Gill Nelson, the medical director for Northern Europe, in a white boardroom with red chairs on the other side of the table was a PR consultant who was taking notes and recording every word of our conversation. “For over 50 years, it’s a brand that parents, grandparents and caregivers have grown up with. At the heart of it, I think it’s really about trust.”Trust in the Calpol brand is the reason people choose it over cheaper alternatives: parents are buying “the experience of the overall product”, Nelson told me. “When you’ve got a poorly child and you really want to make them feel better, it’s not really a time when you want to start browsing the shelves.”Dr Andrew Green, a GP in Yorkshire and the British Medical Association’s GP committee clinical and prescribing lead, took a dimmer view of our collective loyalty to the Calpol brand: “In our society we have the idea that expensive things are best,” he told me after my trip to Maidenhead. “Buying the expensive one that’s the familiar one with the nice bottle and the advertising means parents are doing the best for their child.”Calpol’s formula is as central to its success as its familiarity. “The active ingredient is paracetamol, but the other ingredients – what we call the excipients of the product, all the other bits and pieces that are put in to make sure it doesn’t go off in the bottle, has the right consistency, can be extruded into a syringe for dosing, tastes acceptable and looks acceptable to children – all those are unique to Calpol,” Nelson explained, deftly avoiding the words “colouring”, “preservatives”, “flavourings” and “sweeteners”. Calpol has 2.2g of sucrose per 5ml, which is more than four times as much sugar as there is in an equivalent amount of Coca-Cola. No wonder children can’t get enough of it.Prof Mahendra Patel, a pharmacist and board member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told me that Calpol’s tasty formula has made all medicines more palatable for children. “Calpol educates that baby to say, actually, I will have that medicine, I won’t spit it out. In terms of any medication the child takes thereafter, the seed has been sown that medicines aren’t bad.”You don’t have to go to a pharmacy to buy Calpol: it’s sold in petrol stations, newsagents, corner shops and supermarkets. If you can get a pint of milk, you can probably buy a bottle of Calpol alongside it. “Availability is really important, particularly for a medicine of this type where it often is a purchase that you’re making in a really stressful situation,” Nelson said. This doesn’t quite ring true to me: I have never waited until my children were ill before buying some. Indeed, the NHS website says it’s “a good idea” to keep children’s paracetamol always stored at home.Patel has witnessed the power of the brand first-hand. He began his career working in areas that were densely populated with recent migrants from Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. “Families with small children were coming through the pharmacy and they didn’t speak the language, but because Calpol was Calpol it didn’t need any translation: they knew it was the solution to many of their children’s minor problems.”The nurses who run immunisation clinics routinely tell parents to give their babies paracetamol to avoid adverse reactions, particularly after the meningitis B vaccination, which has a more powerful inflammatory response, was recommended for all infants in 2015. When my baby was immunised last year, the nurse explicitly told me to “go and buy some Calpol” to give her afterwards. This means many first-time parents’ first encounter with children’s medicine is a healthcare professional telling them to use it before their child is ill, setting up a relationship whereby we give it before we’re sure it’s needed.Under the watchful eye of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Calpol has managed to produce marketing messages that promise what every parent wants to hear. One recent advertising slogan is “Lets Kids be Kids”, and TV adverts emphasise how Calpol can “help them get back to normal”. A Calpol booklet offering an immunisation guide for parents depicts a blissed-out baby asleep with her arms outstretched and a smile on her face. Sick children don’t have a role to play in Calpol’s marketing strategy: the messages emphasise the emotional rather than medical reasons for giving the medicine. By focusing on the positives, they give the impression that Calpol can cure your child’s discomfort, no matter what the reason for it might be.When I put this to Farahi, she told me this was intentional. “The strategy for us is always to show the end benefit that parents are looking for,” she said. But their marketing strategy is about more than being back to normal: it’s about portraying children who have had Calpol as being happy, or asleep, or both.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson hold competitions every few years to find the new face of Calpol – a coveted role in marketing and packaging, on par with being the Pears or Gerber baby. More than 24,000 parents entered their children into a “Be a Calpol Star” competition on the brand’s Facebook page in 2011. When two year-old Millie Foster became “the Calpol Kid” in 2006, which meant her face appearing on the box, her mother, Georgina, was ecstatic. “Everyone will have her in their cupboards now. Her granny and grandpa are very proud,” Georgina told her local paper, the Surrey Comet, but added that Millie actually “doesn’t like her photo being taken at all”.In the 18th and 19th centuries, mothers rubbed paregoric – a waxy tincture containing opium – into their babies’ gums to soothe teething pain. As late as the mid-20th century, it was common to do the same with whisky or brandy, and “gripe water” containing alcohol, sugar, dill extract and baking soda was given routinely for colic. In the 1950s Gould’s gripe water was advertised with strapline “No more fuss from baby”.Even though paracetamol is the most common medicine in paediatrics, no one is entirely sure how it works. We know it inhibits an enzyme involved in producing prostaglandins, making the body less aware of pain, but the mechanism by which it acts on the brain to reduce fever is less understood. We know the inputs and the outputs, but it’s a black box.Paracetamol was discovered after a mistake at the University of Strasburg in the 1880s. Professor Adolf Kussmaul was experimenting with naphthalene, the main ingredient of mothballs, as a possible cure for intestinal parasites. His patients were accidentally given acetanilide instead, and while it wasn’t much good for worms, it dramatically lowered fever. Acetanilide was cheap and effective, but it also deactivated some of the haemoglobin in red blood cells, with potentially lethal results. Paracetamol, a derivate of acetanilide, was first used in clinical trials by the German pharmacologist Joseph von Mering in 1893, but fears lingered that it might still be dangerous, and it was only after a series of studies in the 1940s showed paracetamol to have no effect on haemoglobin that it began to be widely sold.Calpol was launched in 1959 by Calmic Limited, based in Crewe. (It’s likely the Calpol brand name comes from the contraction of “Calmic” and “paracetamol”.) At the time, paracetamol was being given to children in solution and tasted extremely bitter Calmic was the first to suspend it in a sweet, flavoured syrup. When Calmic was bought by Wellcome in 1966, aspirin was going out of fashion as a painkiller because it had been linked to gastro-intestinal bleeding. Wellcome marketed Calpol as “Better and safer than aspirin because it is a non-irritant”. It was prescription-only at this point, but prescription medicines could be legally advertised until 1978. One of the first print adverts for Calpol reads: “Calpol Suspension is a flavoured liquid – very pleasant to take from a spoon. As you know, this can be a great help when your child is ill or upset.” It sold parents calmness, just as it does today.Calpol’s advertising slogans of the mid-70s (“Simple answers to everyday babycare problems”, “Gentle and comforting, pleasant tasting too”) positioned it as more than a medicine: a comfort for your child, a solution for you. One late-70s slogan, “Pleasant for baby, peaceful for you”, is the closest the brand has ever come to explicitly claiming Calpol has the ability to make crying babies shut up. The sentiment was echoed in an animated television advert in the 1980s featuring a grumpy, grizzly baby. “There are times when every baby is just crying out for Calpol infant suspension,” the mellow voiceover says, as the child’s frazzled parents stand over his cot in their pyjamas pouring it into a spoon. “It makes everyone feel better.”By the 1980s, Calpol could be bought from pharmacies without a prescription, and it became one of Wellcome’s best-selling products in the UK, with more than a million bottles sold over the counter in 1983. Babies began to be given Calpol routinely after vaccinations. Calpol was now such a normal part of British parenting that it was being marketed as something you pack in your suitcase when you go abroad. “When the family go on holiday don’t take the risk of aches and pains,” read a 1980s print advert, next to a cartoon of a feverish child on a beach. Discomfort had become something a “concerned parent” shouldn’t want to risk.When British parents began to worry about sugar and additives, sugar-free Calpol was launched in 1988, and a colour-free version arrived a few years later. When we became obsessed with 24-hour convenience in the late 1990s, Calpol switched from being a pharmacy-only medicine to one sold in any store. Since acquiring the brand in 2006, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson have expanded the Calpol “family”, launching a version that was both sugar-free and colour-free in 2011, and adding a saline nasal spray and a plug-in vapouriser that releases chamomile and lavender essential oils supposed to assist sleep after all, this is a brand that parents have long associated with sleeping children.The link between Calpol and sleep has been discussed in countless Mumsnet threads since the site launched in 2000. In one entitled “Dosed on Calpol – feeling guilty”, a mother tortures herself for giving her six-month-old a dose purely to make him drop off. Other parents weigh in to reassure her. “Calpol wont send him to sleep. he was obviously in discomfort with paintemp somewhere, and the calpol worked,” one says. “I just assumed that it was slightly sedative,” the mother replies. “I guess you can’t use it forever though so where do you draw the line?”In 2007 Johnson \u0026amp Johnson introduced a new product: Calpol Night, for children aged two years and up, with added antihistamine, to explicitly aid sleep. But in 2009 the MHRA ruled that 36 different medicines, including Calpol Night, should no longer be given to children under six: research had shown them to be of limited use in younger children, and linked them to side effects such as disturbed sleep and hallucinations. Even though Johnson \u0026amp Johnson could have continued to market it for older children, Calpol Night was quietly withdrawn in 2010.Doing the very best for your children today means not ever allowing them to suffer. But the generation of parents who are increasingly unwilling to leave their children to cry at night are the same parents who are prepared to dose them up with a nightcap of paracetamol and antihistamines to make them sleep.Prescriptions for ADHD medication have doubled in the past decade, and prescriptions of adult sleep medication given to children have increased tenfold over the same period. But because Calpol is such a ubiquitous part of everyday parenting, every anxiety over children’s medicines seems to be projected on to Calpol.The fame of Calpol is so great that it was even dragged into the investigation of Madeleine McCann’s disappearance in 2007. The Portuguese police were under pressure to come up with new leads, and their attention briefly turned to whether Madeleine’s parents, who were doctors, had accidentally killed her while trying to sedate her. Leaks from the investigation appeared in a Portuguese newspaper, claiming an oral dosing syringe had been found in their holiday apartment. The McCanns readily admitted that they occasionally gave their children Calpol, but strongly denied administering anything stronger. There was no basis whatsoever for the theory, which has been completely discredited. But still the Calpol detail was seized on by conspiracy theorists and tabloids alike: the combination of the nation’s most famous missing child and our best-loved children’s medicine was too sensational to resist, even though the most basic research would show that Calpol contains no sedative ingredients at all.Many of the subsequent panics have been similarly fact-free. “Babies given Calpol just once a month ‘are five times as likely to develop asthma’” declared a headline in the Daily Mail in 2013. The Mail was only one of many newspapers to dramatically misreport the results of a study of 20,000 Spanish children: Calpol isn’t even sold in Spain the study measured paracetamol use alongside asthma symptoms, but failed to find a causal link. The NHS issued a response debunking the reports, but the story still gets repeated in newspapers today.When a campaign group called later that year for food colourings linked to hyperactivity to be removed from children’s medicines – all children’s medicines – the press brought up Calpol’s signature purple hue: the headline in the Times read “Hyperactivity link to additives in Calpol”. Johnson \u0026amp Johnson said in an email that they use colourants – including “Sunset Yellow” and “Carmoisine”, which were linked to hyperactivity, though only with much higher doses than are found in Calpol – “to make the medicine look more visually appealing to poorly children who otherwise might refuse the dose”, adding that “the majority of children will experience no ill effects from consuming the tiny amounts of colourants in Calpol”. Of course, you could just buy the colour-free version – but the original purple formula remains the best-seller.But it was the GP’s offhand remark about Calpol as the “heroin of childhood” that caused the greatest flurry in the British tabloids. In 2018, a BBC series called The Doctor Who Gave Up Drugs looked into whether we are overmedicating our children. The presenter, Dr Chris Van Tulleken, took his baby daughter to be vaccinated and then interviewed his family GP. “We have children now who are almost addicted to paracetamol, to Calpol. I don’t think they are addicted to the drug itself, but they are addicted to the process,” the GP said. “Some people describe it as the heroin of childhood.”The image of the Calpol-junkie baby was too powerful to leave room for nuance. Parents left angry messages on Calpol’s Facebook page after the broadcast. “My children are teenagers now but I’ve learned things tonight that I never questioned before – I feel like I’ve been misinformed during their formative years,” said one. “Anybody working for this organisation needs to have more integrity,” said another, “speaking as a concerned mum.”But Chris Steele, doctor-in-residence on ITV’s This Morning programme, issued a robust defence of the brand on air. “Every parent will be thankful for the paracetamol Calpol syrup,” he said. “It’s not addictive. However, parents, I think, are psychologically dependent on Calpol, because when their children are ill they do go for the Calpol. Well, that’s all right, so long as you follow the recommended dosage. It’s totally safe.”Calpol is very safe if given according to the instructions on the pack. (The only real danger is an accidental overdose, and these are very rare.) But our dependence on it makes us uneasy, which is why the scare stories refuse to die. As both scaremongers and marketing departments know, parental concern is a lucrative seam to mine.Johnson \u0026amp Johnson reject the idea that parents are giving their children too much Calpol. “We don’t have any evidence that it’s overused,” Nelson said, and Farahi cited independent research data to back this up: “On average, households purchase 1.95, so say around two bottles a year of Calpol,” she told me. “Usually there’s about 1.75 kids in a family, roughly two.” One bottle per child per year doesn’t sound like much, but an average figure takes in families of children of all ages, and, as any parent knows, Calpol is used more frequently with babies than with older kids.As much as paracetamol is a black box, so are babies: they are non-verbal, their internal states are opaque, and we have to work out what’s wrong with them when they are upset. “There seems to be a default action to give it to a distressed child, whether or not that child has a temperature or fever,” Dr Andrew Green told me. This happens at the other end of the age spectrum, he said. “Where you have an adult with dementia who is distressed, then it’s a quite reasonable therapeutic intervention to try some regular low-risk medication like paracetamol, because sometimes people can’t communicate pain. I wouldn’t in any way criticise parents for giving it to distressed children. There are rational reasons for doing it.”Calpol’s packaging says it is for the relief of pain and fever, but we give it for distress, and the brand has always encouraged this in its marketing. There are many reasons why a drug containing no known sedatives might make a child calm and sleepy. The most obvious is that it alleviates the pain or physical discomfort from fever that was preventing them from sleeping. But it is likely Calpol’s power derives primarily from its ability to comfort parents.“One of the things that determines the distress in the child is the distress in the parent. Children and babies are extremely good at picking up anxiety,” Green told me, describing how babies at immunisation clinics are always more upset by the injection when their parents are fretting. “It’s upsetting for parents to have an ill child, and natural for parents to want to help that ill child. Giving the child medicine is a way of helping. The act of giving the Calpol assumes far more importance than the mere giving of a medicine: it’s an expression of love, and it reduces tension. It’s almost a placebo effect by proxy: the child benefits from the parent believing that they’re doing good.”We are dependent on Calpol – but it is parents, not kids, who are addicted. It is understandable that a medicine could come to take such a central role in family life. Parents are increasingly atomised, separated from wider networks of extended families and community that used to pass wisdom down. When there is a problem with our children, we are as likely to reach for Google as to ask a friend. Calpol has stepped into that void, producing booklet guides to immunisations, and online advice on teething, earache, colds, flu and many more common minor health problems. The Calpol website hosts several information videos featuring groups of mums sharing a pot of tea with a GP around a wooden kitchen island, comparing notes about how to recognise a fever, the flu or a new tooth. The site gets over more than a million hits a year.But by turning to Calpol whenever our child is distressed, we contribute to an already rampant culture where problems are supposed to be solved by medication. “We can forget, in all stages of our lives, the non-drug interventions that are effective, the simple things that we can do,” Green said. “Every time a GP does an emergency or a turn-up-on-the-day type of surgery, we will get an embarrassed mum in with a child who is running around the room giggling. They will say, ‘I brought him here because he’s really ill with a temperature, but he’s got better.’ The reason they’ve got better is that they are in an environment that is interesting, and they’ve had a ride in the car or bus or pushchair and cooled off a little bit.”Johnson \u0026amp Johnson insist the wider Calpol range, with its nasal spray and vapour plug, offers non-drug alternatives for those who want them. But perhaps it would be more useful to look at this the other way round: it’s not so much that we believe the answer to our children’s discomfort is drugs, but that we don’t view Calpol as a drug. It has infiltrated our daily lives and most protected spaces. It is part of solving our babies’ problems in the same way as a dummy, a cuddle or a nappy change is. Many are as likely to reach for Calpol as they are to rock their babies when they are very upset.Some of this is due to clever marketing, which, over decades, has established the brand as a “simple answer”, an “everyday” part of having kids. Some of this comes from its ubiquity – the fact that it can be bought at the same time as we buy our loaf of bread or fill the car up with petrol. Calpol has become the brand of medicine that we don’t regard as a drug, no matter what its manufacturers might print on the pack. That is the secret of its success.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd95d53d2b2909eccd912fa1f021c2a498aaa243/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45c0e7ca82424acd5f605bbdf52f2d2c","title":"best albums of 2019 so far","story":"Ariana Grande delivered swaggering pop, there was state-of-the-nation rap from Slowthai, Dave and Sleaford Mods, Billie Eilish shouted out for the teens, and Angélique Kidjo blended Africa with Cubaby  Ben Beaumont-Thomas and  Laura SnapesAnchored by sturdy, stunningly pretty folk-rock backings, Adrianne Lenker, her voice tremulous but tenacious, makes existential musings amid verdant nature.What we said: “Full of subtle charm, it’s an album of deceptive depths in which to immerse yourself.” Read the full reviewThe Californian troubadour, who has steadily wound his way through the fringes of Americana and indie for over 15 years, delivers another romantic, faintly psychedelic masterpiece.What we said: “McCombs rewards deep listening.

The MPs are holding a meeting on Tuesday lunchtime and an announcement is expected later in the day.Umunna conceded last week that the party had “made mistakes along the way”, and suggested pro-remain parties should “work together instead of competing”.However, the  understands a core of five Change UK MPs – out of the party’s 11 – including the former Labour MPs Joan Ryan, Chris Leslie, Mike Gapes and Ann Coffey, and the former Conservative MP Anna Soubry, are determined to continue as a separate party.One party source insisted Change UK would go on to field candidates at the next general election and said the group had been working on a policy platform.Change UK, which was initially called the Independent Group, caused a stir in Westminster when it was launched four months ago, with the defection of seven Labour MPs. It had hoped to become the catalyst for a major political realignment, attracting a string of other recruits and becoming the rallying point for remainers.High-profile candidates including the former Conservative minister Stephen Dorrell, and the journalists Rachel Johnson and Gavin Esler, joined the party’s list of MEP candidates.But it has been beset by internal disagreements over both strategy and management, including how closely to cooperate with other parties. Change UK’s leading candidate to become an MEP in Scotland, David MacDonald, stepped aside from the race and recommended voting for the Lib Dems. Two other candidates resigned after offensive social media posts were uncovered.Shortly after the party forms, former Labour MP Angela Smith is heavily criticised for referring to people from minority backgrounds as having a funny tingeAfter renaming itself Change UK, the party gets into a row with petition site Change.org, who release a statement warning it will be seeking guidance over the imitation of its brandTwo election candidates are forced to resign within 24 hours of each other after offensive tweets emerge, including Joseph Russo, the party\u0027s top Scotland candidate, writing \u0027black women scare me\u0027Lead Scottish candidate defects to the Lib Dems a week before European electionsMP Joan Ryan implores the audience at the party\u0027s Bath rally to look at their palms: \u0027It\u0027s there, the future is in your hands\u0027In the week before the European Parliamentary elections it emerges that Change UK have become the biggest single political advertiser on Facebook - including spending at least £1,300 promoting Facebook adverts saying it was campaigning to \u0027remain in the UK\u0027Allen, the South Cambridgeshire MP, was appointed interim leader, but Umunna was still widely regarded as Change UK’s public face. Allen admitted she had considered resigning in the run-up to the European elections. She had suggested voting tactically for the Lib Dems in that poll, a proposal Soubry later called “rather bizarre”.With Cable stepping aside, both frontrunners for the Lib Dem leadership have suggested they would welcome new recruits, either from Change UK or Labour. Jo Swinson said: “We are now the obvious place for remain supporters to coalesce. I would encourage anyone who shares our liberal values in or outside parliament to join our party and join our liberal movement.

He has been\u0026nbsprelatively quiet recently, beyond his regular  column, but this is very deliberate.The former House of Commons leader, who left Theresa May as the last candidate standing when she pulled out of the\u0026nbspprevious leadership race\u0026nbspin 2016, has decided to have another tilt at the top job, saying she has the “experience and confidence” to “lead this country into a brighter future”. But even with her staunch Brexiter tendencies, she would be seen as an outsider.The housing minister is credited as the convener of both Conservative leavers and remainers to develop a compromise on May’s withdrawal agreement. He said there was a “yearning for change”. The 52-year-old is a former deputy mayor of London and entered the Commons in 2015 when David Cameron’s\u0026nbspConservatives\u0026nbspwon a majority. His name was given to the\u0026nbsp“Malthouse\u0026nbspcompromise”\u0026nbsp– a proposal drawn up by backbenchers from leave and remain wings of the Tory party, which would have implemented May’s Brexit deal with the backstop replaced by alternative arrangements.The former work and pensions secretary, who\u0026nbspquit last year\u0026nbspover May’s Brexit plans, has\u0026nbsplaunched her own\u0026nbspin-party campaign groupleadership vehicle called Blue Collar Conservatism, promising to make the party more amenable to voters in deprived communities – mainly through a promise to deliver a strong Brexit and policies such as erting much of the foreign aid budget to schools and police.Few things say “would-be leader in waiting” like a kitchen photoshoot with your spouse, and the former Brexit secretary duly obliged\u0026nbspwith this imageawash with tasteful pastel hues. He formally launched his bid\u0026nbspin the Mail on Sunday. Among the more core constituency of Conservative MPs, Raab has been pushing hard, as has his semi-official\u0026nbsp“Ready for Raab”\u0026nbspTwitter feed.The cabinet’s most recent arrival – Mordaunt’s promotion to defence led to Stewart becoming international development secretary – certainly has the necessary\u0026nbspambition and self-belief, plus a privileged if unorthodox backstory covering Eton, Oxford, a senior role in postwar Iraq and a bestselling book about walking across Afghanistan. He remains an outsider, not least because of his remain tendencies and slightly 2010 view of compassionate Conservatism. He\u0027s become a social media darling and been endorsed by Ken Clarke, but his reputation as \u0027Florence of Belgravia\u0027 may hinder him.Sir Graham Brady, Penny Mordaunt and\u0026nbspJames Brokenshire are yet to declare their intentions.\u0026nbspLiz Truss and Amber Rudd have ruled themselves out.Among other senior figures not expected to run are Brandon Lewis, Chris Grayling and Philip Hammond. Gavin Williamson’s recent sacking after the Huawei leak inquiry will also surely rule him out as an option this time around.James Cleverly withdrew from the contest.Earlier on Tuesday, Liam Fox backed the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, to be the next Conservative leader, in a further splintering of cabinet endorsements in five different directions.The international trade secretary is the first cabinet member to support Hunt, who is one of the four frontrunners alongside Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and Dominic Raab.Fox, one of the cabinet’s most dedicated Brexiters, surprised some other leadership camps on Tuesday with his endorsement of Hunt, who has said pursuing no deal would be “political suicide” because it would lead to a general election.Fox said he was backing “my friend” Hunt, having previously mounted a defence of keeping a no-deal departure on the table. “If we can’t get an agreement, we have to be willing to walk away, otherwise we have no real negotiating hand,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.However, Fox said he was aware “the prospect of a no deal might well be used by those who seek to break up the UK, to use that as a weapon in that particular battle, both I think in Northern Ireland and potentially in Scotland”.Over the weekend, Johnson won the coveted endorsement of Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who had been touted to run herself, as well as that of the sacked former defence secretary Gavin Williamson.But on Tuesday, the security minister, Ben Wallace, declined to say he was supporting Johnson, whom he backed in 2016 and then jokingly threatened to inflict a Game of Thrones-style torture on Gove when he threw his hat in the ring and scuppered Johnson’s chances.“I haven’t made a decision yet,” Wallace told Today. “What we do need to do is make sure this race is about getting the right person to lead the country, but I’m not going to bang on about it.”A Conservative leadership contest has two stages.First, MPs vote for their choice from the nominated candidates. In each round of voting, the candidate with the least number of votes is eliminated from the contest. MPs vote again, until there are only two challengers remaining. This usually takes place over several days, and candidates often withdraw from the process if they see they have no chance of winning.The second stage is a postal ballot of Conservative party members to chose one of the two candidates, meaning around 120,000 people will choose the UK\u0027s next prime minister.Theresa May will formally resign on 7 June, and nominations to be leader are expected to close the following week. The contest should be finished by the end of July.Mel Stride, the new leader of the House of Commons, is a backer of Gove, while Sajid Javid, the home secretary, won the support of the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, on Tuesday.David Gauke, the justice secretary, who has repeatedly cautioned against a no-deal Brexit, has backed the outsider candidate Rory Stewart, formerly a junior minister in his department.Stewart, who has ruled out pursuing a no-deal Brexit, has attracted mass media attention for his campaign, which has been based on social media videos of him meeting the public at short-notice events around the country.Several high-profile cabinet names are yet to declare who they will back, including the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the work and pensions secretary, Amber Rudd, who has been one of the most vocal cabinet voices against leaving the EU without an agreement.Rudd’s 60-strong group of One Nation Conservative MPs will hold its first of three hustings on Tuesday night for Tory candidates.There are 12 declared candidates after Cleverly’s departure, but the list could grow. Supporters of the defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt, say she will make a decision about running after an evening conference call with grassroots activists.The 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, which will run the contest, is to hold an executive meeting on Tuesday as calls grow for changes to the rules to reduce the size of the field. Rules must then be agreed by the party board on Wednesday and the first round of voting is expected to take place the following Thursday.Several members of the committee favour new rules under which each candidate would need a proposer, a seconder and 10 supporters to make the ballot of MPs – a total of 12 endorsements.This would eliminate Stewart, Mark Harper, Esther McVey, Andrea Leadsom, Kit Malthouse and Sam Gyimah.Supporters of Johnson increasingly believe the race is likely to head for a “psychodrama” of a run-off between him and Gove. However, leadership teams behind Hunt, Raab, Javid and Hancock all believe they could come through the middle, with about 150 Conservative MPs still to declare who they are backing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/801c485849ef252e0a176d8b3065ab51cbb7a997/0_0_1995_1197/master/1995.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=075b65a96b1af5fe45b7da7ba767a6bf","title":"anxiety revolution kidnapping therapy secrets from across the world","story":"As part of the ’s new mental health series, psychiatrists and psychologists from around the globe talk about the view from the couchIllustrations by Alex HedworthEyecandyOye Gureje, professor of psychiatryBanditry, terrorism and kidnapping are on the rise in Nigeria, and life is not getting any less chaotic in our cities. These are factors that predispose mental health problems, and although we don’t have good survey data on this, we probably have more problems than other countries.We have 250 psychiatrists serving 200 million people. That’s barely one per million – an incredibly low number.For most Nigerians with common mental disorders like depression, anxiety, PTSD or some degree of substance-use disorder, the chances are that they will never get treatment.If they have the most severe mental disorders like psychosis, then most will end up with either a faith healer – usually Pentecostal or Islamic – or a traditional healer.They use herbs and apparently some of them are efficacious. They use rituals, sacrifices, prayer, fasting, holy oil and holy water, but also things that are potentially harmful, like shackling, beating, prolonged fasting and scarification.We found that in Ibadan, a fairly well resourced city of about 2.5 million people, we had about 90 places for admission for mental illness, whereas healers had just over 400 places. So irrespective of what we feel about what they’re doing, what we need to do is look at how we can improve the service they offer.Not acknowledging a mental health problem doesn’t stop it manifesting in other ways, and there seems to be a rising tide of suicides across the country. Whether there really is more suicide or whether it’s just considered more newsworthy at the moment, I don’t know.We can’t train hundreds more psychiatrists overnight. But the government needs to pay more attention, to improve policy and implement programmes, and they can do that with the resources already available. And we need to train up our primary care providers to recognise and treat common mental disorders. As told to Ruth MacleanBut thanks to the media and also a lot of popular films and books, psychotherapy is becoming more mainstream and less marginalised here. Especially among hipsters, the young creative class, it’s seen as a sign of caring for yourself. I work with highly motivated patients and have a long waiting list.That’s still a small slice of society. For many other Russians, psychotherapy is still a curiosity. Therapy is far more popular and available in big cities like Moscow than in more remote areas of Russia.I hear a lot of stories. One client told me she had been to a psychologist who started recommending books that she should start reading: classics like Tolstoy and Chekhov. The doctor said it would tell the story of her life and could serve as a model for how to behave. Obviously that doesn’t work.Antidepressants are becoming more popular and the growth in their use is somewhat chaotic. Since people don’t really trust psychiatrists, some prescribe themselves antidepressants. It’s not hard to get your hands on them via the internet.I’ve studied abroad in the west, and I don’t think that Russians require a different approach. But I do think Russians have got used to a harsher way of being treated by doctors. And then when you use a more humane approach, they immediately say, “Yes, that’s what I wanted.” As told to Andrew RothThere are still stigmas about mental health treatment in Egypt. One is that once you start treatment, it will open up a can of worms and you’ll never be able to get out of it. Another is that having treatment makes you weak, or “crazy”, in a way that could affect your work, or your chances of getting married. But these are lessening with time.The state of Egyptian mental health has changed a lot since I graduated in 2001. I don’t want to use the word better, but it’s certainly developing in terms of the training that practitioners and nurses get, for in-patient treatment.The main problem that I tend to treat is anxiety, and this is definitely increasing. There are several reasons for this. One is the 2011 revolution in Egypt and everything that came along with it, but also the invention of smartphones. Worldwide, the increasing use of technology and social media is definitely increasing their levels of anxiety.My observation is that there’s a clear generational ide in the patients I see. Younger patients tend to be more aware about therapies as a rule. While whether someone was pro-revolution or not doesn’t determine if they have anxiety, the younger pro-revolution generation that wanted to make a difference has been more focused on their mental health in the eight years since. There’s certainly a need and a demand for mental health services in Egypt. It’s not an easy place to live, especially right now with the country undergoing tough austerity measures. But there are a range of talking therapies on offer from CBT to existential therapy.There are public and private options. Still, it’s safe to say that I see the people who can afford to pay, and while sessions aren’t cheap I do operate on a sliding scale based on what people can afford. I think many providers do the same here.In the end, it’s not about how much money someone has. Sometimes I see wealthy people where their level of awareness about mental health is limited due to their upbringing and mentality, while someone with fewer means is more exposed because they’re online more, or they’re younger. As told to Ruth MichaelsonDr George Hu, chief of mental health, Shanghai United Family Pudong HospitalI see almost anyone and everyone, but more than half of my patients are children and adolescents. They most often present with anxiety, depression and suicidal behaviour, which can manifest as learning problems, attention and hyperactivity difficulties, and behavioural problems. These symptoms arise from a variety of sources, but they often come from a difficulty in their relationship with their parents. We have a lot of absent parents who have not been able to prioritise their relationship with their children.In China now we have a large middle class, as well as people who are very poor, and people who are very rich. What we’re seeing is that the two tails of the bell curve are coming closer together in terms of mental health difficulties. Obviously there are galactic differences in income and lifestyle, but whether you’re a CEO or a migrant worker, if you live apart from your children and only see them twice a month, it’s going to cause the same stress. In an effort to provide a lavish and advantageous lifestyle, the rich are inadvertently causing themselves many of the same problems as the poor.There’s definitely a change in attitudes to mental health, which used to be a taboo subject. The Chinese public system has rolled out resource access to 1.4 billion people in a way that’s unprecedented. Where there’s room for improvement is in access to psychotherapy as a valid mental healthcare treatment, in complement with psychiatry. It’s very much on the radar, but psychotherapy takes time and training, there are a lot of moving parts.I think technology will lead the way to increase access to psychotherapy. Attitudes to technology are much more open in China, and there are no old, established ways to push against. I’ve been able to establish a distance psychotherapy practice that would face significant hurdles in the US.There’s a lot of work to do, but we’re in an exciting place. As told to Andrew KilleenJuan Tenconi, former president of the Argentine Association of PsychiatristsArgentina far outranks any other country in the world with its number of psychologists. Here, we have 223 psychologists per 100,000 inhabitants, while second-ranking Netherlands clocks in at only 123, Germany 50 and the USA 30, according to the World Health Organization.This means that, if you are suffering from a mild neurosis, if you want to know yourself better or are seeking to improve yourself, you are in a fantastic situation in terms of mental healthcare.On the other hand, if you have a low income and a severe mental condition and are forced to rely on the public medical system you may find yourself in a problem, depending to a large extent on where you live.The public health system is overstretched and underfinanced. Some provinces have very good mental healthcare, but far from all of them. Public hospitals will often run out of psychiatric drugs, just the same as they run out of penicillin or medical gauze.One of the main problems is there are no separate wards for mental health patients, so someone with a case of schizophrenia can end up in the same room as a patient who’s just had a heart attack, with all the trauma this can cause both patients.So if you are living in a shanty town and have a severe condition you may end up interned in inadequate facilities. The problem could be compounded soon by the new national health law that foresees closing down the old psychiatric hospitals during 2020. This will throw a large number of patients out on the street: many of them will end up homeless.As told to Uki GoñiAlberto Pellai, psychotherapist and researcher, University of MilanMental illnesses are on the rise among Italians. The most common and widespread disorder is depression. However, despite Italy’s intermediate ranking among European countries, numbers do not reflect the true scope of the problem. Stats do not consider iniduals who continue to believe that seeking the help of a psychologist or psychiatrist is for “crazy” people. There is still an entrenched cultural prejudice in Italy toward psychotherapy and antidepressants, which are viewed as ineffective or only for people who have lost their mind.The use of antidepressants is rising too, as are mental illnesses among adolescents. Among teenagers and their European cohort social isolation syndrome is increasing. Their lives play out entirely in their bedrooms. They inhabit a virtual world, glued to their computer or mobile phone screens. This has led to a growing challenge for young people to socialise.… Those suffering from less grave disturbances, such as attention deficit disorders or hyperactivity, risk bypassing others with serious signs of depression. The risk is that someone with suicidal tendencies goes from thought to action before receiving psychotherapeutic help in a public facility.

But she also wanted to show why walking in our cities is important for our well-beingWhen we talk about hiking, we typically think about escaping urban confines and exploring land less touched by humanity. We envision walking through lush landscapes, or scaling mountains that overlook miles of unspoiled terrain. But Liz Thomas, who held the speed record for the Appalachian Trail for five years, and has explored the world on foot, has evolved her approach to hiking over the years.“I completed my first urban hike in Los Angeles in 2013 and since then, my view of what hiking is has changed,” Thomas tells the . “It sparked something in me in how I thought about being active, how I thought about the urban landscape, and how I thought about how people interact with nature and their bodies.”Now dubbed the “Queen of Urban Hiking”, Thomas has since made her way through through San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, Portland and Pittsburgh. There was one urban territory she had yet to conquer though: New York City.Hiking through New York was always on Thomas’ to-do list, but it wasn’t until the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit that helps create parks and protect land, reached out to and asked her if she wanted to participate in a urban hike that she took action.Carter Strickland, the New York and New Jersey Director for TPL, saw Thomas speaking at a conference and learned of her previous hikes. “I realized that it was a great fit and we had the scale of on-the-ground programs in New York that might lend itself to urban hikes,” Strickland says.Within six months, he and Thomas organized a hike and last month Thomas logged more than 225 miles over nine days. “For New Yorkers, they are used to walking,” Strickland says, “but perhaps they don’t view hiking as a possibility within their own city. We’re hoping with Thomas’ urban hike, we’re able to show city dwellers that it’s possible to explore your own city and experience a little bit of nature without having to venture two hours outside of the city.”The other aim of the hike was to bring awareness to how many New Yorkers don’t have a park within a 10-minute walk from their home. “One thing I learned on my urban hike in New York is that certain neighborhoods have great access, while other neighborhoods don’t. These playgrounds really play an important function in certain neighborhoods, so providing a park in places where there is otherwise a longer walk to a park is an important part of why I partnered with TPL,” Thomas says.Strickland believes that parks help foster a sense of community that otherwise is hard to nurture. “It’s good for the environment because it provides shade and rainwater and can provide coastal resilience. But it’s also good for mental and physical health, more importantly and it’s good for creating communities where rich, poor, black and white congregate.”One thing Thomas has learned through urban hiking is how people’s fear of nature can stop them enjoying the outdoors. Walking in the city helps open the door for them to explore their surroundings. “No, it’s not the same as going out into the woods, but it can be equally cathartic,” she says. “And it’s actually more fun in a different way.”Instead of carting around a tent, Thomas stayed in various Airbnbs throughout the city, and had the chance to explore the city’s restaurants instead of eating camp food. “You become more connected to your surrounding environment when you walk around without a real destination in mind,” Thomas says. “The beauty with urban hiking is, if you decide you’re done, you can stop whenever you want. And with places like New York where public transportation is so accessible, you can hop on a train or bus and head back home when you want.”Meanwhile, Thomas says interest goes beyond the States. “I recently had someone message me on Instagram from Melbourne, Australia, who said, ‘You know, this is really inspiring me to hike my own city.’ And that feels really good to know that my message is resonating with others in different parts of the world.”As for her next urban hike, her destination is up in the air. However, the mission will remain the same. “Obviously it’s fun for me but I also I think there’s just so much to learn from experiencing a landscape like going to neighborhoods in your city that you would never normally go to, and experiencing it by foot,” Thomas says. “You also get an idea of what’s it like to live in this as a kid who walks to school in this neighborhood, to be a grandparent who lives across from this park in this neighborhood, and it’s just something you don’t get in that sort of fly by experience that you would have in a car.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae439ca3d5f7f34f30b429f0365b67667598ba84/84_0_4133_2480/master/4133.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0725c578270c5eb9b1dc02a506c0c441","title":"cricket world cup 2019 afghanistan v sri lanka live","story":"No news from Cardiff, which in this case is bad news. If you want some actual cricket, Tanya Aldred is in cracking form over on our county cricket blog.Twenty-five years ago this Thursday, Paj Defreitas took a five-for as England beat New Zealand by an innings in the first Test at Trent Bridge. Oh, and Brian Lara scored 501 not out. ‘I don’t know a Mr Kohli. Virat, please’Thanks Tom, hello everyone. This isn’t looking too good, I’m afraid. We’re about to start losing overs, and some forecasts suggest we’ll lose the lot of them. That would be pretty cruel on Afghanistan, who were well on the way to the biggest victory in their short but life-affirming history.Turns out Abhijato’s unleashed quite the conversational beast with his scorecard musings. Here’s a couple more: “Scorecards are essentially records of what each inidual did,” says Graham O’Reilly. “There’s very little on the team, apart from fall of wickets, and in ODIs you need more than that. The key info throughout the match in the team run-rate. True, you can get an idea from the fall of wickets, but if no-one’s out, the scorecard leaves you completely in the dark. You get it only on the OBO. Surely it can’t be too hard to work it into the scorecard.”And Tom Wein quips: “I think annotated scorecards would be particularly enjoyable at less professional levels of the game. The occasional scrawled ‘Bloody hell, what’s he gone and poked at that one for?’ would bring a lot of joy to later readers.” Club cricket scorecards should also record who made the tea, what was in the tea, fines for dropped catches and jugs of beer bought by five-wickethalf-century heroes.And on that bombshell, I shall hand over to Rob Smyth, in the hope he’ll have some cricket to describe that was as fun as what we saw earlier. So he’ll have to clean up the conversational mess all this scorecard-nerdery has generated, while I do a David Cameron and swan off to let my successor mop up the chaos. Email him hereThanks for your company. ByeRight, and here’s World Stareout’s Paul Hatcher with that email you’ve all been waiting for:Neil Ashby (1:13pm) has made the gravest of errors . He’s quite correct that the stare-out was a concoction of my brain but I’m a NORTHAMPTONSHIRE cricket season ticket holder not Nottinghamshire! Neil, go and stand in the corner and think about what you’ve done.“If I may give an even more ‘on the spot’ weather update than your dad round the corner,” boasts Katie Allen, “I work quide liderally next door to Sophia Gardens and we have uniformly slate grey skies and it’s absolutely sheeting it down. I can’t see it stopping any time soon, which is a huge shame for both teams, their fans, and also myself as I have a race for my running club this evening.”The rain is now pretty heavy over Sofia Gardens, so we’re almost certainly looking at a reduced match. Because life just isn’t fair sometimes.So let’s have some more red-hot scorecard chat, courtesy of Tone White:“I find the suggestion of an appendix to a scorecard interesting. I don’t know if times have changed but x-ray results were sent to one’s doctor when I was last in GB. Here in France one collects the result oneself then trots along to the doctor to discuss. The ‘radiograph’ is always accompanied with a doctor’s assessment, an expert opinion to accompany the digits.Kinda useful! Quand même. I think cricket scorebooks are AT LEAST as important!”Still no joy, weather-wise, from Cardiff, with Sri Lanka 182-8 after 33 overs.In other pressing matters, World Stareout Championships guru Paul Hatcher has actually been in touch, only for his email to go missing from my inbox, which is down to either my incompetence, some technical glitch or other or a full tinfoil-hatted hacker conspiracy. So if you want to mail in again Paul, please do.In the meantime, our essential weekly email The Spin is in, with Ali Martin recalling Brian Lara’s 501 for Warwickshire, which, scarily is a whole quarter of a century in the past now:Abhijato Sensarma and I aren’t the only two people in the entire world who want to chat scorecard-annotations. Matt Scott and Huw Swanborough are joining the party (and what a party!)“Re. scorecard annotations,” says Matt, “in my youth I did a lot of scoring, and used to love piecing together the story of old recorded matches through the basics alone. Abhijato’s example would have revealed itself to me deliciously like a golden ticket in a Wonka bar.”While Huw adds: “I don’t think scorecards are as barren and cold as you both suggest. A quick glance during a game in progress can often communicate a good sense of the game far more than most other sports. In particular, the fall of wicket and who took wickets can give you so much information as to how the game swung and changed, looking at this game and that middle order implosion we instantly get a good feel of the change of the game. I can’t think of another sport scorecard-esque thing that gives you such a good glance at how the game unfolded over time.“I would like to see maybe a slightly more digestible ‘how out’, perhaps listing where they were caught at least – Caught at cover and caught at slip are very different pieces of information. But otherwise, I think you are both a little harsh on the humble scorecard.“For more niche situations – like digested results in a wisden like format – an annotated scorecard sounds very interesting and appealing… Though I can’t help think it also sounds like a school report card.”While we wait for the weather to be nice to us, why not join Tanya Aldred for some county cricket latest, including the news that May 2018’s Dom Bess is closing on a hundred for Yorkshire against Essex and Lancashire are in a strong position against Leicestershire:The prolific Abhijato Sensarma emails on a subject of genuine fascination:Ever since the dawn of professional cricket, the scorecard has been said to be say only ‘half the story’. The minutes batted column, the last saving grace of first-class matches, are slowly disappearing too. Can it not be that annotations are used for cricketing scorecards?Of course, the official version can remain as it is, but when one looks at such features digitally, especially considering the match reports are sometimes not available, or not telling us the complete story of gripping encounters, annotations can make the scorecard more user friendly.The Ranji Trophy in India is a prime example - no organisation wants to commission a dull match report for every game in a season, but there is enough quality cricket in them for the stand-out performers to be remembered and honoured. An Ashok Dinda 12* from number eleven might not catch many eyeballs when people look at the records years later, but the line stating “His stoic innings allowed the centurion batsman to form an important partnership with him to get the team into the first-innings lead” will inform the people of his contribution’s importance.The element of subjective essential will remain there, of course, but most of the time an edge-filled innings will be called out for what it was while a Kohli ODI masterclass can be anointed as the greatest of all time. Scorecard writers may as well develop an own style of theirs and become important, like OBO and BBB writers are nowadays after the advent of the internet.A sentence can be enough to address each inidual performance for an innings (bowling and batting) in such a scorecard, while the best of the lot can be offered more space, along with a a chance for the ‘scorecard writer’ to use his own style of writing, dry sense of humour, or simple poetic appreciation.In an age full of new fans and people who might not appreciate the beauty of numbers alone, such additions can be an exciting addition to scorecards, which have so far been a purely statistical and rather dry aspect of this beautiful game.I’m not sure I agree. I kind of love the way the scorecard’s cold, hard rendering of facts acts as a kind of yin to the yang of the real-time emotion the game can generate. That, say, Edgbaston 2005 is only in Wisden or Playfair as an ordered collection of names and numbers, saying so much by saying so little, somehow. My sense of equilibrium was slightly put out even when papers started included a line about how batsmen were dismissed in their scorecards. But then I’m deeply weird. Any other burning views on this essential subject?Sky is showing Afghanistan v Australia highlights at the moment, so I can’t bring you any red-hot weather updates, other than the intelligence that the weather’s far from red hot, though my dear old Dad - who lives literally round the corner from the ground - informs me that it’s raining in their back garden (and presumably the front one too). Good news for the plants anyhow.Meanwhile, Jeremy Peters is officially smitten by Afghanistan:“Hi Tom. I may have finally gone full Blue Tiger. I have tickets for the Afghanistan games against India and Pakistan. We targeted those back in September when we were all abuzz about Rashid, Nabi, Mujeeb and the team’s attractive dark horse quality. They can’t have peaked too early, can they? Surely I’ll see the same dramatics later in the month? At any rate, it demonstrates how wonderful cricket is, with such dominance in the first 20 overs undone by brilliance.”The forecast is pretty grim for the next couple of hours, I’m afraid. So here’s some contributions from you the public. Neil Ashby wants some credit due to world stare-out supremo Paul Hatcher: “Just like to give a quick shout out and mention to my pal Paul Hatcher, the creator of the world stare-out competition and a recently ‘convinced’ cricket fan (he was a Nottinghamshire season ticket holder last season for the first time, not sure if he’s renewed this year though).”And our regular liveblog Scotland correspondent Simon McMahon gets off the mark with this, on the subject of the small-nation-phobic World Cup format:“Preach on, brothers Swanborough and Davies (32nd over). I’m still not quite over the fact that I won’t be able to watch Scotland in this World Cup. Though to be honest, watching Scotland in any World Cup is a mixed blessing.”Luckily for you, you’ve got one starting this very week:Or rather, raining even harder, and the covers are on. The players are off. This could be a Duckworth-Lewis kind of day, which would be a crying shame given the remarkable game we’ve got on our hands.32nd over: Sri Lanka 182-8 (Lakmal 2, Malinga 0). A further massive blow for Sri Lanka as Perera is caught behind reverse sweeping to a fine ball by Khan, who’s now got two tailenders to torment, though he lets Malinga have two with a stray one down leg, which is flicked to fine leg (off his legs it would seem), though he’s very nearly run out but Shahzad can’t quite gather and complete cleanly.Fancy seeing that earlier Nabi over again? You should do.The biggie! Perera misjudges a sweep off Rashid Khan, didn’t have room for it, and gloves it into the hands of Shahzad behind the stumps. Sorry for jinxing him by saying he might carry his bat.32nd over: Sri Lanka 179-7 (K Perera 78, Lakmal 1). Dawlat returns to the attack as Gulbadin opts to hold back Nabi’s final over. Perera, his earlier strokeplay a distant memory, bottom-edges on the legside for a single. Udana wants to up the ante but if you’re going to swing at a straight accurate ball you need to connect - he doesn’t, and is clean bowled. They opt for drinks at this juncture, halfway through the over, which poor old Kusal Perera will need more than most. For the second match in succession, a Sri Lankan opener could end up carrying his bat, beached by the carelessness of his teammates.A slab of righteousness from Huw Swanborough, with which I heartily concur: “What a game this is already, add this to Bangladesh – SA, and Pakistan – England and it’s shaping up to be a quality world cup. But doesn’t this hammer home how short sighted the ICC are with this tournament format? Reducing the amount of “smaller teams” in the competition? When we let smaller teams play, they get better – Bangladesh and Afganistan prime examples. Madness to not foster that.”Udana swings and misses at a straight one from Dawlat. The stumps are clattered, the bails light up, as do Afghanistan faces.31st over: Sri Lanka 177-6 (K Perera 77, Udana 10). Sri Lanka can’t work these bowlers away at the moment – Rashid’s offering little that’s sloggable in either line or length, and Udana has to play out a maiden. At this stage of the innings, that’s testimony to the recovery Afghanistan have effected.But the rain’s looking more ominous.30th over: Sri Lanka 177-6 (K Perera 77, Udana 10). Nabi continues, and it’s as tight as you like, giving up only two singles. Alas, it appears to be raining. Please no.Meanwhile, more bad news for South Africa:29th over: Sri Lanka 175-6 (K Perera 76, Udana 9). Rashid Khan replaces Hamid at the Cathedral Road End. Udana squirts one away for a single, but slip is so, so in play for these Afghan spinners. Rashid offers the batsmen little, and they’re not taking any risks.28th over: Sri Lanka 173-6 (K Perera 75, Udana 8). At last someone takes Nabi on, Udana taking one step down the pitch, negating the spin, and creaming it high over long-off for six, the first of the match. It barely makes a dent in Nabi’s figures though – he has four for 28 from eight, and has a fighting chance of getting the first five-fer of the tournament.27th over: Sri Lanka 166-6 (K Perera 75, Udana 1). Hamid looks to turn the screw on the new man Udana, putting in two slips, but he overdoes it with one bouncer, which clears batsman and keeper’s head and goes for four byes. It’s been a productive anchor-knock from Extras in this innings, now Sri Lanka’s second top scorer with 31.Instead of watching all that thrilling carnage, OB Jato has been sketching out an imaginary, though plausible, world stare-out championships involving cricket sides:“The following is a transcript from the SMS (Stare Match Special) commentary box during their coverage of the I-See-See World Cup on 6th May, 2019:“And Faf du Plessis obviously has an edge in this contest here. His team’s played two matches prior to this, while the restriction put in place by the B-See-See-Eye means India are playing their first match in this tournament only today.“Virat Kohli is the other man out in the middle. He’s known to be quite an aggressive man at times, and KG Rabada has surely riled him up during the sensational interview he gave to the leading WebSight covering this sport.“The surface where both these men keep their hands is quite flat, as the pundits have predicted. The lack of grass which could tickle their funny bones caused concerns about the staring scores (number of seconds lasted by either side) rising beyond the limit which makes the game be a level playing field for all players. 400 is the new norm now, surely?“The Powerplay (where no objects held up by the ‘fielders’ can be put into the background where the opposition is looking towards) is over. And Kuldeep Yadav comes on. This is turning out be rather exciting. He’s moving his arms around in an unreadable manner and distracting the opposition. And Faf has blinked! Kohli, all this while, looks at the part-time spinners (who, ahem, spin stuff in his face) with tempered aggression, never looking like he was discomfortable. To think that he wears contact lenses too! Now, as soon as the contest is over, Kohli gets up, winks, and walks away.“So it’s official, folks. India have won the rights to flip the coin.”26th over: Sri Lanka 159-6 (K Perera 74, Udana 0). Kusal Perera cuts Nabi square on the offside for two and the bowler then concedes a wide with his first bad ball for some time. Then more chaos as T Perera sets off recklessly for a single, is sent back, and the shy at the stumps from Shahidi is scooped up by Shahzad, who breaks the bails and another one’s down. What a chance Afghanistan now have.Sri Lanka are imploding again. The dangerous Perera goes early too, victim of a poor decision to take a hasty single. He’s sent back but he’s out of his ground when Shahzad gathers the throw and he’s on his way.25th over: Sri Lanka 155-5 (K Perera 72, T Perera 2). Hamid has the bit between his teeth now, finding movement, the right length and applying pressure. This is glorious to watch (unless you’re Sri Lankan). That pressure shows again when K Perera takes a very nervous single, the batsmen unsure whether to run, and Mujeed almost cashes in with a shy at the stumps. Direct hit and that’s out. Who knows where this game’s headed now?24th over: Sri Lanka 152-5 (K Perera 70, T Perera 1). Just trying to digest all this, Sri Lanka’s shots and footwork was certainly suspect for those dismissals but this has been fine bowling and captaincy, a paceman suddenly on song at one end, a spinner bamboozling at the other. Nabi sends down another decent over yielding only three.23rd over: Sri Lanka 149-5 (K Perera 68, T Perera 0). Perera has suddenly become extremely important for Sri Lanka. He looks unperturbed and pulls Hamid for two that might have been a run out had Afghanistan’s fielding been sharper. But the Afghans look happier bowling at right-handers and Hamid whistles a beautiful leg-cutter past the new man De Silva’s outside edge. The keeper and two slips are well back now, in recognition of the bowler’s pace, and it gets its reward with De Silva’s dismissal to an absolute jaffa. Stunning. Don’t do anything else with your life but follow this.And there’s more! De Silva feathers a snorting away-seamer from Hamid Hassan through to the keeper. This is extraordinary.22nd over: Sri Lanka 146-4 (Perera 65). A stunning over from Nabi. The Sri Lanka fans’ band is making an agreeable racket, but it’s suddenly got much less to parp about as first Thirimanne, then Mendis then the venerable Mathews are dismissed, the latter two to identical edges to slip. The game done changed.Would you believe it! Another - Nabi has taken three wickets in five balls!And another! Nabi has a slip brought up, and it pays idends as the second of two edges in a row from the new batsman is snaffled by Rahmat. Do we now have a game?Nabi is back in the attack and back among the wickets, bowling Thirimanne with one that kept low and induced an awkward inside-edge onto the stumps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82b9ff93177eac7c61d6dded3e78080573e5433f/0_118_2765_1659/master/2765.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30c7df54be7a9dd701c0cfb19ece7617","title":"french open quarter finals johanna konta sloane stephens roger federer wawrinka rafa nadal nishikori","story":"There is nobody in this draw who wouldn’t be brought to a state of absolute terror by watching that Konta performance. It might be hard to maintain that ludicrously high level, but if she can she’ll be hard to stop.More chat from Konta: “It was a great performance, I thought. I was really pleased with the level I played, more than anything. Sloane is a reat player and I knew going into the match that it was going to be difficult. I’m just really pleased. The serve is definitely something I’m looking to utilise. I’m just happy I’m able to do that right now. I’m just so pleased with each match that I’m involved in, I’m really pleased with the work I’m doing with my team and overall just enjoying my tennis.”“To play on this court, this is my first match on Chatrier, to be out here and play at the level I did against one of the best players in the world, I’m just really proud of myself,” says Konta. So she should be. That was a simply incredible performance, a near-irresistible display of power, aggression and accuracy. On Chatrier, Wawrinka has broken in the second set, which he leads 3-1.Second set: Konta* 6-1, 6-4 Stephens Konta starts the game with an ace, and continues it with a service winner. It’s her 18th consecutive point won on serve in this set, a ludicrous run she proceeds to break with a double fault. She’s not delayed for long, though: another unreturnable serve down the middle and she has two match points. Stephens thinks she’s saved the first when her forehand is called in, but Konta asks the umpire to check the mark, and she confirms it was wide! Konta is through in straight sets!Second set: Konta 6-1, 5-4 Stephens* At 15-0 Konta forces Stephens into the net and has an easy passing opportunity, but with the whiff of a double-break victory in her nostrils she misses her chance, Stephens guesses the right way and puts the volley away. That’s the cushion she needs to win the game to 30, and Konta will now serve for the match.Second set: Konta* 6-1, 5-3 Stephens The first point is a statement of intent from Konta, starting with a fantastic first serve down the T – which Stephens miraculously manages to return reasonably well – and won with a pinpoint forehand. It’s another hold to love, completed with a forehand drop shot from well behind the baseline, which gives Stephens absolutely no chance.Second set: Konta 6-1, 4-3 Stephens* Stephens is famously fast around the court, but she has stopped chasing any but the weaker Konta shots, or those that head down the central third of the court. She still holds to 15, though, thanks to some fine serving and one wild backhand return. But having failed to win a single point against Konta’s serve in this set she must now break, and has only two more opportunities to do so.Second set: Konta* 6-1, 4-2 Stephens Konta’s fourth service game of the second set, and Stephens still hasn’t won a point. Just phenomenal.Second set: Konta 6-1, 3-2 Stephens* Konta’s second drop shot of the match is in no way as good as her first, and is dismissed by Stephens for a winner. That’s the first point of a straightforward hold, featuring two service winners and an absolutely vicious forehand. Meanwhile Federer has won the first set against Wawrinka, taking the tie-break 7-4.Second set: Konta* 6-1, 3-1 Stephens The first drop shot of the match has Stephens sprinting netwards, and by the time she reaches the ball she’s practically in it, which is where the ball ends up. Konta ends the game with an ace, and is yet to drop a point on her serve in this second set.Second set: Konta 6-1, 2-1 Stephens* The most fractional of dips by Konta, who hits a couple of shot very marginally long, and then a forehand return very wildly wide, giving Stephens a foothold in the set.Second set: Konta* 6-1, 2-0 Stephens Stephens is starting to look broken in spirit. She chases down a deep, vicious forehand and sends back a defensive shot that lands in, but from there she doesn’t even try to prolong the rally, letting Konta hit the ball into an empty court while she trudges back to her mark for the next point. Konta holds to love, and is playing absurdly well. Meanwhile on Lenglen, Wawrinka and Federer will settle the first set with a tie-break.Second set: Konta 6-1, 1-0 Stephens* At 30-30 Konta bounces her way to victory, hitting a backhand of such wild loopiness that even after running right to the back of the court and leaping as high as she possibly can Stephens can’t get anything on it. The American saves the ensuing break point but swiftly concedes another this time Konta approaches the net and Stephens hits a passing shot that whips across court but lands an inch wide! Konta leads by a set and a break!First set: Konta* 6-1 Stephens Stephens pretty much surrenders this game, once Konta wins the first point with a second serve that bounces up into the American’s body and can’t be returned. A service winner and an ace later Konta has three set points: Stephens saves the first, drawing her opponent to the net before passing, then Konta miscues a forehand off the frame of her racket and long, but she wins the game, and the set, at the third attempt! First set: Konta 5-1 Stephens* At 0-15 Stephens misses her first serve, and her second serve bounces invitingly to Konta’s backhand. She absolutely lashes it crosscourt for a winner, a shot of frightening aggression and accuracy. The next she wins with a backhand down the line, and that’s three break points. Stephens saves one, Konta saves the next for her with a wild forehand return, but a killer forehand takes the next point and Konta is up a double break!First set: Konta* 4-1 Stephens Konta didn’t win a single rally in this game. When Stephens got the ball back in play, she won the point. However, she didn’t get many balls back in play. A couple of forehand winners put Stephens 0-30 up, but the next time Konta has to play a groundstroke it’s 40-30, and though the American wins that point to take it to deuce, two more service winners take the game.First set: Konta 3-1 Stephens* Konta has shifted up into top gear now, and at this moment she is bettering Stephens. The third point is a fine example, the pair trading crosscourt forehands until Konta eventually nailed one too deep and too hard and Stephens couldn’t get it back. It’s soon 15-40, and though Stephens saves one break point with a phenomenal driven forehand, she surrenders the next with a backhand that drops long! First set: Konta* 2-1 Stephens Konta holds to 15 and even the point she lost was emphatically bossed, although she ended it by hitting her forehand winner, with Stephens marooned on the other side of the court, six inches wide. First set: Konta 1-1 Stephens* Both players have rapidly hit their straps, trading clean, powerful strokes from the baseline. Stephens has a considerably easier time holding her serve than Konta did, though, taking the game to 15 and ending it with a very fine deep, spinning serve that forced Konta too wide.First set: Konta* 1-0 Stephens Konta overhits a forehand and then a first serve, Stephens pouncing to take a 0-30 lead with an excellent, deep forehand. Konta fights back to 30-30 only to concede a break point. She saves that, has a few game points of her own and finally holds a lengthy and very promising game. By the time it ends, Wawrinka is already 2-1 up on Lenglen, with serve.Ready to rock. Stephens won the toss, and chose to receive.The players are out and preparing for action. I’ll be concentrating initially on Konta v Stephens, but will keep a beady eye on action on Suzanne Lenglen.Here’s Kevin Mitchell on Jo Konta and her latest coach, Dimitri Zavialoff. She and Sloane Stephens have played only twice, both this year, and Konta has won both matches. Most recently, she beat Stephens 6-7, 6-4, 6-1 in Rome last month.We have only four matches of senior, singles tennis ahead of us today, but they’re good ’uns. First up, it’s Stan Wawrinka v Roger Federer on Suzanne Lenglen, with Federer holding a 22-3 head-to-head advantage over his compatriot. Wawrinka’s last victory over Federer was in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros in 2015, the year he won the title, and all three Wawrinka wins have come on clay, the other two in Monte Carlo in 2014 and 2009. Counting only games on clay, Federer’s head-to-head lead is only 4-3. Meanwhile, on Philippe Chatrier, it’s Johanna Konta v Sloane Stephens for a place in what would be the Briton’s third Grand Slam semi-final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc896c28070690d234e150cacbf11d17ed688a8c/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d81f481b5eed191799687f4b395225df","title":"europe uk theme parks family days out readers","story":"From Moomins in Finland to zooming down slides in the Pyrenees, our readers pick thrilling parks across EuropeThis mountain park is home to Tobotronc, a really exhilarating 5km toboggan run – the world’s longest alpine slide – which runs through evergreen forest.

Lou Sanders, Jamie Demetriou and more offer guidance on the ways of courtshipLou SandersI’m terrible at dating so very, very happy to give some advice: 1) Everyone loves mystery so when you go on a date, think to yourself: “I have a little secret” – let that come out in your eyes. 2) Bars or restaurants are too cliche. Take them to a Wickes or Wilko DIY store. Some Wilkos have a nice patio area. 3) People say you have to be a good listener. Nonsense. Just say you’re a good listener and they should believe you (if they’ve been listening). 4) Learn a magic trick! Everyone loves magic. Don’t do the chopping a person in half stuff though. A bit OTT and could come across as needy when you get the box and assistant out from the car.Jamie DemetriouI heard a song once that said: “You say it best when you say nothing at all.” It taught me that whenever you’re on a date, you should play that song all the time, because people love incredible songs. Another piece of advice I got – from someone else from Boyzone whose name rhymes withis Mikey – was “Remember to never stop talking too much during the date.” On a date there are opportunities to say so many wicked and interesting things – “Some of the singers on X Factor have been so young over the years!” or “You OK?” or “Squad goal” – which will reassure your date that you know how to talk in a stylish, current way. This will bode well for a longer relationship, as couples tend to need to talk to each other up to 50 times before considering marriage.Arnab ChandaCome from a happy childhood. If you didn’t have a happy childhood, build a time machine and go back in time and alter events. If this is not possible, start drinking on a nightly basis. Act jovial and loud. You will subconsciously be attracted to people who make you feel the way your parents did: inadequate and bullied. Consider finding someone who also had a horrific childhood, but who makes you feel relaxed. This is a “soulmate”. Marry them, love them, and then orce them five to 20 years later after you’ve both changed irreversibly. Repeat cycle until you find another “soulmate”. Be with them until one of you dies. “Never forget that life is horrible” – Thomas the Tank Engine (1985).Johnny White Really ReallyIn the year of 2015, I remember thinking, in a moment of lightheartedness, that I should ask someone out. A specific person. And one Sunday, I was at a friend’s house, let’s call him Metthew, who knew this person. And, after a few pints of Casillero del Diablo, I decided to tell Mett my plan. “You know what, Mett? I think I’m gonna ask out So-And-So”. Mett looked momentarily paralysed by confusion and then said: “Yeah. I mean. If you want to.” And I crawled back into my vibe-castle, and drew up the drawbridge. So my dating advice is quite simply this: DAYITMB – Don’t Announce Your Intentions To Mett Beforehand.Phoebe WalshWhenever life is boring, I either leave my hair straighteners on to add a bit of jeopardy, or text my ex. I just have a single sip of vodka and diet Coke and I’m in my yellow notes, drafting away (this is white girl culture?). Rules of messaging: when I text, it’s hotenigmatic. If they reply after 7pm it means they’re in love with me. If they use my name in the text, it means they want 3+ kids with me. However, my friend recently told me something that’s very nearly, almost made me stop this habit: “The most proactive thing in dating is to do nothing.” If they like you they’ll make it known – and if they don’t, it’s fine. Not sharing my food is my love language anyway.Dane BaptisteI had my romantic awakening during the 90s, when all the best R\u0026ampB music was made (Babyface, Boyz II Men, Brandy, Monica, etc) and I still try to represent their values in my dating: charm, great taste, bathing in milk and suggestive imagery with fruit. That being said, the best advice I’ve been given is: “Start as you mean to go on.” Dating a lot of the time is like going for a job interview on behalf of your heart and libido, with your ego as a recruitment consultant. If there’s any potential with someone, come as you are don’t be the person you think will please somebody else.

Its cast and creators reveal what to expectComing hot on the heels of the disturbing real-life rollback of reproductive rights in the States, the award-winning dystopian drama returns this month in the US for a third season. Having left Margaret Atwood’s seminal source material far behind at the end of season one, the show’s writers are now plotting a path for our protagonist June entirely under their own steam. The action picks up 10 minutes after the final scene of season two – here’s what to expect …Even some ardent fans of the show abandoned season two, unable to endure its unremitting brutality, from the fake public executions to the drowning of two young lovers. Showrunner Bruce Miller has taken that on board. “We listened to the feedback, and in terms of it being too harsh, I agree. June went through a really tough year last year, and in the end she triumphed, but it was really hard,” he says. This season, the on-screen brutality has been reduced. “So much of this season is about hope,” says Elisabeth Moss. “It’s radically important to have that for the world right now, and for our audience, to show that there is hope and that there is a way out.”The show’s 2019 Super Bowl advert previewed some of the most eerie scenes from the series so far: the Washington Monument replaced with a cross, thousands of Handmaids assembled in front. Washington DC is still the centre of power in Gilead – “Gilead on steroids,” says Littlefield – and the regime in the capital, where June, Fred and Serena all spend time, is more fundamentalist, orthodox and restrictive.The red robes of the Handmaids have achieved significance well beyond the story, co-opted by protesters in the US, Brazil and beyond, campaigning against restrictions on women’s reproductive freedoms. In Gilead’s capital, the uniforms are even stricter, with all women’s mouths (bar those of the Aunts) entirely covered by veils, and Handmaids’ mouths pierced closed, with three rings through the lips. “Gilead claims that a vow of silence has been taken by the most devout Handmaids,” says the show’s producer, Kim Todd.A fearsome enforcer of Gilead’s oppressive regime for the past two seasons, Aunt Lydia, we shall see, has limits to her adherence. “The creepy thing about Washington, other than the veils, is that everyone seems to be so in compliance,” says the actor behind Lydia, Ann Dowd. “People have either given up or it’s like in North Korea, where you don’t even dare step out of line. This is not Aunt Lydia’s thing. She doesn’t believe in these extra, more extreme steps. She just wants to go home.” The Handmaid’s Tale starts on Hulu on Wednesday 5 June in the US and on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday 9 June"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/156efb4660dc0f0b1006f90111644226ed034466/0_410_8508_5105/master/8508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49228dc7628bf857d2cb5cfc144b6d31","title":"three venezuelan families a photo essay","story":"Silvana Trevale left Venezuela in 2011 but has returned to document the ever worsening crisis that has deeply affected families of every economic status. She was selected as the 2018 recipient of the Joan Wakelin Bursary, administrated in partnership with the Royal Photographic SocietyVenezuela, a country that once hoped for wealth and a bright future with its oil reserves and natural resources, is falling to pieces. It faces a humanitarian crisis where families struggle daily to find food, medicine and clean water as they live with collapsing public services. Many attend the ongoing protests, which are frequently violently repressed. Though I left my home in 2011 I have returned to Venezuela to document the ever-worsening crisis that has deeply affected families of every economic status.As a young Venezuelan woman, my focus was to the youth of the country in relation to how the current crisis has harmedtheir past and present, and jeopardised their future. Three families with contrasting realities took part in the photo essay, allowing me into their homes so that I could gain an insight into their lives.Firstly, I met an upper-class family, who asked to keep their identity anonymous for their own security. The youngest girl, who is a past contestant in the Miss Venezuela beauty pageant, has left the country to pursue her career as a model. Her brother and sister have been out of Venezuela for more than two years, working in their fields. The father said: “If they had told me, that at my age my children were going to leave because there were no opportunities, we would have left.”He works as a hotel manager while he witnesses the economy fall apart, constantly trying to maintain a balance in his job alongside spiralling inflation. He said in January: “The difficulty in obtaining foreign currency is what has affected us the most. In October, the black market dollar equalled 90 bolivars and is now at 2,500 bolivars.”The Melean family are working hard to achieve their dreams. Estefferson, the oldest brother, is now living in Chicago and studying nursing. He is covering all of his expenses with a baseball scholarship. He returned for the holidays to visit his family and his hopes for the future are high. Estefferson said: “I can open the doors for my family, to move forward and get out of where we live, as I would like them to live in a better place in the future.” They live in El Valle in Caracas, at the bottom of a favela area that is not safe.The youngest brother, Gerson, is following the same dream. He is training to be signed by the Major League Baseball (MLB) organisation, while he continues his high school studies at the weekends. Sarai, the youngest sister, was completing her studies at the Andrés Bello Catholic University. However, she had to stop as the cost became too high for the family to cover.She said: “It’s tough to live with fear, knowing that for a pair of earrings, some shoes or a telephone they can kill you. The people are so desperate, they are so hungry.”Yesenia, their mother, works full time as a secretary, although she sometimes does not make it to her job across the city. With the current electricity blackouts, transportation is not working most days Public transport is not available because of the lack of spare parts and their high prices.Lastly, the Fermin family lives in a small town called Mamporal, a 90-minute drive from Caracas. The mother has 11 children however many of them have left the country or are residing in other states of Venezuela. Five of her children live at home with her and her husband, Felix. The oldest son living at home is Abraham, who is away during the week while he trains to join the military.The 15-year-old son, also called Felix, said: “I want to be an artist to help my mom.”. He spends his time drawing Catholic figures with the hope of becoming an artist one day. Carmen, the youngest girl, said: “My desire is to leave Venezuela, become a doctor and help my family.”Wanda, 17, was seven months pregnant with twins when I photographed her. She had been raped by a neighbour. Wanda has since given birth to two girls. The Fermin family struggle to feed themselves and the children are showing signs of malnutrition, as they often miss out on breakfast and dinner.Imelda, the mother, has cancer and no treatment is available in the country. They have travelled several times to Caracas in search of medical attention, often without success. When Wanda was about to give birth, they were taken to Caracas in search of a hospital that could help them, after visiting four hospitals and being rejected because of a lack of space and facilities. Finally, as a relative knew a doctor in one of the hospitals, they managed to take Wanda in and look after her during her birth.Venezuela’s current crisis seems to have no end in sight. The country’s citizens are doing what they can to continue, but it is becoming harder day by day. The younger generation, still proclaim some hope at least. I am reminded of the moment when Carlos, Wanda and Carmen were playing in the water. They danced as if they had a break from reality, as if the water washed away their troubles for a moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d82062b38cee545e7342cb8e985200ecdba4da87/0_141_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb8c96e0b0aa71151ee703831dcdec8","title":"athens youngest mayor kostas bakoyannis real life not utopias","story":"Centrist Kostas Bakoyannis says his approach transcends isions that have long defined GreeceThe mayor-elect of Athens says he doesn’t believe in grand projects, nor does he “do utopias”. What he prefers to focus on is “real life” – and seeing it by walking and talking with almost everyone he meets.It has paid off. After visiting 129 neighbourhoods across Athens since launching his campaign to become the capital’s youngest mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis, at 41, has been catapulted to the top office of City Hall with the widest margin of victory ever. With him comes a team of councillors that will be among the most politically erse on record.“That might mean focusing on cleanliness, garbage collection, lighting, things that Athens has fallen behind on, things that make a difference and other capitals take for granted. Greek politicians may like to talk up big, eternal issues but frankly they are above our pay grade.”Tall and lean with a penchant for wristbands, Bakoyannis is the scion of Greece’s leading political dynasty – one that is being increasingly compared to the Kennedys. As he was the product of a British boarding school and Ivy League colleges in the US, including Harvard where he went on to do graduate work, the lure of politics seemed inevitable. Equally inevitable were charges of nepotism.His uncle Kyriakos Mitsotakis, to whom he bears an uncanny likeness, heads the centre-right opposition party, New Democracy. His mother, Dora, was Athens mayor before becoming foreign minister. His grandfather, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, led New Democracy, serving as prime minister from 1990 to 1993.But Bakoyannis, who was mayor of Karpenisi before becoming governor of central Greece, a region encompassing 25 municipalities, has not been shy of criticising politicians past and present.Under his stewardship, the mountainous area became a champion in absorption of EU funds, money that enabled infrastructure projects to transform parts of one of Europe’s poorest districts.But while Bakoyannis says taking up a post previously held by his mother heralds a new political era, he emphasises that his team transcends the entrenched political isions that have long defined Greece. In the wake of almost a decade of financial crisis – one that hit Athens hardest as the capital on the frontline of austerity reeled from protests, strikes and riots – consensus has never been needed more.“I’d like to think we are about bridging differences and forging alliances with everyone,” says the young mayor-elect whose politician father, Pavlos, was murdered 30 years ago by the far-left terrorist group November 17.“Politics shouldn’t be about fear, ision and demagoguery, it should be about bringing people together. Ours is a team that crosses parties and political ideology in every way, and that’s because we want to work from the bottom up, not the top down.”With polls projecting victory for the conservatives in the 7 July snap elections, Mitsotakis has also sought to sound a note of consensus. A liberal reformist at the helm of a party comprised of factions that range from the nationalist to the populist right, the electoral wins, and unexpected margin of defeat for Syriza, have vindicated a leader who at times has faced criticism from within his own ranks.As it became clear candidates supported by New Democracy had swept the nation, the 51-year-old politician underscored the need for national unity, declaring: “The map has been painted blue but, in this case, blue is not the colour of our party but of our country.”Conceding defeat, Tsipras told supporters it was “important in life to learn how to win and how to lose”. The leftist leader, who will call on the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, on 10 June to request that parliament be dissolved and the process for early elections formally initiated, said Syriza would rally its forces for “the mother of all battles”.The seat of Athens mayor has long been seen as a stepping stone to a career in central government. Bakoyannis’s predecessor, Giorgos Kaminis, has gone on to become a candidate for the centre-left Kinal (Movement for Change) party. But while Kaminis did much to promote Athens internationally – helping turn it into a much-visited tourist destination after years of crisis – he has also been criticised for not doing enough to improve the quality of services for citizens.“Local politics is where I am staying,” says Bakoyannis who, perhaps buoyed and bowled over by his success, hastens to add that no mayor in the history of modern Athens has ever won with such a large mandate. “There is something very rewarding about coming up with real solutions to real problems in the form of tangible and visible results.“The moment you see me not walking the streets, not talking to people, not listening to their problems or hearing their views, you should know that that’s when I will have failed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35de780d278c094de900e4cbd82f7e6fad823190/0_0_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c0bbf35b8da3cc0afa6b939433ef0d9","title":"finland pledges to become carbon neutral by 2035","story":"New left-leaning government sets ambitious target as it plans major rise in public spendingFinland’s new left-leaning coalition government has pledged to make the country carbon neutral by 2035 as part of a policy programme that includes a major increase in public spending on welfare and infrastructure.The Social Democratic party leader, Antti Rinne, who formed the five-party alliance of centrist, leftist and Green parties after narrowly beating the nationalist Finns party in an election in April, said it was time to “invest in the future” after years of austerity.Pekka Haavisto, the Green League party chair, said the programme – which will increase public spending by €1.23bn (£1.1bn) a year and spend another €3bn on one-off investments, notably in the rail network, over the four-year lifetime of the government – was “probably the most ambitious in the world” on climate issues.Climate campaigners welcomed the announcement. “People demanded faster climate action and that’s what we’re going to get,” said Sini Harkki, the Finland programme manager of Greenpeace Nordic.“Building the world’s first fossil-free, sustainable society is going to require much more than nice words on paper, but we’re determined to make it happen. It’s an exciting journey we want to embark on.”Harkki said the government’s programme, which will have major implications for the country’s key forestry industry and use of peat for energy, was far from perfect. But with “the broad public support we now have for transformational change, the fights can be won”, she said.The target should not involve Finland buying credits for CO2-reducing projects in other countries, the government said, although that would be subject to a review scheduled for 2025.Rinne, the country’s first leftist prime minister in 20 years, said his administration’s plans were aimed squarely at reducing income differences in Finland through increased spending on education, pensions and social services.Austerity measures imposed by the outgoing centre-right government succeeded in cutting public spending by €4bn and reducing Finland’s debt for the first time in a decade, but made it deeply unpopular.The nationalist, Eurosceptic Finns were excluded from the coalition talks, with Rinne opting instead to partner with the Centre party of the outgoing prime minister, Juha Sipilä, as his main coalition ally, in addition to the Greens, the Left Alliance and the Swedish People’s party of Finland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48168a6c6767dd51cfb7aee8d25bd4caafcd090f/0_232_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61099402b3e28ea9999d6c489c5e90ed","title":"tiananmen china hong kong vigil anniversary","story":"Thirty years after bloody crackdown, visitors have IDs checked and foreign journalists barred from entering square Security forces have been deployed throughout Tiananmen Square in Beijing, 30 years on from a deadly crackdown on student demonstrators in the city that marked one of the darkest chapters in the country’s history.Plainclothes and uniformed police patrolled the perimeter of the square, where crowds of tourists waited for security personnel to scan their ID cards. An armoured police car was stationed along a street leading to the square. Asked about the extra checks, a police officer said: “Today is a bit special.”Foreign journalists were not allowed to enter the square and plainclothes police blocked reporters from taking photos by opening umbrellas in front of them. Major foreign news sites that had not been previously blocked in China, including CNN, Reuters, and Bloomberg, could not be accessed on Tuesday. On 3 June through the morning of 4 June 1989, the Chinese government deployed the military to put down almost two months of student-led protests that called for political reforms.Tanks and troops converged on Tiananmen Square, shooting and in some cases crushing civilians. Estimates for the death toll range from a few hundreds to 3,000. A secret UK diplomatic cable released in 2017 put the figure at at least 10,000.China has issued few statements about the Tiananmen crackdown, which is largely omitted from history books. Official media on Tuesday made no mention of the anniversary, instead featuring articles about the Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s promotion of refuse sorting, an environmental campaign, and calls to “remember the mission” of the Chinese Communist party.When pushed to comment, officials justify the government’s use of force as necessary for the country’s stability and economic development. China’s defence minister, Wei Fenghe, on Sunday defended the crackdown as the “correct” policy to end “political turbulence” at the time.On Monday, the state-run tabloid Global Times praised the government’s response, calling it a “vaccination” for Chinese society, providing “immunity against any major political turmoil in the future”.Before the anniversary, other countries called for China to acknowledge its use of violence against unarmed citizens.  The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said China must “make a full public accounting of those killed or missing”. China on Tuesday called those remarks “an affront to the Chinese people”.The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, reiterated the European council’s statement from 1989, describing the government’s actions as a “brutal repression”. She called on authorities to respect the legal rights of those detained in connection with the 1989 protests as well as those who have tried to commemorate them.Observers say the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown was a turning point for the country, marking the Chinese leadership’s bend towards authoritarianism. In the spring of 1989, after years of increased openness, authorities were confronted with student movements in more than 300 cities, calling for reforms, an end to government corruption, a free press, and other demands.After weeks of ision within the senior leadership, conservative voices within the government won out, opting to use force to clear the centre of the movement, the protests in Tiananmen Square. Thousands were arrested after the crackdown and the government launched a propaganda drive to recast the episode as the successful “quelling of a counter-revolutionary rebellion”.Since then, the party leadership has focused on expanding and opening its economy, while tightening the space available to civil society. After Xi came to power in 2012, Chinese activists and human rights advocates have come under even more pressure and censorship has increased.In the lead-up to the 4 June anniversary, dozens of activists have been detained and censorship appears to have increased. Restrictions were placed on the “Tiananmen mothers”, a group of elderly women whose sons were killed. Many activists based in China are “travelled” outside of their cities and kept under close watch by minders.On Tuesday, the search terms “Tiananmen” and “6,4,30” in reference to the 30-year anniversary, were blocked on the microblog Weibo. On WeChat, users could not change their usernames.Activists in China said they planned to fast for the day, barred from being able to commemorate the event in any public way or with others. “Even though we are scattered … we are united and together,” said one of the organisers, based in China, who asked not to be named for security reasons.In neighbouring Hong Kong, activists are commemorating the event with an annual candlelight vigil attracting about 180,000 people. “The whole of China is silenced, and we have a window, or a loudspeaker for that in Hong Kong, to tell the world what happened,” said Lee Cheuk-yan, a former legislator who was in Beijing at the time of the crackdown.“I heard the gunshots, and saw the tanks rolling in, the rickshaws taking injured people,” said Lee, who was a labour organiser in 1989. “When I came back from Beijing 20 years ago, people told me to make sure you tell the world the truth.”On Tuesday, activity around Tiananmen Square appeared normal. Tourists holding umbrellas to block the sun made their way to the main square. Groups of students followed their teachers in neat lines. Souvenir shops were open, selling memorial plates featuring Mao Zedong’s portrait.Despite the censorship, some Chinese citizens found ways to mark the day, posting poems, images, or songs. One user posted a photo of himself standing in front of a Mao portrait, which faces Tiananmen Square, in the early morning hours. “Tomb sweeping,” he wrote, a reference to a Chinese tradition of honouring the dead.Other users posted a 1933 essay by a famous Chinese writer, Lu Xun, remembering a group of young writers and activists who had previously been killed by government forces.Users posted the quote: “The night is long, the road is also long. It is better I forget, not to mention it. But I know even if it weren’t for me, there would always be someone who remembers them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/582065e22de4b144a1905da417496a27838b3614/0_129_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e6f995a24896a9fbea5876ddb826c88","title":"what tiananmen means to chinese diaspora","story":"Members of the Chinese community in Britain, Australia and New Zealand born after 1989 on the far-reaching consequences of the deadly crackdownMy mother was there when it happened: she was studying in Beijing at the time. She didn’t tell me about it at first, I actually heard of the massacre in school and I was bullied for it by kids who were like: “How could you do that to your own people?” It was one of the first moments in my childhood when I realised I’m not English, I’m an other. I am Chinese and this is part of my history.My mum was slowly able to tell me what happened and of the violence she saw. I used to think: “Why aren’t you saying more?” But I realised now it’s because she doesn’t want to think about it. It was a traumatic thing for her.I wrote a play about the protest, called Clouds Over Beijing, which was performed at Omnibus theatre as part of a festival to mark the 30th anniversary. The play is about four students who think they’re going to change the world and do something great. It wasn’t necessarily something I wanted to do: it felt more like my duty – to my parents, my community, and my motherland.Watching the performance was very sobering. There was a feeling of solidarity, that I’m not alone in this. We as a community are still thinking about this, its an important thing in our culture and we’re not letting it fade away. I’m glad people came and that they still care. People should care. In China, people are rapidly forgetting about it. You talk to people my age and they don’t even know it happened.This has been an important part of my life but I’ve never done anything about it until now. But now I have, seeing this event and seeing everyone coming together gives me so much hope that eventually things will get better. It’s something we need to talk about, continue having a dialogue on. It’s still relevant: not just for the people in China but for people all over the world.We shouldn’t forget just how subversive and brave what these students were doing was back then. They were campaigning for freedom of speech and press, and were putting themselves at risk.It is important we remember events like Tiananmen Square, but we need to do more than just remember the atrocities that happened. We should remember the people before they died and what they were fighting for. These were real people. They were kids who had lives, dreams, ambitions, who thought they could change the world, and for two months they did.I was born in Hong Kong and my family moved to Sydney when I was three years old.At home we spoke Cantonese. I grew up quite bilingual and quite balanced in terms of the mix of Aussie and Chinese cultures. We used to go and visit Hong Kong every year for a month around Christmas time, so I still had a strong connection to the place.I can’t remember when I first heard about Tiananmen Square but it would’ve been when I was very young – like primary school – and most likely it was through my parents. When they were in Hong Kong in 1989 they went out on the marches, they were invested in that as well, seeing that hope for China to liberalise, to be more free.I don’t want to speak for my parents and get it wrong, but I think for them and for a lot of people of their generation, it was a big shock. They didn’t think something like that would happen in the late 80s as China was opening up.I was born a year after 1989, but for me, 4 June, it has a particular place, I do feel emotionally invested in it. Maybe it’s because my family is from Hong Kong and Hong Kong has kept that flame of 4 June alive for so many years. It’s the only place under Beijing’s jurisdiction that you can do that: that you can have that commemoration and have people aware and educate the next generation about it.4 June was a missed opportunity, a juncture where China could have taken a path but actually chose not to and we’ve seen since then, the economy it has liberalised, but the political side of things hasn’t changed and arguably has gotten worse in recent years under the current president.For me 4 June is a symbol of what could have been and it’s also a hope of what could be the case in the future, which is why commemorating 4 June is really important, especially when the Chinese government wants people to forget, or wants to write their own version of what happened.When I hear about it I feel sad, and I feel most people don’t know about it. In the Chinese community, you know about it if you’re local born but a lot of the overseas Chinese don’t know about it, or they have a different interpretation of what it is, or they disregard it or don’t want to acknowledge it.Quite recently with friends they denied it, which is based on their values. But it is good to open their mind up to different things based on fact. I think its good to keep the conversation going and the memories, otherwise you’ll forget and it will become like nothing."},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Homes in Ballymun and Ballyfermot to be available to low- and middle-income buyersFuneral held in Portlaoise of Sully and Vincent Rossi who died in Co Offaly last weekImpact of global tax avoidance by multinationals also criticised in speechRetail body warns of copycats and amateurs who think stores are easy targets\u0026lsquoSeconds can change your life\u0026rsquo says Transdev in latest appeal to motorists, cyclists and pedestriansTrevor Birney: Police had a choice \u0026ndash to go after us or the killersCharlie Flanagan warns young people \u0026lsquobling\u0026rsquo associated with drug dealing lifestyle will not lastHigh Court decision forms part of his bid to overturn conviction for Elaine O\u0026rsquoHara murderTaoiseach sought meeting with former president despite concerns of officialsCurrent system \u0026lsquooverly favours the plaintiff\u0026rsquo, Pat McDonagh saysFigures based on inaccurate and unreliable register of voters, elections expert saysEuropean championships open to both Northern Ireland and Republic unionsDaniel O\u0026rsquoConnell owes \u0026euro13 million including interest on original bill for \u0026pound6.3 millionMaxwells sought bill of \u0026euro1.8m after initial payment of \u0026euro2.2m for its work in 2005Number of alleged abusers identified by Scouting Ireland increases to nearly 250Issues include errors in claims for expenses and a lack of records on conflicts of interestDepartment of Education says excess cash will go towards National Children\u0026rsquos HospitalMajority of those who escaped did so from Cavan\u0026rsquos low-security Loughan House"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3914376.1559649924!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"luas releases cctv footage showing collisions and near misses","story":"Transdev, operators of Dublin\u0027s Luas tram system, has released footage of a series of near misses between Luas trams and pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.

Luas had 14 contacts with vehicles (one resulted in the tram derailing).On the 15th anniversary of the reintroduction of trams into Dublin City the tram system continues to grow with 42 million passenger journeys made on its network in 2018.Séamus Egan, Managing Director of Transdev said the problem was that people had become familiar with Luas “and with familiarity sometimes comes complacency”.He said motorists “who often visibly speed up to cross a road junction as opposed to slowing down, need to be more mindful of the potential consequences of their actions”.“Not only is the motorist gambling with his or her life and the lives of others, a collision with a tram results in significant delays to, or curtailment of service for Luas customers. When a collision with a tram does occur, Luas passengers are left waiting for the emergency services to deal with the incident before the all-clear can be given for the Luas service to resume”, he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3914269.1559652013!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in scrutiny of recount in ireland south uncomfortable claims green candidate","story":"A recount is under way of European election ballot papers in the Ireland South constituency and is expected to last a number of days.The recount follows a request from outgoing Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada last Wednesday night as she faced losing her European Parliament seat to the Green Party’s Senator Grace O’Sullivan.Ms Ní Riada polled 79,072 first preferences to Senator O’Sullivan’s 75,948 but by the 18th count Senator O’Sullivan had overtaken Ms Ní Riada, who was left trailing by 326 votes and facing the loss of her seat.At the recount at Nemo Rangers GAA Club in Cork, Ms O’Sullivan said she remained hopeful of taking a seat.“I’ve never been at a recount before so it’s a new process for me. I think everyone was jaded by last Thursday and everyone was glad to get away from here. Now we have a recount and they began this morning and the returning officer is processing everything diligently,” she said.“The margin is 326 votes which is a big different to make up but anything is possible and I have to stay realistic but at the same time, I’m remaining hopeful that they won’t make up the difference and of course, it can go the other way too, the margin might increase,” she added.The recount began this morning with some 130 counters splitting into two groups of 65 with each group. They are being supervised and checked by 20 staff, having been asked to count the first preferences votes of Ms O’Sullivan and Ms Ní Riada at either side of the sports complex hall.Ms O’Sullivan, who travelled from her home in Tramore in Co Waterford, for the 9am start, said she was a bit surprised to find Sinn Féin had allocated all their scrutineers to where her votes were being counted, with none monitoring Ms Ní Riada’s recount.“Sinn Féin spotters are surrounding the ballot papers of O’Sullivan. There’s no one viewing the ballot papers of Ní Riada. They have around 20 people... scrutinizing my papers which makes me feel a little bit uncomfortable,” she said, gesturing towards members of Sinn Féin watching her votes.“I didn’t expect that. I thought they would be split between both of us and keeping an eye on both our first-preference votes, rather than putting all the focus on me and my votes. They are absolutely looking for errors on my side and not on their own side, which feels a bit uncomfortable.”Ms O’Sullivan said she fully understood why Ms Ní Riada had sought a recheck of votes on Friday, but when the initial check reduced the margin between them by just one, she said that she herself would not have gone on to seek the full recount that Sinn Féin subsequently sought.She welcomed the fact that Returning Officer Martin Harvey had drafted in extra staff to help speed up the recount, as she felt reports that it could have taken up to 28 working days did not sit well with the public. And she welcomed the suggestion that the recount could be finished by the weekend.Ms Ní Riada was not present this morning but Cork North Central Sinn Féin TD Jonathan O’Brien was among those scrutinizing Ms O’Sullivan’s votes, and he strongly defended his party’s decision.“Yes, we do stand over our decision to seek a recount. Looking at the votes there, in the first two hours we’ve seen a number of discrepancies that have already been identified. I’ve personally seen votes that have been allocated to Grace that clearly were not for Grace,” Mr O’Brien said.“I haven’t looked at Liadh’s bundle of votes but it is obvious to me that there are some discrepancies in Grace’s votes. How many, we will have to wait until the end of the day to see but from what we’ve seen so far, we were right to seek the recount.”Mr O’Brien said the next step, as he understood it, was that counters would begin recounting the first preference votes of other candidates on Wednesday to make sure that their votes were properly tallied, and he expected the issue to be resolved within a number of days.“We certainly won’t prolong the process and we’ve said that from the outset…I think the time scale has already been revised down by the Returning Officer from 28 days to a number of days. I would concur with that and I would not see it going past, probably, the weekend.”However, Mr O’Brien said he did see any prospect of Sinn Féin making any decision on whether to abandon the full recount until all first preferences for each candidate are counted and a clearer picture emerges of the margins between the various contenders.Both Cork City Council and the Court Services have released staff for the process, with some 120 counters counting the ballot papers with a further 20 supervisory staff involved in compiling the votes.Mr Harvey declined to comment on how long the count might take.However, there has been some speculation the count could be finished at the weekend, with informed sources expressing surprise at some media reports that it could take up to 25 days to get a result.The count began this morning with one group of counters recounting Ms Ní Riada’s first-preference vote and another group recounting Senator O’Sullivan’s vote, with both being scrutinised by party officials.Fine Gael’s sitting MEP, Sean Kelly has already been elected, passing the quota of 119,866 on the ninth count to take the first seat with Fianna Fáil TD Billy Kelleher taking the second seat on the 17th count.The distribution of Mr Kelleher’s surplus left Independent Mick Wallace ahead of sitting Fine MEP Deirdre Clune, with Senator O’Sullivan ahead of Ms Ní Riada.The order in which the seats are filled is important as the fifth and final seat in the constituency only comes into play once the UK leaves the European Union following a Brexit deal.Twelve counties make up the European election constituency of Ireland South.Full results and in depth analysis of the local elections"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Gunman arrested after he fired pump action shotgun in Australian suburb of WoolnerNorth Korean leader criticises \u0026lsquowrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude\u0026rsquoTourists queue in Beijing as censorship ramped up three decades after bloody crackdown#KuToo demands government ban companies from requiring women to wear heels at workMany died in China on June 4th, 1989.

The woman next to Ri Sol-ju appears to be Mr Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong. Photograph: Korean Central News AgencyKorea News Service via APKim Jong-un’s influential younger sister has appeared in public for the first time in more than 50 days, attending the “Mass Games” propaganda displays that the North Korean leader later criticised for their “wrong spirit”.Kim Yo-jong, who was by Mr Kim’s side throughout both of his meetings with the US president, was shown seated next to her brother at the event in Pyongyang on Monday evening.Reports suggested that he had ordered her to keep a low profile after the failure of his recent nuclear summit with Donald Trump. Ms Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and senior North Korean officials at the 150,000-seat May Day Stadium to watch thousands of performers on the opening night of the event.Despite his sister’s apparent appreciation for the gymnasts and dancers’ efforts, the North Korean leader was unhappy with the performance.The state news agency KCNA said Mr Kim had “called creators of the performance and seriously criticised them for their wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude, pointing to the contents and forms of works”.Noting that artists “have a very important duty in socialist cultural construction”, Mr Kim “set forth important tasks for correctly implementing the revolutionary policy of our Party on literature and art,” KCNA added.Following rehearsals over several months, vast numbers of people in colourful costumes took part in the precision synchronised performance, portraying moments from Korean history and modern life.North Korean artistic performances are closely watched by observers for clues as to the authorities’ priorities, such as whether they are highlighting economic achievements or military progress.The senior government officials present at the games included Kim Yong-chol, the North’s counterpart to US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, in nuclear talks.Mistaken reportSouth Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper had mistakenly reported that Kim Yong-chol had been sent to a labour camp after a second summit between Kim Jong-un and US president Donald Trump broke up without agreement in Hanoi in February.Unmentioned in the KCNA story was Kim Hyok-chol, North Korea’s special envoy to the US who – according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper – was executed by firing squad for “betraying the supreme leader” after he was “won over to the US” during pre-summit negotiations.On Tuesday, CNN, claimed that Kim was alive but in custody and under investigation for his role in the failed summit. Citing one of several unnamed sources, CNN said his fate had not been decided, but that he could still face “heavy punishment”.Kim Yo-jong – Kim Jong-un’s sister, – had not appeared in public since April, when she attended supreme people’s assembly, according to South Korea’s Yonhap news agency.Speculation that she had been disciplined after Mr Kim and Mr Trump failed to reach an agreement at their February meeting in Hanoi rose after she was absent from Mr Kim’s entourage when he travelled to Vlaostok in April to meet Vladimir Putin, Yonhap added.The show, known in the North as a Grand Mass Gymnastics and Artistic Performance, is titled The Land of the People and is expected to run for five months, into October.Traditionally, the scenes on the arena floor take place against an ever-changing backdrop, made up of thousands of children turning the coloured pages of books in sequence to create giant images rippling across one side of the stadium. – "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeDonald Trump visit: Jeremy Corbyn snubbed by Donald Trump after Labour leader requested meeting - live updatesBrexit latest news: James Cleverly pulls out of leadership race as party poised to change rules to narrow fieldInternational community urged to act as number of Ebola cases hits 2,000Army medic who attacked wife \u0026#39blames mental breakdown after Manchester bomb attack\u0026#39Kim Jong-un criticises Mass Games in unprecedented blast at national gymnastics performanceComment: With Labour on the rocks, anti-Trump ranting is Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s safe spaceComment: Thirty years on, the pain of Tiananmen still haunts Chinese families like mineOn the ground in Tiananmen Square 30 years after the massacre that crushed democracy protests\u0026#39Wild camping\u0026#39 scheme criticised for being too cosy is dropped by Government Justin Trudeau says \u0026#39gender equality is under attack\u0026#39 in swipe at Donald TrumpSummer solstice 2019: Everything you need to know about the longest day of the yearRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat happened inside the Trump banquet?

Once you have fixed sites it’s not wild camping.”UK Wild Camp on Monday announced a “rethink” of the scheme, admitting that it had “inadvertently kicked over a hornet’s nest”.“We thought that running a booking scheme for entry-level wild campers, one that would provide them with the security and legitimacy that currently causes them concerns about camping wild, would be understood and welcome by the wider group,” it said. “We now see this is not the case.“With this is mind, we are going to suspend our service and have a rethink about how we might revise it. We won’t describe any future version of our service as ‘wild camping’ because for many of you that specifically means free and unplanned camping.Nor are we likely to stray into a debate around relaxing the laws on wild camping, because we now understand this is a highly charged area.”Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump visit: Jeremy Corbyn snubbed by Donald Trump after Labour leader requested meeting - live updatesBrexit latest news: James Cleverly pulls out of leadership race as party poised to change rules to narrow fieldInternational community urged to act as number of Ebola cases hits 2,000Army medic who attacked wife \u0026#39blames mental breakdown after Manchester bomb attack\u0026#39Kim Jong-un criticises Mass Games in unprecedented blast at national gymnastics performanceComment: With Labour on the rocks, anti-Trump ranting is Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s safe spaceComment: Thirty years on, the pain of Tiananmen still haunts Chinese families like mineOn the ground in Tiananmen Square 30 years after the massacre that crushed democracy protestsJustin Trudeau says \u0026#39gender equality is under attack\u0026#39 in swipe at Donald TrumpSummer solstice 2019: Everything you need to know about the longest day of the yearRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat happened inside the Trump banquet?

Chinese students abroad were also urged Monday to assess the risks involved given tightened visa restrictions.Beijing has gone to exhaustive lengths to prevent commemorations of the crackdown in which hundreds of unarmed civilians, and possibly more than 1,000, were killed when China sent tanks and troops into Tiananmen Square to crush a student-led movement.Mr Pompeo\u0027s intervention on Monday night triggered a response from Beijing\u0027s embassy in Washington. A spokesperson at the embassy said in a statement that whoever attempts to patronise and bully the Chinese people... will only end up in the ash heap of history.The spokesperson said Mr Pompeo had used the pretext of human rights for a statement that grossly intervenes in China\u0027s internal affairs, attacks its system, and smears its domestic and foreign policies.This is an affront to the Chinese people and a serious violation of international law and basic norms governing international relations. The Chinese side expresses its strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to it.The Chinese statement referred only to the political incident of the late 1980s, and said China\u0027s government and people long ago reached the verdict on it.China\u0027s human rights are in the best period ever, the embassy said.China is firmly committed to the path of peaceful development and to the development of human rights in China and the whole world, and has made significant contribution to the international human rights governance. This is a fact that is recognized by all unbiased people.Please review our commenting policyBrexit latest news: James Cleverly pulls out of leadership race as party poised to change rules to narrow fieldDonald Trump visit: Jeremy Corbyn snubbed by Donald Trump after Labour leader requested meeting - live updatesInternational community urged to act as number of Ebola cases hits 2,000Army medic who attacked wife \u0026#39blames mental breakdown after Manchester bomb attack\u0026#39Kim Jong-un criticises Mass Games in unprecedented blast at national gymnastics performanceComment: With Labour on the rocks, anti-Trump ranting is Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s safe spaceComment: Thirty years on, the pain of Tiananmen still haunts Chinese families like mineOn the ground in Tiananmen Square 30 years after the massacre that crushed democracy protests\u0026#39Wild camping\u0026#39 scheme criticised for being too cosy is dropped by Government Justin Trudeau says \u0026#39gender equality is under attack\u0026#39 in swipe at Donald TrumpSummer solstice 2019: Everything you need to know about the longest day of the yearRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat happened inside the Trump banquet?

You should know that it means the children, aged from six to nine, cannot go to school for six months – it’s a forced exercise,” he said.Meanwhile rumours continue to swirl about a purge of senior members of the regime.Kim Yo-jong, Mr Kim’s sister, sat beside her older brother at the Mass Games after being out of the public eye for more than 50 days.Reports had suggested that she had angered her brother for failing to anticipate the failure of the summit with President Donald Trump in Hanoi in February.Kim Yong-chol, a diplomat who was instrumental in talks with the US, also reappeared on Sunday, refuting rumours that he had been sent to a political re-education camp.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump visit: Jeremy Corbyn snubbed by Donald Trump after Labour leader requested meeting - live updatesInternational community urged to act as number of Ebola cases hits 2,000Brexit latest news: James Cleverly pulls out of leadership race as party poised to change rules to narrow fieldArmy medic who attacked wife \u0026#39blames mental breakdown after Manchester bomb attack\u0026#39Comment: With Labour on the rocks, anti-Trump ranting is Jeremy Corbyn\u0026#39s safe spaceComment: Thirty years on, the pain of Tiananmen still haunts Chinese families like mineOn the ground in Tiananmen Square 30 years after the massacre that crushed democracy protests\u0026#39Wild camping\u0026#39 scheme criticised for being too cosy is dropped by Government Justin Trudeau says \u0026#39gender equality is under attack\u0026#39 in swipe at Donald TrumpSummer solstice 2019: Everything you need to know about the longest day of the yearRamadan 2019: Fasting, prayer and how Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranWhat happened inside the Trump banquet?

The computer itself had received rapturous reactions of cheers and applause – but the crowd was very quiet when the price of the stand was announced.The stand is intended for the new Mac Pro, the most powerful computer Apple has ever made.As with previous versions of that computer, it comes in a modular design.

In fact you could just look at the title, “Tipping Point”, an apt summation of where the UK is at thanks to the efforts of Fox and his disreputable friends.\u0026nbspThe report shows that the UK experienced a 13 per cent decline in FDI projects in 2018 against a 4 per cent decline across the rest of Europe. The UK’s share of all European projects slipped to 17 per cent. That’s the lowest level in two decades.\u0026nbspThe decline in manufacturing investment was particularly notable - it recorded a stunning 35 per cent fall.\u0026nbspBut the digital side is great, right? They\u0027re gagging to invest in that, and digital is, of course, the future!\u0026nbspThing is, even in that sector the figures are nothing like as rosy as Fox portrays them.\u0026nbspThe report says the UK’s market share in this area fell\u0026nbspto 23 per cent. This\u0026nbspshouldn’t come as a surprise to Fox and his colleagues. EY first flagged signs of a challenge to the UK’s leadership last year when its 27 per cent growth was significantly behind the 33 per cent recorded across the continent as a whole.\u0026nbspCare to take a stab at what’s causing figures that a responsible government (I know, I know) ought to be deeply concerned about? It’s pushing it to award a gold star to those who said Brexit because it’s screamingly obvious, as the report makes clear.\u0026nbspUnlike Fox, I’m going to be honest with\u0026nbspthe numbers. EY asked a panel of 400 investors about the impact of that godawful mess he played a major role in creating and 5 per cent said they had cut their investment. However,\u0026nbspthat was counterbalanced by 5 per cent increasing it. Where’s the problem then? Some 15 per cent had put their plans to hold, double the previous year.\u0026nbspThe investment, jobs, future prosperity etc,\u0026nbspis still available for the UK. But EY says that it will “require engagement with investors to address their concerns” before it is released.\u0026nbspThe farce of a Tory leadership battle currently taking place isn’t going to help with that, nor is the fact that the front runner is Boris Johnson, a man, remember, who infamously once said “f**k business”.\u0026nbspFox is correct that the UK has proven attractive to investors from the US. But his highlighting that glosses over yet another troubling finding by EY: It performed badly with most of the other main sources of investment cash, notably the fast growing economies that Fox and his “global Britain” pals say will pour in to replace what is lost through severing the link between us and our former friends and allies across the channel.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour Party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the Industrial Revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three-quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The fund shrunk by £600m in just the last month, including £187m withdrawn by customers with the rest made up by the tumbling value of its investments.A request to withdraw £250m by Kent County Council led to all withdrawals to be suspended on Monday for at least four weeks to “protect” investors, Mr Woodford’s firm said.It marks a new nadir for a man feted in the City as someone who could consistently deliver big returns for large numbers of retail investors.Mr Woodford has commanded multimillion-pound pay packages over the years, including the £37m he shared with his firm’s chief executive Craig Newman in January despite a dismal year.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti-Donald Trump protesters gather with a Trump baby blimp flying over Parliament Square for a protest against the US president\u0027s state visit to the UKQueen Elizabeth II views a display of US items of the Royal collection with US President Donald Trump and US First Lady Melania Trump at Buckingham palaceLiverpool\u0027s players celebrate with the Champions League trophy on board a parade bus after winning the final against Tottenham Hotspur, in Madrid the night beforeFans gather in Madrid ahead of the all-English club Champions League Final between Tottenham and LiverpoolRacegoers during Ladies Day of the 2019 Investec Derby Festival at Epsom Racecourse, Epsom.Jofra Archer celebrates taking the wicket of South Africa\u0027s Aiden Markram during England\u0027s opening ICC Cricket World Cup match at the Kia Oval in London.

We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford’s multi-decade track record remains compelling – but we don’t underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford’s recent performance.“The suspension is understandably frustrating, but it’s important to remember that the value of your investment will be dependent on the share prices of the portfolio’s underlying holdings, which are not directly impacted by the suspension.”Mr Woodford\u0026nbsphas faced criticism because of some of his\u0026nbspinvestments in unlisted stocks are riskier and harder to trade, making them more difficult to manage in a fund where investors have the right to withdraw their money daily.Hedge funds run by women outperforming those run by men, data showsQuestions will be raised as to whether Mr Woodford’s\u0026nbspfund was a suitable investment for a local authority such as Kent County Council.The City watchdog said it was in contact with\u0026nbspWoodford\u0026nbspInvestment Management “to ensure that actions undertaken are in the best interests of all the fund’s investors”.Daniel Godfrey, an adviser to fund management groups, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Mr Woodford was “one of the finest fund managers that Britain’s ever produced, although clearly he is having a dark and terrible moment.”He believes Mr Woodford could bounce back. “There could be a new dawn and it’s not necessarily the end,” he said.“It’s clearly a very dark and difficult moment for Neil Woodford and his business and there may well have to be a hit to valuations to get rid of some of the unlisted holdings. But from there it’ll still be probably a reasonably big fund.“It could well be the case that in five years’ time, we’re looking at it and anyone who bought when it reopens will have had a great performance.”Woodford Investment Management said: “After consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the Fund’s assets, we have ... come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of all investors in the fund to suspend the issue, cancellation, sale, redemption and transfer of shares in the fund.“Following an increased level of redemptions, this period of suspension is intended to protect the investors in the fund by allowing Woodford, as previously communicated to investors, time to reposition the element of the fund’s portfolio invested in unquoted and less liquid stocks, in to more liquid investments.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Commercial building was worst-hit, with firms reporting the steepest fall since September 2017.Civil engineering work was also depleted, with May’s fall marking the longest period of decline since the first half of 2013.Meanwhile, housebuilding was the only area where output increased, though growth was softer than last year’s average.Purchasing activity also declined, recording its largest fall since September 2017.Amid the gloom in the sector, business confidence levels slumped to a seven-month low.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said it was concerning to see forward-looking measures such as new order numbers weaken.“The delay of Brexit until a flexible deadline of 31 October\u0026nbsp– and current major uncertainties over what will happen then – is worrying for construction companies as it threatens to prolong uncertainty and fuel an ongoing reluctance of clients to commit to major construction projects, particularly in the commercial sector as well as infrastructure.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It may not be down to their university.”Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, the regulator for the higher education sector, told The Independent: “There are a number of avenues students can pursue if they are not satisfied with the quality of the teaching they receive or other aspects of their course.“It may well be that students raising concerns and complaints either informally or formally can bring about changes, but clearly it is important that students are able to escalate these concerns if a resolution cannot be found.”Last week, a government-commissioned review suggested that tuition fees should be cut to £7,500.An NUS spokesperson said: “The Augar\u0026nbspreview confirmed that fees are too high, and accepted that students are accruing unsustainable levels of debt within the current system. It is little surprise this affects their perception of value for money.“Students do have clear rights under law, and the report of the settlement does indicate a way students can seek recourse.”Last year, the County Court of Central London ruled in the university’s favour and ordered Ms Wong to pay £13,700 of Anglia Ruskin’s legal costs.\u0026nbspBut the university’s insurers wrote to the former student following the hearing, without reference to the university, offering to settle her £15,000 claim, plus the payment of her legal costs.A statement from Anglia Ruskin University said: “We do not support their decision and have informed them that we consider that they acted negligently and against the university’s interests.”Vivienne Stern, director of Universities UK International, said: “The vast majority of students have a positive experience and the UK ranks number one in the world for international student satisfaction, with 91 per cent\u0026nbspsatisfaction.“All universities in the UK are regularly reviewed by the Quality Assurance Agency. To be a registered university in the UK, an institution must provide a high-quality experience for students. This means that all UK universities offer a very high standard of education.She added: Universities provide students with the tools and experiences they need to be successful but cannot guarantee a particular career path: students have a responsibility to work hard and take initiative.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among millennials, the figure rose to 79 per cent.The Labour Party revealed on Monday that it had commissioned a study on the impact of a four-day working week for millions of public sector workers.Working hours fell steadily from the start of the Industrial Revolution until the 1980s but have since levelled off.If the historical trend had continued, workers would be putting in about 33 to 34 hours per week but in reality three-quarters of people work close to 40 hours.The results come as politicians, trade union leaders and employers increasingly examine the feasibility of a four-day working week, a debate sparked by fears that accelerating automation will push many people out of employment.Britons work the longest hours but a four-day week is not the answerBritons work some of the longest hours of all developed nations but productivity growth has been among the slowest. Proponents of a shorter working week say that workers who do fewer hours are often more productive.Pawel Adrjan, UK economist at Indeed, said: “Time will tell if workers’ enthusiasm for the four-day week ever makes it the norm in the UK, but the idea has shot up the agenda of politicians, academics and even some employers over the last twelve months.“Demands for flexibility and worklife balance are also increasing, so employers who want to attract and retain the best staff will need to take an imaginative and flexible approach to how they organise their people.”On pay transparency, Nordic countries have long taken the lead. In Sweden for example, citizens can request the tax returns of any inidual, allowing them to ascertain that person’s income.Openness has been credited with reining in excessive pay at the top of the income distribution. Sweden’s tax agency is also one of the most trusted in the world.Income inequality has grown steadily in the UK for several decades with the top 1 per cent of households now collecting around 8 per cent of pay, compared to 3 per cent in the 1970s.Average chief executive pay at FTSE 100 firms is now 147 times that of the average worker.four day week\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It comes with a range of new features, including a dark mode that turns the entire operating system black.Apple said the new update will arrive for the public in the autumn. Users can sign up to the public beta to get it early, receiving work-in-progress versions of the software in July.But developers were given access to it as soon as the keynote was finished, allowing them to download it from Apple\u0027s website and launch it on their phones.That option came with a specific warning, however, cautioning users that downloading the new update could cause damage to any phone it is added to.Created with Sketch.

That time around, Apple had focused on performance and efficiency, and it was clear in the very first builds that were released to developers.Last year, Apple also allowed developers to download the update as an over-the-air release, letting the phone download and update itself. It also made it relatively easy for anyone –\u0026nbspeven people who weren\u0027t registered developers –\u0026nbspto download it, since any phone could be given the ability to do so.With iOS 13, Apple is not offering that option at all. Instead, it is requiring users to plug into iTunes – the app it killed during the same event – and use that software to download the update and then push it onto the phone through a wire.That option is available to anyone who is a registered Apple developer, which costs $99. Apple will check that anyone attempting to download it has one of those accounts, and won\u0027t allow phones that belong to anyone else to get hold of it.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it will still be able to use iOS 13, Apple said.Not every phone will get access to every new feature in the software update. For instance, Apple spent some time talking about the updates to its Memoji characters – which allow people to make cartoon versions of themselves and use them in messages and elsewhere – but they require the A9 chip to work, which first came with the iPhone 6s.The company did not say which features or changes meant that the older devices would be unable to keep up.Last year, Apple said that every iPhone that could support iOS 11 would also get iOS 12. But that update focused on performance improvements and stability, with this year\u0027s update bringing more brand new features that presumably rely on more processing power.The new update will arrive in the autumn, Apple said, though users can sign up to get hold of an early test version next month. Developers can download the software now – though Apple has advised them that they may be best not to.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will instead have a music app, a podcast one and a TV app, it said.The Music app looks largely similar to the old iTunes app. But it removes all of the features that were not supporting music, instead focusing on songs, either stored locally or through Apple\u0027s own streaming service.Apple has been looking to encourage its users to sign up to its streaming services, which currently include Apple Music and will soon bring TV too.Created with Sketch.

And with new developer technologies, users will see more great third-party apps arrive on the Mac this fall.”Some had worried about how the Mac would continue to sync with iPhones or iPads without using iTunes. But Apple said that would be handled by MacOS itself, with options showing in the finder menu rather than in the iTunes app.Apple reveals new Mac Pro, its most powerful computer everThat will include other features such as the ability to use an iPad as a second display for your Mac.It also brings a new technology called Project Catalyst, which will allow developers to turn their iPad apps into Mac apps.

Only one couple will take home the cash prize.Among this year’s 12 hopefuls (though there will be many more) are a beauty therapist, a semi-pro rugby player, and a ballroom dancer.\u0026nbspAs usual, Caroline Flack will take on presenting duties.Here are the biggest talking points from episode one, and you can also check out our live blog as the show happened below.\u0026nbspWith every new series of Love Island,\u0026nbspa few new catchphrases\u0026nbspemerge. Last year, of course, there was “loyal”, “sort”, “pied off”, etc. But no one has ever tried so hard to make a catchphrase happen as Lucie, who just one episode in\u0026nbspis already uttering the word “bev” approximately every six seconds. Please stop, Lucie. Nobody understands what you mean.He may yet surprise us, but all early signs points towards Anton being this year’s Adam, AKA a terrible human being. Already, he has gone behind Amy’s back to try and persuade Lucie, despite her expressly stating her lack of interest, that she does, in fact, fancy him. Not to mention the fact that a picture emerged, before tonight’s episode even aired, of the 24-year-old wearing blackface.Accusations of racial biasAnton’s heinous photo is not the only race-related issue surrounding the show. Former contestant Marcel Somerville tweeted to point out the frequency with which black contestants were picked last. “This is mad!!!! #LoveIsland flash backs! Black guy, black girl and mixed race guy all left unpicked. Mad!!!” This isn’t the first time this has been raised either. Last year, contestant Samira Mighty was oft-overlooked – though it’s a depressing bias that exists in the real world too: in 2014, according to Gal-Dem magazine, the dating website OkCupid found that black women received the fewest messages out of all its users.Two new contestantsThere’s no rest for the wicked on Love Island. Just as everyone had been (un)happily coupled up, two new men arrived – Curtis and Tommy, the latter of whom is boxer Tyson Fury’s brother, and is built, as the actor Dax Shepard would put it, like a brick s**t house. No doubt he’ll be the cause of much heartache, mugging and pieing (sp?) in the weeks to come. \u0026nbspRead our live blog for all the updates on the\u0026nbspfirst episode as it happened.Meet the 12 contestants heading into the Love Island villaWhy it\u0027s time to stop hate-watching Love IslandThis year\u0027s line-up is considerably more erse than it has been in previous years. When I was on Love Island, there was a lot about me being the only dark skinned girl, said last year\u0027s contestant Samira Mighty. I think it would be great to see a lot more races in there.A lot has been made, too, of the inclusion of Iranian Instagram star Anna Vikili,\u0026nbspwho has been dubbed, by some,\u0026nbspthe show\u0027s first plus-size contender. Actor and body image campaigner Jameela Jamil begs to differ. The producers of Love Island think this slim woman counts as their new token \u0027plus size\u0027 contestant? she tweeted. Are they drunk?This year\u0027s Love Island has some big shoes to fill.\u0026nbspThe 2018 edition was the most popular programme in ITV2\u0027s history, with\u0026nbsp4.3 million people tuning\u0026nbspin to the final episode to root for Dani and Jack. (Don\u0027t tell us you wanted Megan and Wes to win.)Just a few minutes left of Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them\u0026nbspon ITV2, and then it\u0027s Love Island time.

It will release it in autumn as well as a differently sized version that will be meant to be mounted in racks.Apple repeatedly bragged that the specifications inside the computer made it unprecedented and that it could be upgraded to include performance never before seen on a Mac.The previous version had not gone updated for five years, and Apple said it had made severe mistakes in the design of that computer that stopped it from releasing new updates. It had avoided those issues with a new design and a tremendously capable cooling system which includes an enormous fan, it said.As well as claiming the computer was its most powerful ever, Apple said it was its most configurable version, too. Apple will let people add a wide variety of different hardware to their computer, as well as the new display.During the reveal, Apple showed off how the new computer could easily deal with multiple streams of very high quality raw 8K footage. It also showed off how the computer could run Logic, its music composing and recording software, with hundreds of different tracks playing at once.It can also comes with wheels, so it can be pushed\u0026nbsparound on people\u0027s floors.Both the computer and its display have an unusual set of holes in the back, assembled in a lattice pattern, which it said will allow heat to leave more easily and achieve higher performance. Thermal problems had been central to the issues with the previous Mac Pro.The Pro Display XDR was revealed at the same time, and takes its name from the extreme dynamic range that Apple says it can show. It can be bought separately from the Mac, allowing it to be used with Apple\u0027s MacBooks, and includes a host of new technologies as well as a stand that allows it to swivel and attach to the wall.The display will cost $4999, which it claimed was cheaper than the other professional displays it was comparing it with. Like the computer, it will come out in the autumn.Apple revealed the new Mac Pro at its Worldwide Developers Conference, where it also showed off a host of brand new software updates.Created with Sketch.

The fund shrunk by £600m in just the last month, including £187m withdrawn by customers with the rest made up by the tumbling value of its investments.A request to withdraw £250m by Kent County Council led to all withdrawals to be suspended on Monday for at least four weeks to “protect” investors, Mr Woodford’s firm said.It marks a new nadir for a man feted in the City as someone who could consistently deliver big returns for large numbers of retail investors.Mr Woodford has commanded multimillion-pound pay packages over the years, including the £37m he shared with his firm’s chief executive Craig Newman in January despite a dismal year.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti-Donald Trump protesters gather with a Trump baby blimp flying over Parliament Square for a protest against the US president\u0027s state visit to the UKQueen Elizabeth II views a display of US items of the Royal collection with US President Donald Trump and US First Lady Melania Trump at Buckingham palaceLiverpool\u0027s players celebrate with the Champions League trophy on board a parade bus after winning the final against Tottenham Hotspur, in Madrid the night beforeFans gather in Madrid ahead of the all-English club Champions League Final between Tottenham and LiverpoolRacegoers during Ladies Day of the 2019 Investec Derby Festival at Epsom Racecourse, Epsom.Jofra Archer celebrates taking the wicket of South Africa\u0027s Aiden Markram during England\u0027s opening ICC Cricket World Cup match at the Kia Oval in London.

We are advocates of long-term investing and think Woodford’s multi-decade track record remains compelling – but we don’t underestimate the disappointment investors must feel with Woodford’s recent performance.“The suspension is understandably frustrating, but it’s important to remember that the value of your investment will be dependent on the share prices of the portfolio’s underlying holdings, which are not directly impacted by the suspension.”Mr Woodford\u0026nbsphas faced criticism because of some of his\u0026nbspinvestments in unlisted stocks are riskier and harder to trade, making them more difficult to manage in a fund where investors have the right to withdraw their money daily.Hedge funds run by women outperforming those run by men, data showsQuestions will be raised as to whether Mr Woodford’s\u0026nbspfund was a suitable investment for a local authority such as Kent County Council.The City watchdog said it was in contact with\u0026nbspWoodford\u0026nbspInvestment Management “to ensure that actions undertaken are in the best interests of all the fund’s investors”.Daniel Godfrey, an adviser to fund management groups, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that Mr Woodford was “one of the finest fund managers that Britain’s ever produced, although clearly he is having a dark and terrible moment.”He believes Mr Woodford could bounce back. “There could be a new dawn and it’s not necessarily the end,” he said.“It’s clearly a very dark and difficult moment for Neil Woodford and his business and there may well have to be a hit to valuations to get rid of some of the unlisted holdings. But from there it’ll still be probably a reasonably big fund.“It could well be the case that in five years’ time, we’re looking at it and anyone who bought when it reopens will have had a great performance.”Woodford Investment Management said: “After consideration of all relevant circumstances relating to the Fund’s assets, we have ... come to the conclusion it is in the best interests of all investors in the fund to suspend the issue, cancellation, sale, redemption and transfer of shares in the fund.“Following an increased level of redemptions, this period of suspension is intended to protect the investors in the fund by allowing Woodford, as previously communicated to investors, time to reposition the element of the fund’s portfolio invested in unquoted and less liquid stocks, in to more liquid investments.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ms Allen herself has said that the party may not continue under the Change UK banner.After growing tensions within the fledgling outfit, it is understood that Tuesday afternoon’s meeting will result in the departure of some key iniduals who have come under fire internally from colleagues.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

This would be a really, really big step backwards for us.”On the accumulation of meat on conveyor belts, Mr Spellman said: “Some of that poultry will be carrying campylobacter without a doubt, and some salmonella. The more contact they have with other bits of meat, the more contamination will spread.”And he added: “This practice of stacking the boxes up like that, with the bottom of the box on the chicken that’s underneath, makes it appear to be a comparatively innocent and harmless practice. It isn’t. It’s dangerous.”The real reason Trump is here is to carve up the NHSHere’s what Donald Trump has to say about BrexitNHS could be ‘on the table’ as part of US trade deal, ambassador saysTory MP becomes 13th candidate to enter leadership contestGove ‘prepared to delay Brexit until end of 2020 to block no-deal’For the programme, entitled ‘The Truth About Chlorinated Chicken’\u0026nbsprecruited an undercover reporter for a job at the plant in Texas, owned by Tyson Foods, America’s biggest poultry producer.She said: “On several occasions, I saw supervisors touching chicken with bare hands. The hygiene in the plant, it was just really kind of a shocker.”Criticism has grown that ministers will bow to US pressure to accept chlorine-washed chicken after Brexit, in their desperation for a trade deal with Washington.At the weekend, Woody Johnson, the US ambassador, made clear it would expect UK markets to be opened up to US agricultural products, in a trade deal already being “lined up”.“American products would come over. You give the British people a choice. If they like it they can buy it, if they don’t want it they don’t have to buy it,” he said.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Commercial building was worst-hit, with firms reporting the steepest fall since September 2017.Civil engineering work was also depleted, with May’s fall marking the longest period of decline since the first half of 2013.Meanwhile, housebuilding was the only area where output increased, though growth was softer than last year’s average.Purchasing activity also declined, recording its largest fall since September 2017.Amid the gloom in the sector, business confidence levels slumped to a seven-month low.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said it was concerning to see forward-looking measures such as new order numbers weaken.“The delay of Brexit until a flexible deadline of 31 October\u0026nbsp– and current major uncertainties over what will happen then – is worrying for construction companies as it threatens to prolong uncertainty and fuel an ongoing reluctance of clients to commit to major construction projects, particularly in the commercial sector as well as infrastructure.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So, what happens during the religious month and when is Eid al-Fitr in  Ramadan began on the evening of Sunday, May ,  and continued for  days until June , .The beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar – meaning it depends on when the new moon is sighted.Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.The night of power or night of decree is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.Its thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan - the , , ,  or th.The holiday of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month.This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.A common greeting is Ramadan Mubarak, which means have a blessed Ramadan.Eid al-Fitr  will be celebrated on Wednesday, June , .It is marked on the first of Shawwal, after the month of Ramadan.Eid al Fitr is a festival when Muslims thank Allah - they are forbidden to fast on this day.The word Ramadan comes from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar-ramaḍ, which means scorching heat or dryness.Fasting is obligatory for adult Muslims, except those who are suffering from an illness, travelling, are elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating.The fast is from dawn to sunset, with a pre-dawn meal known as Suhur and sunset meal called Iftar.Muslims engage in increased prayer and charity during Ramadan.Ramadan is also a month where Muslims try to practice increased self-discipline.As well as fasting - abstaining from eating and drinking during daylight hours - Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Koran throughout the month, before the holy festival of Eid al-Fitr.Ramadan is seen as a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship.Muslims are expected to rigorously follow the practices of Islam and this includes fasting - which teaches people how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate.The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the Suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is the Iftar.In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims also increase restraint, such as abstaining from sexual relations.The act of fasting is said to cleanse the soul by freeing it from worldly activities, in addition to the abolition of past sins.The eating of dates usually breaks the fast at sundown.Following that, the usual practice is to adjourn for prayer and then the main meal is served.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here is everything you need to know about it.Eid or Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, which is a month of fasting that starts on May  and finishes on June  in .It is an important religious holiday for Muslims and is a day when they are not permitted to fast.Eid kick-starts the month of Shawwal, which begins with a feast to end the period of fasting.However, some Muslims do observe six days of fasting during Shawwal- as this period is considered equivalent to fasting all year round.It is believed that good deeds are rewarded  times in Islam and so to fast for the  days during Ramadan and a further six days during Shawwal fulfils the obligation of fasting for the entire year.The celebration of Eid is a public holiday in many Muslim countries, but is not one in the UK, despite a campaign for it to be recognised back in .During Eid, Muslims will often purchase new clothes for the occasion, and take part in festivals and celebrations.Many will wake up early to pray at a mosque or outdoor prayer venue.Gts and cards are often exchanged among friends and family.Eid means celebration and Mubarak means blessed, often Eid Mubarak is used as a greeting over this period.In , Eid starts on the evening of Wednesday, June , and finishes the following day.The dates can be adjusted slightly nearer the time due to lunar sightings and changes each year.This is because the Islamic calendar - known as the Umm al-Qura calendar - is based on the moon’s cycle, whereas the Gregorian one is determined by the sun.As the two don’t align, the Islamic dates move back by around  days each year.As well as Eid al-Fitr, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha.Eid al-Adha will begin on the evening of August , , which falls in the middle of the th and final month in the Islamic calendar.The celebration revolves around when Allah appeared to Ibrahim in a dream and asked him to sacrice his son, Ishmael, as a sign of his faith.It’s similar to the Christian and Jewish stories in which God asked Abraham to sacrice his son Isaac, but spared him from doing so.During this time, Muslims traditionally sacrice animals, in Britain this is done in a slaughterhouse, and the meat is ided up among friends, family and the needy.It finishes on the evening of Thursday, August ."},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now! px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   appgrab.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" And dont forget to check out the all-new Sun Mobile app - with an amazing facelt, the new app allows you to follow your favourite topics and build your very own homepage.Updated round the clock, its packed full of pictures, videos, and breaking news and showbiz exclusives you really cant find anywhere .  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is the Cabinet.It is not only Theresa May who let down Conservative Party voters, members and supporters.She was abetted and supported by her Cabinet. In this country we operate a system of collective responsibility and it is not good enough for Cabinet members now to claim they held a dferent view or would have done things dferently.How can it be right that Cabinet Ministers, who were complicit with the failed Brexit polices of Chequers, the Withdrawal Agreement and the subsequent betrayal of Brexit, credibly seek to claim they are an acceptable choice for this role They were sat around the top table when decisions were made and must take responsibility for them.I would sup with a very long spoon indeed with those who are complicit but now claiming they can offer the Party new leadership and direction.The British public are not stupid and our Party members know what they are voting for.They wont be fooled by those born-again ‘Leavers’, who trumpet their devotion to Brexit even though they have done nothing for the last three years to advance theof British sovereignty.The British public and our long suffering Party members know where the responsibility for the greatest breach of trust in our democratic institutions lies.After three years of being repeatedly told that ‘nothing has changed’, the time has come for ‘everything to change’.The British people are desperate for our country to leave the EU on st October. They are crying out for leadership which will put the country and our people first.The European Elections clearly reflect that and anybody who has knocked on doors or engaged the public in recent times knows that.We simply must move on and move out of the EU and fast.And in doing so we must move into a trade negotiation as has been outlined through numerous proposals over the last  months.Unfortunately Theresa May’s Cabinet showed themselves unwilling to listen to detailed proposals which would have a delivered the genuine Brexit the public voted for.So now the priority is to exit the European Union and move forward to negotiating a future relationship with protects British interests and keeps open the global prizes and benefits of Brexit which the British people voted for.Ministers who claim they are pro-brexit have failed to stand up for the . million who voted to leave and make that robust case to deliver the referendum mandate.The people were promised we would have left the EU months ago and that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’.Having danced to the tune of the tune of the EU, spent billions of pounds on ‘no deal’ preparations, our country must just get on and leave the EU.Too many people in our political class lack confidence in our country and trust in the public. They have sought the comfort of the EU making our laws rather than making the decisions themselves. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.They expected the UK to leave the EU on th March as they were promised. Every day longer we remain in the EU adds salt to that wound.The governing class has broken trust in our politics.The British people voted to take back control and for Britain to be free, independent and self-governing again. Our destiny is as a global beacon of free trade, not a satellite of the EU.The Conservative Party must quit the navel-gazing and stop the rot of this Brexit betrayal.Those of us who believe in our Country and people, who respect our democratic and political freedoms, will continue to stand up for our liberty to make sure the days of betrayal are over.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I take them at their word - so on that basis the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead.Instead, I have a pragmatic three-step plan - a plan to deliver Brexit in a way that protects citizens of the UK and the EU, delivers certainty to businesses, and maintains the integrity of our United Kingdom.No more preicating. No more fearmongering. And no more limbo. Just compassionate and decisive action that demonstrates leadership.My first step will be to take sensible measures to enshrine certain agreements into law, and to protect our people.I will immediately introduce key legislation to address this.First, I will introduce a citizens’ rights bill. EU citizens who have built lives here, and UK citizens who have made their homes in the EU must have the weight of uncertainty lted from their shoulders.Second, I will introduce a bill that locks in the mutually beneficial measures that have already been agreed between the UK and EU.This will cover areas like citizens’ rights in Gibraltar, our sovereign bases overseas, security and intelligence-sharing relationships, transport, data, and medicines.It is in everyone’s interest to put these agreed arrangements in place, and I believe many MPs would support this, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.The second step is to give businesses and industry the confidence and certainty they need to plan for a managed exit. I want them to be able to invest, hire, and innovate with renewed optimism.So we will ramp up preparations for our managed exit, focusing efforts on delivering alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border with the EU.Our continued strong bond with Northern Ireland will be protected.There are some sensitive sectors that rely upon ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, like automotive and aerospace. I know how important these are, and we will propose specic regulatory agreements with the EU for these.For other industries, like medicines and agri-foods, we will seek specic customs agreements on tarfs and non-tarf barriers. This will protect trade in the most vital goods and services but allow us to embrace new free trade deals around the world.At the core of this work will be open communication to Parliament, the public, and EU colleagues about progress, to build an environment of confidence and certainty. Parliament will receive regular updates, and households and businesses will receive communication from government that provides clear information about our managed exit.Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it’s what parliament expects, and it’s what the public deserves.The third step will be to lead a delegation of UK Ministers to meet with the EU Council and the proposed new EU Commissioners, to talk directly about the wide-ranging preparations we are making for a managed exit on October .Discussions will culminate in a UK EU summit, in September, in Belfast and Dublin, where the EU Council and proposed Commission will be invited to agree which measures we will all accept, to ensure a properly managed exit.As Prime Minister, I will not advocate an extension of any kind, and it will be clear that in all circumstances the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. With comprehensive arrangements in place, we will be prepared for any eventuality.We owe it to the country, and to our strong democratic tradition, to fulfil the instruction that our voters gave us.I am a passionate, pragmatic and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the EU. We can demonstrate to the world that the UK remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness and democratic leadership.

It’s unacceptable how these people are living.”The house is let by a private landlord and run by a manager who claims she rented it to a family-of-eight. But persistent complaints from neighbours reveal that the house is still being used by up to  people from overseas. When the overcrowding persists, despite constant warnings and inspections, Harrow Council brings a prosecution.In Darwin, Lancashire, disabled letting agent Paul Ainsworth-Lord is also battling with tricky tenants.He comes in for shocking verbal abuse and intimidation after visiting a tenant, Dean, in a two-bedroom semi-detached house in Darwen, who’s fallen into two months’ arrears on his rent.A smirking Dean swears at Paul and threatens him with violence whenever he visits the property to try to resolve the situation.During one encounter, Dean is in tears before getting angry and threatening to assault Paul. “You f****** sorry excuse of a man,” he shouts at one point, before calling Paul, who limps and walks with a stick, a ‘cripple’.Paul says: “For him to stoop low and start making personal comments about how I walk…. I’ve battled an aggressive disease, at least I can walk, I didn’t think I’d be able to walk.”“I’ll shove that stick so far up your arse, you’ll look like a human kebab, you p***k” the tenant threatens, then shouts at the older man that he will ‘flog’ him until his le’s not worth living.In South London, business woman Pauline Ivaldi is facing financial ruin after incurring thousands of pounds in costs when squatters moved into her shop five months ago.“They’re clever and clued up and know exactly what they’re doing. It’s surprising the toll this takes on you,” Pauline says. “The shop is full of squatters. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.”Pauline can’t run her business from the premises she has leased for  years – she uses them as a production kitchen and base for her catering company – and is distraught that the squatters have trashed the place.With the end of her lease only weeks away, she has to resort to expensive legal action to get the squatters out or face additional fines for not handing it back to the owners with vacant possession.When she finally gets into her property as the squatters are preparing to leave, Pauline is devastated by the state of it - littered with junk, debris, a piano, bikes, shopping trolleys, bags and suitcases, white goods and countless mattresses.“They’re wrecked this place. I feel like blowing my stack. I am so angry,” she says, after one of the squatters, a scruffy, unkempt, overweight middle-aged man boasts that they’ve been putting the rubbish out for her. Another rips a power shower from the wall in front of Pauline to expose leaking pipes and blocked drains, then asks her for £she wants him to leave the shower in.The squatters leave after being served with a legal notice but Pauline incurs thousands of pounds in costs because an extensive clean-up and repair operation takes her beyond the date when her business lease ended.She says: “The squatters will not win. If I break down and cry, then they do win, and they can never be allowed to win. The new Channel  series delves into the dark side of Britain’s housing crisis, looking at the toll taken by a stretched rental market on tenants and landlords, and offering a shocking insight into a crisis which is only getting worse and with huge human costs.Three million new social homes must be built in England over  years to solve the housing crisis, according to a report by the housing charity Shelter. It says . million homes are needed for younger families who cannot afford to buy, and face a letime in expensive and insecure private renting.In the absence of enough social housing, private landlords have become frequent providers of rental property.Yet one in five homes in this country is sub-standard.Nightmare Tenants, Slum Landlordsstarts tonight at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am ashamed of France.Louis Mexandeau, a former Veterans Minister, said: We had hoped that France would honour the sacrice of tens of thousands of Allied soldiers in the appropriate manner.And Jean-Vincent Brisset, of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs, said the snub was an example of his ‘irresponsibility’ and lack of interest in projecting France on the international stage.Genevieve Darrieussecq, France’s Armed Forces Minister, said Mr Macron would be attending other events, and that presidents and other heads of state had previously attended the event every ten years.I think it’s a question of planning, and it’s not that simple for the President to do everything, from a financial point of view, she said.An Elysee Palace spokesman said Mr Macron would be travelling to England for D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth on Wednesday – June .He will then spend D-Day, June , at other events in Normandy at Franco-British and Franco-American events also attended by dignitaries including Prime Minister Theresa and US President Donald Trump.The spokesman said French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe would be in charge at Juno Beach.The only world leaders confirmed as attending at Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, and Charles Michel, his Belgian counterpart.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the family does not get the support it needs.Thousands of kind-hearted Sun readers have already signed Vickey’s letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond demanding he properly funds services — such as respite and overnight support — for parents with disabled children.We hope more of you will show your backing by signing the letter today, because the Lewis family are not an isolated case.Mums and dads up and down the country feel unable to look after their disabled children adequately because they are so exhausted — and they are frustrated at being let down by a system that is meant to help them.When we surveyed parents, just four per cent said they felt they had the support to safely care for their child.More than half have been treated by a GP for depression, anxiety or stress.Ollies grandad Dave helps out when he can, but the family are far from an isolated case - they need your helpIndependent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic Society And a huge  per cent of children have gone without therapies, such as physio and speech and language help, meant to improve their lives.This lack of support starts right from diagnosis — with parents being left alone to come to terms with devastating news.They are then left to care for children with complex needs — often through the night — for months or years without any help or respite.This care is often emotional and stressful, and sometimes physical and back-breaking, too.At my charity, Contact — which works with families of disabled children — we hear all the time from those who have to fight for even the most basic provision.Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.These families are morally — and legally — entitled to help from local authorities, but it is just not forthcoming.It does not need to be like this. All the families want is a little amount of support to enable them to care safely for their child at home.They want a chance to go shopping, a moment to catch up on sleep or have a bath, or time to spend with their other children.This is not about pity or sympathy for disabled children.The families we work with cherish every day spent with their children, who bring real joy and have so much to offer. Instead, we are calling on the Government to help tackle the problem of the lack of support they are given.I have worked in the field of disability for  years, so I know that services have never been perfect.But cuts to budgets, combined with a  per cent increase in the number of children classed as disabled over the past decade, means we have reached a critical point — one where we need to decide what kind of country we want to be.We are talking about some of the most vulnerable children in society, and also children who have the potential to contribute a lot.This is not a campaign based purely on emotion, compassion or wanting to do the right thing, although those are all important.There is a hard-headed economic case here, too. Without putting funding back into services for disabled children, we can guarantee the taxpayer will be faced with a bigger bill in the long-term.That is because when families break down, children can end up in care or needing expensive crisis intervention from local councils or the NHS.Our families are amazing. When the chips are down, people can be remarkable.But most do not want to be amazing, or superhuman — they want an ordinary le.As Sun readers, you can give families up and down the country a real shot at that.Sign Vickey’s letter using this link, and ask which of our potential leaders will be first to agree to Give It Back.Amanda Batten is chair of the Disabled Children’s Partnership, a coalition of  leading charities, and CEO of Contact.Jane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic SocietyWe want as many people as possible to sign the open letter calling on the Government to give back the millions that have been cut from support for disabled children.

Dr Fox said that the exact details of what regulations would be up would be for inidual governments to decide - and that he wouldnapost be seeking special protections above and beyond normal international treaties for the health service. Speaking to LBC, the Tory Minister said: One of the main exemptions that exist in trade agreements is for governments to regulate their own public services and what it tends to say, notwithstanding anything in this agreement. Governments have absolute right to regulate their own public services and in our case, the NHS and that wouldn’t change, you would imagine that would be a standard provision in any treaty as it was for example in the treaty that we just negotiated with Canada.  But pushed onthat meant that the NHS would be a no go zone for private companies Dr Fox said it would be something for each inidual future government to decide. Dr Fox said: Well the government would determine, the government of the day of whatever Party would determine exactly what the regulations were round the NHS, what you would not have would be any interference with the NHS unless the government of the day wanted it to be so and that’s how it should be, it should be that governments have the right to regulate their own public services in the national interest.  Speaking to protesters outside Parliament yesterday Jeremy Corbyn says he will aposfight with every last breathapos to save the NHS from the clutches of US healthcare firms. But Dr Fox  criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for not attending the state dinner with Donald Trump.He said: He should have been there, this was not just a political visit, this was a state visit, where the President was here as a guest of the United Kingdom, he was there as a guest of her Majesty the Queen last night. I It was a celebration of the sacrices that were made, and of course we are seeing the D-Day celebrations over the next few days, it was a celebration of the sacrices we have made together to protect our freedom and our democracy, and it’s a shame that you had a leader of the Labour Party who seemed to go out of this way to want to insult the President of the United States. A Labour Leader who doesn’t believe in maintaining nuclear weapons for the State, you do wonder what it is he is actually committed to.    The International Trade secretary described Ivanka Trump, who he sat next to at the dinner as an extremely intelligent, charming, pleasant and well-informed dinner partner.But in controversial remarks, Dr Fox said he sided with Mr Trump in a long-running dispute with London Mayor Sadiq Khan .In the past, Mr Trump has challenged Mr Khan to an IQ test and been critical of his response to the London Bridge attack in . Before landing Mr Trump tweeted: Sadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly aposnastyapos to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone-cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me. Kahn [sic] reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC, de Blasio, who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event, I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now. A spokesman for Mr Khan said the childish insults should be beneath the president of the United States. But Mr Fox said he sided with President Trump in the dispute. He said: I think it was very ill-advised of the Mayor of London to say that the red carpet should not be rolled out for the Leader of the free world, for the President of our closest ally, the United States, a country which is a guarantor of our security, a country which is our single biggest trading partner and which is our biggest investment relationship in the world.

We are SO proud of Harry and everything he achieved in his le and the legacy he has created to help others. We miss him so much. Hamilton was among a number of stars from the sporting world to lend support to Harryaposs Giant Pledge.  The Formula One ace dedicated his win at the Spanish Grand Prix to the youngster, while Mercedes sent the trophy and one of Hamiltonaposs cars to Harryaposs Surrey home for the youngster to enjoy. In a remarkable gesture, Hamiltonaposs Mercedes team hastily arranged for one of their Formula One cars to park outside Harryaposs home in Redhill. The youngster, cradled in his father Jamesapos arms, was then shown around Hamiltonaposs car by a Mercedes employee. Given the acceleration of his illness, it marked the first time he had been outside in three weeks. Harry was also presented with Hamiltonaposs winning trophy from the race in Barcelona, and a pair of the world championaposs racing gloves. Hamilton recorded a video message of support for him to watch too.  I cannot describe how much it means to us all that Lewis won the race for Harry, and then dedicated it to Harry, too, his father James said at the time. At a tremendously dficult time in our lives, this has provided us with a big boost, and a big smile. Harry couldnapost believe that Lewis Hamilton was talking about him, and had dedicated the race to him. He now thinks that Lewis is his absolute best friend, which, for a five-year-old boy, is amazing. Harry loves cars, and although he is frail, he was asking about the exhaust pipe. He is very inquisitive, so that is typical of Harry, asking questions and getting involved. Mercedes have taken us to a much-better place in a dark time.  The world champion had been alerted to his plight after he received a video message ahead the race in Barcelona. Hamilton said in a Instagram post at the time: You are such a strong boy, I wish I was as strong as you, I wanted the world to see how strong you are.

The Queen told the diners that the two nations remain bound by the strength and breadth of our economic ties, as the largest investors in each other’s economies. Mr President, as we look to the future, I am confident that our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us. Tonight we celebrate an alliance that has helped to ensure the safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades, and which I believe will endure for many years to come.

She claimed a profile piece made her out to be “a bitch” and “neurotic woman”, who had driven her husband mad. Writing in July , she said: “I submit that I am a perfectly normal person whose marriage went wrong mainly because of financial problems.    “The custody proceedings over my children brought out the worst in my husband... he became paranoid.” Lord Lucan had tried to prove his we had mental problems, but lost the case and accumulated large debts. And, in another letter, Lady Lucan wrote: “If I was suffering from anything at all it was the normal fears which any mother would feelshe could see no security for her children.”  Lord Lucan disappeared in November, , aged .

The child, who as not yet been named, fell from a ride at Lightwater Valley theme park near Ripon, North Yorkshire, on Thursday. He remains in hospital, but is breathing on his own and his condition is said to be improving. Speaking yesterday, businessman Ian Cunningham said he was sorry for the upset and anxiety the incident has caused the boyaposs family. He added: As a father myself, I can imagine only too well how it must have felt for everyone involved when the incident happened, and in the hours since.    Our thoughts and concerns are completely focused on the child and his family at this dficult time. I would like to say how sorry I am personally for the upset and anxiety that this incident has caused. We are committed to offering our full support to the family. Mr Cunningham said Health and Safety Executive officials are in the process of establishing the cause of the incident. Witnesses have described how the boy fell around - feet leaving his hysterical mother stuck in the car on the ride above. Visitors to the park are said to have screamed in horror and shouted for someone to help the child.    Members of the public ran to his aid along with park staff before paramedics and an air ambulance arrived. Mark Charnley, who was queuing for the Twister with his -year-old daughter while enjoying a half-term break, said he looked up to see the boy hanging backwards outside of the actual carriage before he plunged to the ground. Yorkshire Air Ambulance attended the scene and transported the boy, who was said to be conscious, to Leeds General Infirmary. The ride, which is described on the theme parkaposs website as full of seriously tight turns, was shut down immediately but the rest of the park remained open.    The exact nature of the boyaposs injuries arenapost known. Mr Cunningham said: Everyone at Lightwater Valley is very pleased to hear that the condition of the young boy who fell from our Twister ride last Thursday is improving.

Lisa Shaw, , of Morecambe, Lancashire, was unhappy with her droopy eyes, so underwent a non invasive procedure Fibroblast, which promised to lt and tighten her eyelids. But instead of getting the wide eyes sheaposd always dreamed of - she was left with burnt, crusty eyelids and is now scarred for le. Lisa, a stay-at-home mum, now wants to warn others to stay away from the procedure. She said: There is nothing I regret more than getting Fibroblast done.  It promised to fix my eyes, but instead it completely ruined my face. Now I have permanent pink scarring and my confidence is shattered. Since her twenties, Lisa hated her eyes and longed to have them re-shaped and widened. She says: My eye shape made me miserable. I hated how droopy and squinty-looking they were. I wanted to change the entire shape of them so that theyaposd look more open. In September , Lisa was forced to undergo corrective surgery after a breast enhancement left her botched.    Reluctant to go under the kne again, Lisa searched for a non-invasive procedure to fix her eyes. Years later, in June , Lisa discovered Fibroblast - which promised to tighten and lt her eyelids. The procedure uses a plasma pen that causes a controlled superficial burn to restore the skinaposs natural elasticity. Lisa said: I paid £ for the procedure and booked my appointment at a beauty salon. It was incredibly cheap compared to an actual eye lt which costs around £,. When I arrived at my appointment, I was told I didnapost need anaesthetic and that I wouldnapost experience any pain. But when the nurse started the treatment, I felt the skin above my eyes burning. It was the most excruciating pain Iaposve ever felt.  She was literally searing my skin off, and I could smell it burning. I started to scream in pain, but she told me that it was normal and not to panic. Finally, after  minutes, the treatment was complete. But when Lisa looked in the mirror, she was horried. She said: My eyelids were charred brown, they looked absolutely disgusting. And there were awful black dots burnt into the skin. I told the nurse that something was wrong, but she insisted it was all part of the process. But it didnapost seem normal to me.  Reluctantly, Lisa left the salon and went home. Later that day, her eyes swelled up and were watering constantly. The following day, they had fused shut. She said: I was forced to stay in bed all day, I couldnapost do anything. I called the salon to complain, but despite my concerns, they told me my eyes needed time to heal. The next day I could finally open my eyes, but when I saw my face, it was so swollen. I looked like the Elephant Man.  Meanwhile my eyelids were crusty and gross, I couldnapost stop crying. Scared of anyone seeing me, I was forced to stay at home for weeks. Over the next six weeks, scabs formed on Lisaaposs eyelids. She added: Once the burnt bits fell off, I was left with bright pink scarring. People thought I was wearing pink eye shadow. It was humiliating. After making numerous complaints to the salon, Lisa was advised to wait six months for her eyes to fully heal. But by January , her eyes were still scarred. She said: I was absolutely distraught.  I stopped going out with my friends and avoided socialising. Now I have to use special make-up that is made for people with burns. In March this year, Lisa was awarded £, in damages in an out-of-court settlement with the practitioner. Lisa is hoping to undergo revision surgery to remove the scarring, which is expected to cost £,. She said: I was relieved I got the compensation, Iaposm going to put the money towards my revision surgery. I want to warn people to stay away from Fibroblast.  Itaposs shocking that a medical practitioner could botch such a procedure, especially in such a sensitive area. I couldnapost believe I trusted someone to do this to my face. Iaposve since discovered that anyone can do the procedure, and all they need to do is take a two-day course. I want to warn people to think twice before undergoing non-invasive treatments, sometimes they can be just as dangerous as surgery. My confidence has now been ruined. Iaposll never be the same again.

It’s the secret to a happy marriage. We danced, even when he was so ill we danced. Dancing is the answer. Everybody should dance.” From home to school to the war, these are some of the memories and reflections of grandparents and great grandparents around the country for a unique video project. Called The Silent Generation, the crowd-sourced project aims to preserve and share the stories of an older generation and record the wisdom and advice of those who have already clocked up many years of le.  The creators of the initiative are encouraging Brits to sit down with their elderly relatives, friends or neighbours, and get them reminiscing about their lives, on camera, through a series of questions. Themes include growing up, work, love, war, triumph and tragedy and words of wisdom. Among the videos already uploaded onto The Silent Generation website is one man’s memories about joining the D-Day landings with his best friend. Answering the question, ‘who was your best friend’, he says: “Billy Breach. He and I became good friends. “As we were getting a bit older, we knew we were going to get called up for the army. Billy Breach said to me, ‘I’m not going until they call me up’.

They found him a job in the Ministry of Defence as a messenger, with one leg, walking about. “We always used to say, ‘ you had lost one arm, they’d have found you a job as a window cleaner’. Another woman remembers how she was evacuated to Melkham, Wilshire, the day before war broke out. She says: “We were all together with our little tags on, and our bags. “I was put in this house, with another girl called Joan, with a woman who hadn’t got children. “She was very nice, Mrs Hudd. She worked at the hospital as a volunteer. We shared a double bed in a room. Looking back I think she might have used us a bit, rubbing the kitchen floors and things but then that was OK. “But this other girl, for some reason she was quite a vindictive girl and used to say things about my mum, which was daft when she didn’t even know her. “The house mother heard her and made her move.

Amy Sharp, , had been texting a man she knew as aposJamesapos on the dating app for three weeks before she agreed to meet him for a drink around pm last Wednesday. Amy claims when she arrived a total of four men got out of the white Mercedes and approached her through the dark pub car park. Amy rang aposJamesapos, only for one of the menaposs phones to light up as he walked towards her - prompting her to realise the account had used fake photos to lure her in.  After fleeing and calling the police, Amy claims cops told her aposJamesapos admitted heaposd used a fake name and pictures as he was scared his girlfriend would find out - but denied showing up with the group, leading to the case being dropped. The hair and make up artist believes she would need to have been attacked for the police to do anything and is calling for the law to be changed about catfishing. Catfishing is using a fake profile or identity to form a romantic relationship with someone online. It is not currently illegal in the UK. Amy, from Chard, Somerset, said: I was really shaken up.    With all the Ted Bundy stuff, I know itaposs really extreme, but you just donapost know how far itaposs going to go. The more I think about it the scarier it is. It was obviously calculated.    I donapost want to know what would have happenedI got out that car.    At the end of the day, there were four blokes there. Iaposm ft and nine stone.    Letaposs be honest, they werenapost all coming for a drink.     Four blokes going to meet one girl on her own - I donapost know what they were planning on doing. They werenapost all going to take me for dinner.    Iaposm not saying he was going to murder me, but at the end of the day, he gave me a fake name.    Something was going to happen but I donapost know what.    Amy, who claims sheaposs been single for ages, initially met James on Tinder and found him totally normal.    The pair even spoke over the phone every day for three weeks before agreeing to meet for a drink in Tiverton, Devon, which was  minutes from Amyaposs house. Amy pulled up in the pub car park and spotted the white Mercedes that aposJamesapos had told her to look out for - but with four men waiting in it.Amy said: It was all totally normal. He had an Instagram account, WhatsApp, all his photos were the same person. He did something to do with accounts in an office.We spoke on the phone most days for three weeks. If I ever meet somebody I always chat to them on the phone first because you can get a better feel for them. We got on well. He seemed really easy going and told me about his job, his family and his ex-girlfriend. On the night, he was in the car he said heaposd be in, a white Mercedes, and I parked opposite.    I saw him get out the car with three other people.    It all happened so fast. [At first I thought] he looked like him, but afterwards I found out he used fake photos because he had a partner.   All of the men started walking towards my car. I rang his number and his phone lit up and I drove off.    Fleeing the scene quickly and counting her blessings that she had gone in her car, Amy was so shaken up she called her friend and then the police. That night, she couldnapost stop thinking about what would have happenedshe had got out of the car. He texted her after asking why sheaposd fled, to which she responded asking how he couldaposve possibly thought it was okay to bring three other men with him on their first date. At first he said he brought a friend with him because he didnapost know I was genuine, then it came out it was a fake name, Amy said. He then said aposokay, fine, Iaposm Matthew. I used a fake name and fake pictures because Iaposve got a girlfriend and I didnapost want her to knowapos.  He then pleaded her not to contact police as he told her: Iaposm disgusted with my thoughts and behaviour tonight. To me he was going to do something really dodgy. I told him aposyouaposre sick. Donapost contact me againapos and blocked his number. I was so angry. I phoned a friend and said to her that the weirdest thing just happened. The more I thought of it I realised it was really dodgy. After calling , Amy claims the incident was passed on to Devon and Cornwall Police before it was then passed on to her local force Avon and Somerset Police.    Avon and Somerset Police informed Amy it was not a crime to use a fake profile on dating websites.    She says a police officer texted her to say he had spoken to the man, who admitted he wasnapost called James but claimed he was the only one in the car.    Amy has now questioned why it wasnapost looked into further and is hoping to raise awareness of catfishers on dating apps.    Amy said: The police asked aposdid he touch you apos They said unless heaposd actually attacked me, he hadnapost committed a crime.    Thereaposs no law against using fake names online and using fake profiles. He basically saidI was under  it would be illegal, but because Iaposm  itaposs not.  Whathe went to meet another girl and convinced her to get the bus or train somewhere  I had a car to get away in.   I said to the police aposwhatheaposd done this before  Isnapost there a law against luring girls under  pretences apos Heaposs lied, there wasnapost one person in the car. I canapost believe they just believed what he said and didnapost check with me. I replied saying aposthataposs a complete lieapos, and they didnapost get back to me.Since posting her warning online, Amy claims she has been aposbombarded with messagesapos from people who have also been victims of fake profiles - some even claiming to have been speaking to the same man. Amy said: Iaposve been bombarded with messages from women saying theyaposve had similar with a dferent guy.    People need to know this is going on.    Iaposve met loads of people off the internet, I always tell someone where Iaposm going. Iaposd never meet someone down a lane.    Devon and Cornwall Police were contacted for comment but had no record of the incident and said it was a matter for the victimaposs local force, Avon and Somerset Police.

Russiaaposs Ministry of Defence confirmed to state-run agency TASS: Another test-launch of a new Russian interceptor missile was successfully conducted. “After a series of trials, the new interceptor missile successfully completed the task by striking an assigned target with precision. The missile defense system is reportedly in service with the Aerospace Forces, and is designed to protect against attacks of aerospace attacks.  TASS indicated that the tests were linked to earlier trials at Sary Shagan last year. These involved the upgraded PRS-M interceptor missile which is described as “much faster and deadlier than its predecessor”.This new missile is a development of the older T which “previously flew several times faster than a bullet and accelerated within seconds to  km per second, making it the worldaposs fastest missile”, according to gazeta.ru“The modernised versionaposs speed has already approached  km per second.”    This is . miles per second and . miles per second respectively.“The new productaposs kill zone is practically one and a half times greater in terms of altitude and range,” reported  gazeta.ru  in analysing the PRS-M.“Interception of enemy ICBM warheads is now assured at an altitude substantially higher than  km . “The missile carries a nuclear warhead of several kilotons.” "},{"url":null,"title":"self conscious mum trying lose","story":"NewsSelf-conscious mum trying to lose weight finds adorable three-word note from sonKelly McCarron has been trying to improve her health but was constantly jumping on the scales at homeShareCommentsByLucy NotarantonioKelly-Ann Mills:,  JUN NewsKelly and her -year-old son Jack \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA self-conscious mum was left a sweet note from her son who noticed she was weighing herself every day. Mum-of-two, Kelly McCarron has been trying to improve her health by changing her diet and exercising from the start of this year along with husband Ruairi. The couple, from Perth, Australia, have been trying out new ways to lose weight that involve  hours of fasting and eight hours of eating in moderation per day. Stay at home mum, Kelly, admits she eats for comfort and steps on the scales more than she should - her son Jack, , has changed her feelings towards the scales. The -year-old said: My husband and I have been trying to get fit since January, Ruarai has lost nine kilos but I havenapost.    I used to weigh kg but now currently weigh kg so Iaposve put on kg in the last two years which I understand isnapost obese but I would like to get back to my old self. I am pretty hard on myself but when you have two children to look after, you end up putting yourself last. Jack and Ayla, , were being super helpful around the house last week which I found strange as they have never done this before. But I thought I will enjoy it whilst I can, and then the following day I saw a piece of paper on the scales, I was going to throw it in the bin.    It read aposDoes it matter apos and I then realised, it absolutely doesnapost - I noticed that I would mainly weigh myself when I am not feeling great about myself. I have decided to keep the message on the scales and monitor my weight by taking pictures of myself to see the progression rather than religiously weighing myself. Sometimes my daughter steps on and copies me and I tell her immediately to get off and remind her she doesnapost need to weigh herself. The note from Jack made me realise, I should take my own advice and stop it also.  She added: I asked Jack why he wrote it and he said to be nice, but secretly I think it is because he wants a new Nintendo game. Either way, his note really has helped me feel better about myself, I donapost need to lose weight it is just a healthier le I am after. So there is no need for me to beat myself up and step on the scales daily - I shared the picture online because I thought there might be another woman out there who needed to see it. I want to get back to being healthier because I remember how much better I felt physically and mentally. I also think itaposs an important part of everyday le but now I will bare in mind not to dwell on my weight and to focus on being fitter.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter.

The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

world of mis-information are we assessing the evidence and forming an opinion based on agreed facts and an understanding formed through unbiased scrutiny ldquoOr do we simply exist within an echo

development projects in the area.At the end of July, the group set off to host a development camp for young Malawian males to build confidence and leadership skills.Activities will include construction work to restore an elderly womanrsquos home damaged by recent floods.And the group will also take time to hike up Mount Mulanje to reach the highest peak in Malawi.After planning the expedition last summer, the group has need to raise over pound each for the project.Denis Robson, Graham Little, Thea Panter, John Little and Sophie Wilson will team up with five Malawian leaders to host the pilot programme.Through the Rotary Young Leadersprogramme, the Scottish Borders group was able to link up with the Rotary Club of Limbe, to plan the project.Travelling to Zomba, in Malawi, the objective is to develop leadership skills for both the --year olds taking part and the young Borderers involved.Innerleithens Denis Robson, the group leader, has been involved in making connections with the Zomba district for many years.Denis told us: ldquoOur focus is on creating a sustainable model for educating people to become young leaders.ldquoRYLA is a worldwide programme offered by the Rotary to improve the leadership skills of young men and women.ldquoWe are delighted to be taking part in the pilot RYLA Malawi programme and hope to encourage the local rotary clubs to adopt the model in future years and make it sustainable.ldquoWe have an amazing set of Border Exploration Group leaders and graduates who will be able to help share their skills and confidence to the Malawian youths.ldquoAnd I hope they develop a great international understanding that they can have throughout their lives.As part of the development project, the group will work with local skilled people to rebuild a storm damaged home in Liwonde.Malawi often is hit by extreme weather conditions and the recent Cyclone Idai was no exception.Additionally, the programme will include a Climate Mitigation project on the Zomba plateau.Working alongside the Forestry Department the team will prepare a site to plant  trees in October.And educate the community living in the forest to preserve the highly valued resource.It is hoped that these daily activities, together with evening workshops, will develop skills in teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, critical thinking, communication and leadership.A self- assessment questionnaire will be completed before and after the event covering self-confidence, communication skills, practical and leadership ability and general happiness.A presentation to parents s will be given by the young Malawians on the final day explaining what benefit the camp has had for them and how they can apply the experience for the benefit of the community.President-Elect Bernard at the Rotary Club of Limbe:ldquoThe RYLA-Malawi Program will offer an opportunity for Malawian youth to nurture and grow their leadership skills and potential, through boot camp interaction with their Scottish counterparts.Although the team from Scotland will pay their own travel costs, they are still fundraising to meet the expenses of running the RYLA development camp.Sponsorship is needed to cover the cost of all food, accommodation, transport and building materials for the construction projects.For one Malawian youth to attend the camp it costs pound, and the volunteering group hopes to seek sponsors for all .Denis added: ldquoWe are seeking sponsors for the  Malawian youths at pound each.ldquoAnd I would like to thank the Rotary clubs of Selkirk, Melrose, Biggar, Innerleithen and Peebles for all their support.Anyone interested in sponsoring the project should contact Denis Robson on  or

version prepared by Brahms as a piano duet for four hands on one keyboard, on this occasion the Melrose Music Societyrsquos Petrov piano.They gave a performance of scintillating musicality and power,

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

brother as part of a Preston Athletic Youth FC group that had travelled to the park in Yorkshire for a weekend football tournament.However, as reported in last weekrsquos Courier, the entire group of  people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the bar resulted in security being called and, in a separate incident, police were called to the park to arrest a young woman on suspicion of assault.Sophiersquos dad Michael Carruthers, a coach for the club who splits his time as a part-time support worker and caring for seven-year-old Sophie, from Blawearie Road, Tranent, has now hit out at the ldquodisgusting behaviour of security staff at the park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9918363.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a-guide-to-some-of-scotlands-best-beer-gardens","story":"Relaxing with a cold drink and enjoying the sunrsquos rays is a rare but welcome treat for us Scots.

After gorse was taken away and sand imported from other parts of the site, the new th, known as lsquoHillhouse,rsquo replaces the former par- th hole.To create a better link between the th green and the former th fairway, Kimber has also built new teeing grounds near the th green to enable play towards the new th fairway from a completely dferent angle and achieve a right-to-left dogleg hugging the railway line.With the alterations ready for the start of the  season, the new th ndash which at  yards features an undulating green, pot bunkers around the green and a view to Arran looking back down the hole ndash has already proved popular with members and visitors.Bob Anderson, Greens Convenor at Kilmarnock , said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the new th hole, it couldnrsquot have looked better. It is a well-designed signature par-, with a nice yardage and improves the enjoyment of playing Barassie without the walks.ldquoVisitors or potential members were previously coming to Barassie and it was too long, overall. Over the years we have tried to get the playability up but retain the enjoyment and the new hole has already proved tremendously popular with all the members.The total yardage for the par- course has reduced by eight yards to ,, while the standard scratch for all levels remains the same.Coupled with other initiatives such as rough reduction, the course changes have also helped Barassie to grow membership in these challenging times.The club, which was founded in  and the course finally laid as  holes in , now has a total membership of over ,.Claire Middleton, General Manager at Kilmarnock , added: ldquoWe are thrilled with the new par- th hole. Paul Kimber and his team managed not only to meet our budget and a tight schedule but, even more importantly, meet membersrsquo expectations.ldquoWe look forward to another great golfing season and our members and visitors enjoying the course changes.Barassie, which also boasts a -hole layout, counts former Amateur champion Gordon Sherry and fellow ex-Walker Cup winning players Jim Milligan and Jack McDonald among its current members.The club also offers improved facilities in the clubhouse and professionals shop, run by Gregor Howie.Visit the website to find out more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lochranza CentreWelcome to Arranrsquos oldest and youngest tourist attraction.The Vikings called Arran the mysterious Island, sometimes there, sometimes not depending on the weather.

Nobody can say they are happy with our main civic space as it is.ldquoResidents and visitors understand that we canrsquot just leave it as it is.

What standardised assessments are doing is helping shape that confidence.\"There has obviously been a big debate about P, but frankly that has been more of a political debate than an educational debate because again, in year one, we have had over  per cent participation of P pupils in the standardised assessments and no real dficulty in the implementation of all of that.\"Mr Swinney said the SNSAs were an improvement on previous testing systems which were more demanding and not relevant to the Scottish curriculum.He added: \"Frankly, the P assessment debate has got a bit of traction because of politics. If people were so troubled about P assessments they should have been complaining about what  out of  local authorities have been doing for a long, long time and to a greater intensity than the Scottish National Standardised Assessments.\"Opposition politicians dismissed Mr Swinneys version of events arguing the assessments were \"a shambles\".Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said: \"This is dangerous hubris from an education secretary who has learned nothing from three years of gaffes, U-turns and climbdowns.\"Teachers say the assessments tell them nothing, parliament instructed Mr Swinney to drop them in P, an education committee report says they lack clarity of purpose, and educationalists say they leave us with no way to measure progress in literacy and numeracy.\"Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said it was \"simply not true\" to say the tests were introduced without any dficulty.She added: \"The recent evidence provided to Holyroodrsquos education committee makes clear that there were signicant issues raised by teachers and their professional associations, most especially about P tests, and several educationalists, including those with international experience, raised some doubts about whether there was clarity of purpose. It is also clear there have been concerns raised within several local authorities.\"Neither is it true to claim that the controversy is political. It is surely about the best educational interests of young people which is why the education committee chose to examine the issue in great detail.\"Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said it was clear Mr Swinney intended to press on with the assessments \"irrespective of teachers, educationalists and others who oppose his single minded utter disregard for the facts\".And Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said members were ldquounconvinced about the need for the assessments.He said: ldquoOur survey revealed the implementation created signicant issues in many schools and authorities around consistency of approach, IT challenges, and in particular the breaching by  out of  local authorities of national guidance on how the assessments should be delivered.\"P assessments have been shown to be inconsistent with a play based approach to learning and they need to go. In S the assessments are largely administered after pupils have made subject choices and been allocated to qualication streams so what is the point of them, other than to create a workload issue for teachers \"As far as the EIS is concerned, the educational benefit of SNSAs is unproven.Sue Palmer, from the charity Upstart Scotland, whch has opposed P testing, saidthe debate was lsquopoliticalrsquo because opposition parties had listened to the arguments against standardised assessments.She said: \"Therersquos a mass of evidence that standardised assessment of academic skills at such an early age is developmentally inappropriate, unlikely to provide reliable results and affects teaching practices in ways that can cause long-term damage for some children. This applies whether the data is collected at a national or local level.\"The UK is the only country in Europe that sends its children to school before the age of six and itrsquos only because of our absurdly early school starting age that we assume such young children should be cracking on with the three Rs.\"As countries like China and Singapore have recently recognised, the growing incidence of mental health problems among children and young people make it far more important to emphasis health and well-being during the early years.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mep-set-for-leading-role-in-european-parliament","story":"Mr Smith, , who was first elected to Brussels in , is today expected to become head of the -strong European Free Allianceof small Nationalist parties.Mr Smith is the longest serving member of the EFA, and it is the SNPrsquos turn to hold the position.More signicantly, as president of the EFA , Mr Smith is automatically vice-president of the larger Green-EFA bloc, which has  of the  MEPs in the parliament, giving it a powerful say in decisions.:Top SNP candidate open to an independent Scotland joining the euroMr Smith told an EFA meeting: ldquoHaving been here for  years, I will put myself forward for president of the group - to continue your good work and to make a commitment to stopping Brexit.He later told The National: ldquoThis is me making a commitment to the group, but it is also the group making a commitment to us.ldquoIt is a commitment in terms of lsquowe want Scotland to stayrsquo.

Dundee United legend Frank Kopel is another high-profile victim of dementia. Kopel, who was part of Manchester Unitedrsquos European Cup-winning squad in , was a defender for Dundee United in the s and s.He was  when he was diagnosed with early-onset dementia and died aged  in .Other footballers who have gone on to develop dementia include former Celtic striker Chris Suttonrsquos father Mike Sutton and former England player Jeff Astle.Former Scotland manager Ally MacLeod, who played for teams including Wolves, Blackburn and Ayr United, died in February , aged , after spending nearly  years battling Alzheimerrsquos disease.The scientists analysed  brains from former athletes with a history of dementia ndash seven footballers and four rugby players ndash and found that signs of CTE were present in around three-quarters of the cases.In many cases, however, researchers also noted other complex and mixed degenerative brain pathologies existing alongside CTE.As a result, the signicance of the CTE in dementia patients remains ldquouncertain, the researchers said.The report concluded: ldquoIn the majority, CTE-NCappears as a co-morbidity rather than the primary, dementia causing pathology.ldquoAs such, we suggest that while CTE-NC might be common in former athletes with dementia, in many cases its clinical signicance remains uncertain.The study is said to be the largest of its kind to date, and experts said it demonstrates the importance of brain donations in scientic research.Dr Willie Stewart, honorary clinical associate professor at the University of Glasgowrsquos institute of neuroscience and psychology, said: ldquoOur findings suggest that, while CTE is prevalent in a high number of the patients we studied, in many cases it is not the primary pathology driving the dementia.ldquoIn other words, while head injury-associated degenerative brain disease is important in these patients, the reality of dementia in former footballers and rugby players is that the disease is more than just CTE, and more complex.He added: ldquoThis work demonstrates the incredible importance of research brain donation to support such detailed examination of the pathology of dementia, and we are incredibly grateful to all the families who have supported our studies in this way.Shearer has previously spoken of his own fears for his health after becoming aware of the possibility of a linkbetween heading the ball and future ill-health.He said: ldquoThis is incredibly important work by Dr Stewart and his team in Glasgow.ldquoFinally, we are beginning to see some progress towards understanding dementia in former footballers and I look forward to hearing more from these studies.The study has been published in the journal Acta Neuropathologica."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-labour-refuses-to-learn-from-its-past-mistakes","story":"Labourrsquos first set back was losing the  Scottish Parliament election, though it still romped home in the Westminster election just three years later. However, in the  Scottish Parliament election the SNP won the previously considered ldquoimpossible majority.So, what did Labour do next  Come the Scottish independence referendum, it urged the Scottish electorate to vote No, which as a Unionist party is only to be expected. However, it opposed independence in a formal coalition with the Conservatives, not only associating Labour with a political brand that has been in decline in Scotland for about  years, but to join in a campaign of hitherto unknown negativity. As Benjamin Franklin wrote, ldquoit takes many good deeds to build a good reputation, and only one bad one to lose it. Moreover, winning the independence referendum did it little good as less than a year later its  MPs were reduced to Ian Murrayrsquos Edinburgh South seat.Sir John Curtice wrote recently in a blog that the SNPrsquos  success was down ldquoto an apparent determination by those who had voted Yes to independence to affirm the choice they had made. Not only did Scotlandrsquos position in the Union now seem less secure than ever before, but Labourrsquos domination of Scotlandrsquos representation at Westminster had been reduced to rubble.While matters improved a little in  with seven Labour MPs being elected, the fact is that even that ldquotriumph increased its vote by only ,. Is this a comeback or a ldquodead cat bounce  Based on the EU election result, allied to many recent polls which suggest that in an election held any time soon, the SNP would win more than  seats again, it looks more like the latter.When a political party does badly, it is always possible ndash indeed arguably mandatory ndash that they identy someone to blame, but this is becoming serial for the Labour Party in Scotland, as since  Jack McConnell, Wendy Alexander, Iain Gray, Johan Lamont, Jim Murphy and Kezia Dugdale have all come and gone to little positive effect.It is all very well to be blaming Mr Corbyn and his advisors for the failure of Labourrsquos EU Parliament campaign, but the fact is that this was a further failure, illustrating the truth of George Santayanarsquos claim that \"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\".Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.THE question about why the UK government should have a say in when Scotland holds another referendum on separation was unwittingly answered by Kirsty Blackman MP on BBC Scotlandrsquos Debate Night programme . Responding to a question on Brexit she said that she was not supporting the will of the people in this case because ldquoLeave was  and stated that it was ldquovery dficult to extricate yourself from a relationship with your closest trading partner.With all its dire warnings of \"clf-edge Tory Brexit\"we left the EU without a deal, it is surely inconceivable that the SNP would advocate holding a referendum without having negotiated a withdrawal agreement and future settlement with the remaining UK. This would make the Brexit negotiations seem like childs play and would tie up our politicians and civil servants for years, preventing progress on other vital legislation. Without detailed co-operation from Westminster, any attempt at a White Paper vision of Scotlandrsquos future would hold as much validity as a slogan on the side of a bus.The SNP has also expressed outrage that some EU citizens in UK were not able vote in the EU election. It wants over-s and EU citizens living in Scotland to be able to vote in an Indyref. If that is its moral position, then logically all Scots living in the rest of the UK and their offspring over , should also get to vote. This would require the UK Government to get all these people identied, registered and systems set up for voting.Holyrood cannot unilaterally impose all of this on the rest of the UK. The Westminster Government has a responsibility to protect its citizens both sides of the Border from any more uncertainty and ision at the very least until the Brexit outcome is clear.Mark Openshaw,Aberdeen AB.AS First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon seeks permission to have another Scottish independence referendum. The wording of the question to be asked has raised its head again, but this should be decided by the Electoral Commission and certainly not the SNP.One question that remains to be answered by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is: Why is Holyrood wasting essential parliamentary time on Indyref when Scotland has important pressing problems in health and education that the SNP has failed to resolve over the last  years Dennis Forbes Grattan,Aberdeen AB.ONE of the more interesting,not unusual, contenders in the Conservative leadership contest is Rory Stewart. If successful he would undoubtedly bring a new style and emphasis to the political scene. The present adversarial style has its merits ndash it can more readily produce the arguments on both sides of an issue as happens in the legalism of the court process ndash but in practice it degenerates into a permanent battle between the main political factions.Mr Stewart would bring a much-needed fresh approach to British politics. He appears to be someone who can listen politely to all sides before coming to a decision ndash resolute without being combative philosophical without being indecisive or dithering.Not only would this approach help to improve the present tarred relationship between the people and the politicians but it could assist in reversing the disdain which many currently have for the political system itself.Is there in all of this a bonus for the Conservatives  Could Mr Stewart rejuvenate the British Conservatives in the same way that Ruth Davidson has rejuvenated the Scottish Conservatives  The Conservative Party has survived as the oldest political party in the world simply because it is notconservative. It has always been willing, albeit sometimes reluctantly, to embrace change. Whether the present Conservative membership is courageous enough to go down this route remains to be seen.David SW Williamson, Kelso."},{"url":null,"title":"waitrose-takes-hundreds-of-products-out-of-packaging-for-waste-reduction-trial","story":"The scheme will provide a dedicated refill zone with dispensers for a range of products, as well as the UKrsquos first supermarket ldquopick and mix for frozen fruit including mango, strawberries and pineapple, the retailer said.: Waitrose to rebrand British ready mealsCustomers will be able to ldquoborrow a box from the store to shop with and thenon their next visit.Waitrose  Partners said the ideas have the potential to save on thousands of tonnes of unnecessary plastic and packaging.Theyare being tested at the store in Botley Road, Oxford, which has been transformed to take hundreds of products out of their packaging for the Waitrose Unpacked trial.The ideas being trialled include a frozen fruit pick and mix Packaged equivalents of the products will remain in their usual areas to create an effective test to seeshoppers change how they shop.The scheme includes:ndash  loose fruit and vegetable productsndash Frozen mango, strawberries, blueberries, cherries, pineapple and raspberries available as pick and mixndash Plastic removed from flowers and plants and replaced with % recyclable craft paperndash A partnership with Ecover providing an automatic detergent and washing up liquid dispenserndash Four wines and four beers available on tap to take home in reusable bottlesndash Four coffees can be ground to take home in a reusable containerndash  products including pasta, rice, grains, couscous, lentils, cereals, dried fruit and seeds available through dispensersThe trial will run for  weeks until August , and the supermarket is seeking as much feedback as possible.Tor Harris, from Waitrose  Partners, said: ldquoWe are determined to build on the work wersquove already done to reduce packaging, and this test will take our efforts to a whole new level as we help the growing number of customers who want to shop in a more sustainable way.: Farmers criticise Waitrose for failing to go Scots with lambldquoThis test has huge potential to shape how people might shop with us in the future so it will be fascinating to see which concepts our customers have an appetite for.ldquoWe know wersquore not perfect and have more to do, but we believe this is an innovative way to achieve something dferent.Ariana Densham, ocean plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: ldquoThis is a genuinely bold step from Waitrose to trial food dispensers so customers can use refillable tubs and jars.ldquoLots of supermarkets are starting to sell loose fruit and vegetables, which is good, but more importantly this kind of innovation could spark a refill culture thatrsquos so desperately needed to cut plastics in mainstream shops.ldquoThe top  UK supermarkets produce , tonnes of throwaway packaging each year, so we need to see other major retailers taking plastic reduction seriously and following Waitrosersquos lead."},{"url":null,"title":"edinburgh-named-as-worst-uk-city-for-traffic-jams","story":"Analysis by sat-nav manufacturer TomTom suggested that a typical rush hour journey in the Scottish capital takes % longer compared with free-flow conditions.London is the second-worst city for congestion with an average extra travel time of %, followed by Bournemouth, Hull and Belfast with % each.:Critics call for ferry overhaul following latest CalMac breakdownOn average, UK motorists driving in peak hours spend an extra five-and-a-half days stuck in traffic each year.Middlesbrough was found to be the least congested UK town or city analysed by TomTom.A -year plan to further improve traffic flow in the town ndash including a new ldquopark and ride railway station ndash was announced in December .Edinburgh was ranked th in the world in terms of congestion.Mumbai took top spot, with drivers facing an average of % extra travel time in the Indian city.Heiko Schilling, head of navigation at TomTom, said: ldquoThe UK was home to nine cities in the top  most congested cities globally.:Stockbridge fire: Residents evacuated after fire guts launderette in EdinburghldquoOverall congestion is up by an average of %in the UK ndash a mild increase but an increase nonetheless.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"charity dog walk to be held at haddo","story":"Employees of Nicol of Skene will be hosting a charity dog walk at Haddo Country Park in July.The event will be held on Sunday, July  at .am.The idea for the event was created through the love for dogs Nicol of Skene employees have and, their partnership with the cancer care charity, Friends of ANCHOR.The charity is one very close to many at Nicol of Skene.Richard Stott, Managing Director at Nicol of Skene, said: “Friends of ANCHOR are a very important charity in the North East of Scotland and unfortunately, many lives have been affected by cancer, our staff included. “The dog walk is a fantastic opportunity to have a great day out to raise money for a worthwhile cause.”Tickets for the charity dog walk cost £ per adult, £. per child and all dogs go free.The cost includes a sandwich, a bottle of water and all dogs participating will receive a free doggy goody bag.

The Forum was established in January  to promote the cause of Fair Trade in Scotland and secure Fair Trade Nation status for Scotland.The SFTF is encouraging other local authorities and public bodies to recognise the International Fair Trade Charter as a common reference document for the global Fair Trade movement.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Junior Doric Verse competitors\"  Society hosts Strichen Festival viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"mp praises extension of apprentice programme","story":"Gordon MP Colin Clark has praised Aberdeenshire Council for #ambitious# plans to extend the Foundation Apprenticeship programme to more school pupils across the local area.The Scottish Conservative made the comments following a visit with Cllr Gillian Owen toan employer in his constituency that has taken on the first apprentice through the scheme.SengS of Ellon part of the Pryme Group, an engineering firm in the Balmcassie Commercial Park, took on Ellon Academy pupil Callum Turnball as a Foundation Apprentice .The FA is a qualication – over one or two years – that let’s pupils gain work experience within one of Scotland’s  growth industries while still attending school.The apprentices spend one day or two half days a week working with a local employer, learning some of the skills required for a future career.Mr Clark said: “SengS is a great example of a growing company here in the north-east of Scotland with world-class skills.“Callum is the company’s first apprentice taken on since Aberdeenshire Council became a Foundation Apprenticeship provider. “The council recently received £million from Skills Development Scotland to develop the programme and encourage more young people into work while they are studying.“Apprentices are in many ways the leblood of industry and governments at all levels should be doing all we can to increase vocational training and job opportunities for our young people.“We are fortunate here in the north-east to have a thriving economy with many good local employers.“The council’s ambitious plans to get more young people into vocational training should be welcomed.”Cllr Gillian Owen, Ellon  District councillor and chair of education and children services at Aberdeenshire Council, said: “FAs provide a unique opportunity for our young people and I hope other local employers will follow the lead taken by Sengs.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Ellon Resource Centre is one of the Aberdeenshire Day Service sites\"  Council day care services praised after inspection viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"oor wullie big bucket trail to visit inverurie","story":"Cartoon favourite Oor Wullie will make his way to Inverurie this summer as part of his charity Big Bucket Trail.The town and local area will house seven sculptures as part of the first ever nationwide trail raising money for The ARCHIE Foundation, the official charity of Royal Aberdeen Children’s Hospital.Across Scotland,  Oor Wullies will be found on the streets of Aberdeen, Inverness, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow.A portion of those have been allocated to Inverurie thanks to the help of local businesses.GPH Builders Merchants, Inverurie Precast, ANM Group, Tarmac, Barra Berries, the Inverurie panto and the town’s Business Improvement District have each sponsored a sculpture, with funds going to benefit sick children in Grampian.Six Oor Wullies will be found in the town, while one will be ready to discover in Oldmeldrum.Derek Ritchie, manager of Inverurie BID, said: “We are absolutely delighted that the town will be hosting a number of sculptures this summer.

When Samaritans first started, for example, homosexuality was illegal.“But people still face the same challenges they did when that first call came in.“When there is no-one  to talk to, we’re there. That’s what is at the heart of the Samaritans – the power of human connection.”Founded on the principle that trained volunteers should answer calls, that has not changed either.And it’s something that strikes very many callers who use the service.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Aberdeenshire Councils Sustainability Committee: Cllr Martin Ford, Cllr Iain Taylor, Cllr Victoria Harper, Cllr Isobel Davidson , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  Council pledges supportto International Fair Trade Charter viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"That’s the equivalent of  days of listening in one year alone. James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch. And in the coming years, the charity will be introducing new methods to provide emotional support including webchat.Today – just as  years ago – every call for help is answered by a volunteer. And to meet demand, the charity needs to recruit at least  volunteers in Scotland in . Anyone can contact Samaritans for free,  hours a day,  days a year. The service is anonymous, confidential and non-judgemental. You can get in touch by calling   or emailing Jo@samaritans.org or write to Chris, Freepost RSRB-KKBY-CYJK, PO Box , Stirling, FK SA. Alternatively, you can find your local branch at samaritans.org branches.There are  across Scotland including Stornoway, which had  contacts last year answered by  volunteers Aberdeen , Dundee ,

I felt like he felt like it was a joke.ldquoBut I didnrsquot and I was really angry with it.The witness said it took five to  minutes for the girl to calm down after the event and described how the youngster was screaming and trying to get away from the accused, who was holding her.The woman also spoke of an incident around the same time of year when she said she saw Dunn moving to put his hand over the childrsquos mouth and nose.The court heard she told police in a statement: ldquoOut of nowhere, Tom saidkids find it hard to sleep you suffocate them by putting your hand over their mouth and nose for a number of seconds until they go drowsy.It added: ldquoI was shocked. It came from nowhere, I just thought it was an odd thing to say.Defence advocate Niall McCluskey put it to the witness that the incidents could not have been so serious since she had left her child in Dunnrsquos care following the tumble dryer incident.She said she disagreed and told the court: ldquoI wouldnrsquot accuse someone or make an accusation like thathellipldquoItrsquos for my child so she can get closure as well.ldquoI wouldnrsquot ly accuse someone of doing that, Irsquom not like that. I know I did make a mistake going back.Dunn, of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, denies three charges of assaulting the child between December  and January .Dunn also denies assaulting a young boy on ious occasions between April  and January  by placing a hand over his mouth and pinching his nose, restricting his breathing.The case, before Sherf Alastair Brown, continues.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch are the lib dems tory lite or truly radical","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Buoyant party must find distinctive policies and a leader capable of commanding the UK stage, writes Lesley Riddoch.Liberal Democrats are suddenly news again – dangerous enough to warrant Labour’s instant expulsion of nose-holding supporter Alastair Campbell but appealing enough to notch up a remarkable opinion poll first. \u2028Last week YouGov put the Lib Dems on  per cent, with the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories and Labour tied on  per cent. Even though that lead evaporated in the latest Opinium poll , they’re still celebrating a first UK top spot in nine years.: Dani Garavelli: ‘I disagree with Jo’ moment a bad start for SwinsonThe good news for the Lib Dems is that English Remain voters have either forgotten their part in imposing university tuition fees and austerity or decided there are bigger Brexit fish to fry. Whatever the reason, the party most used to losing deposits is riding high. But will they be able to capitalise on this opportunity without the weel kent face of Sir Vince Cable at the helm  : Jo Swinson: I will take on ‘independence obsessed’ SNPThe battle to replace him as leader at the end of July is a modest affair compared with the Tories’ -strong line-up. It features just two candidates: Sir Ed Davey and Jo Swinson. Nominations close on  June, the day Theresa May bids a tearful farewell. But at that point the Lib Dems must decide what kind of party they really are – nasty or nice Tory-lite or genuinely radical a one-trick, anti-Brexit pony or a vigorous and serious potential government. It won’t be as easy as it looks. The party’s moment in the sun may finally have arrived but beyond “Bollocks to Brexit” it’s not clear the party has a winning slogan, distinctive policies or a new leader capable of commanding the UK stage.Take Sir Ed Davey, whose radical credentials are surely damaged by taking a gong from the Tories in consolation for losing his seat after the coalition debacle. Sir Ed’s record as energy minister is underwhelming from a Scottish perspective. Subsidies for community hydro and solar  were cut and vital subsea connectors to the Northern and Western Isles vetoed because islanders wouldn’t knuckle down and build vast wind farms tode-risk the project and simply the budgeting process. Even though Alistair Carmichael was Scottish Secretary at the time, the long-awaited Northern Isles cables weren’t built on the Lib Dems’ watch. Mind you, Sir Ed did approve connectors to Norway and Ireland instead. Nice. He also introduced contracts for dferencein place of subsidies for onshore and offshore wind plus marine renewables. Somehow Scots firms have won only a handful of these contracts and a new island-shaped CfD was only introduced last week. Soon after losing his seat in , Ed was knighted and joined the PR firm that represents EDF Energy. EDF had just been awarded the contract to build Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by… Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey. Oh, yes, and Sir Ed supports fracking too. This is what passes for a radical record on tackling climate change in England.Anyway, back to Brexit – doubtless the Lib Dems’ strongest card. Sir Ed wants to use “the Cooper-Letwin process” so the Brexit default is Revoke rather than No Deal on \u2028 October. Whoop, whoop. When the crowd-funded Revoke Article  legal action failed its first hurdle in February , Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine promptly quit. Happily for MPs, all are now legally entitled to press the Revoke button, thanks to the tenacity, vision and co-operative capacity of the original petitioners in the Green, SNP and Labour parties. Without their constancy when the going got rough, Ms Jardine’s colleague Lib Dem MP Tom Brake would not have been able to join the posse in the latter stages and give the Lib Dems a democratic name-check. Poor.Meanwhile Sir Ed’s sole opponent, Jo Swinson, announced her candidacy on last week’s Question Time, taking a pop at the SNP’s failure to close the educational attainment gap. The MP for East Dunbartonshire cited figures from the Scottish Index on Multiple Deprivationwhich suggests only  per cent of children in Govan go on to higher education. This immediately provoked a social media storm, not least from Govan High’s headteacher who cited more recent figures which show the school’s actually doing pretty well. Was this an own goal or just plain baffling  Well, it would be usefula Holyrood statistician could explain how such wildly dfering stats can attach to roughly the same educational cohort. It would also be pointless to maintain that income doesn’t play a shamefully large part in determining access to opportunity in Scotland. But that’s why roughly half the population supports Scottish independence so all policy decisions, tax levers, benefit levels and income streams are under Scottish control, all ability to offload responsibility are at an end and a truly concerted sht of resources can tackle Dickensian levels of poverty, generated by David Cameron’s Con-Dem coalition government. Just for the record, both Sir Ed and Ms Swinson were members – she voted  times for the bedroom tax, five times against raising benefits in line with inflation, seven times for disability cuts and  times for general welfare cuts. But bygones…Even though the SIMD figures do exist, the statistical basis of her Question Time rebuke was dodgy, the “Milngavie air of superiority”was snfy, the “forced breeziness” a little wearing and the choice of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s seat as a target was negative and predictable. If Ms Swinson aims to outdo Ruth Davidson with high octane attacks on the SNP’s record in office, good luck. The SNP isn’t perfect. But politicians in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. And thanks to the Lib Dems’ disastrous involvement with the Tories, shatterproof glass only covers them south of the Border for the single issue of Brexit. Even there, they must share the honours as second vote champions with the UK Greens. In Scotland, the latest poll puts them in fourth on just  per cent. And this despite winning a seat in recent European elections.If it’s too late to bring on a fresh face, the Lib Dems must find a fresh approach. Otherwise, it’s not just the big two parties that face political oblivion – ultimately, the big two-dependent Lib Dems will become political casualties as well. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"this scottish city has the worst congestion in the uk says study","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Motorists in Edinburgh face the worst traffic queues in the country, according to a new report revealing the city as the most congested in the UK.Drivers spend as much as  per cent longer on the city’s choked roads during the average rush hour journey compared to the equivalent outside peak road use times, figures released by sat nav manufacturer TomTom found.Edinburgh topped the UK list ahead of London, Bournemouth, Hull and Belfast, placing it in the top  cities for worldwide congestion.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter.

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant. Working in close collaboration with the chefs and kitchen teams, the apprentices will develop, prepare and serve Climavore dishes to support and develop alternative aquacultures that promote cleaner usage of the tidal zone.The programme will be launched with a celebratory meal on Saturday st June at the oyster table in Portree. Prepared in partnership with the pupils, diners will be treated to a lunch of scallop ceviche, oysters, seaweed soup and carrageen panna cotta, washed down with a Harris Gin and sea buckthorn cocktail.Events on Sunday nd June will include a walk to a rare native Skye oyster habitat, which will be followed by a screening of the recently-released film #Artishal# at the Aros Centre in Portree. Produced by Patagonia, #Artishal# is a film about people, rivers, and the fight for the future of wild fish and the environment that supports them. The film screening will be followed by a discussion led by environmentalist Corin Smith.Alon Schwabe of Cooking Sections explained why he believed this project was so vital. He said: #All across the Scottish isles, the United Kingdom and across the planet we are witnessing a tremendous loss of bioersity and extensive pollution of our air, land, and waterways. In the UK and all around the world, the environments we leave to future generations are in a fragile state.#Climavore questions how we eat as humans changes climate and develops programmes to provide tools to young residents of Skye to transform food practices, ecologies and environments to become better places for humans, plants and animals living along the tidal zone.#Atlas Arts producer Shona Cameron added: #Working with the students and teachers at Portree High School over the last year has been an exciting development for this project. The students have shown real enthusiasm to learn about the local ingredients and engage in conversations that question sustainability.#It has been brilliant to see restaurants across the islands continue to show enthusiasm towards the aims of Climavore and demonstrate a willingness to take on apprentices, working with them to bring Climavore dishes to their menus. It is our vision to expand the apprenticeships to more students and restaurants across the whole academic year, starting in September .#If you would like to attend these events or wish further information, you can visit atlasarts.org.uk, email shona@atlasarts.org.uk or phone  ."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/KEEP-TO-THE-LEFT-1-Copy.jpg","title":"tech giants urged to join keep left road","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineTech giants are being urged to provide an additional safety feature to stop foreign motorists from driving on the wrong side of the road.Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes has written to leading satellite navigation firms such as Apple and Google Maps to highlight the concern.Because some sat navs and smartphones give users a reminder of the speed limit, she hopes that a similar notice can be given so that tourists stay on the left-hand side.Ms. Forbes is supporting the #Keep Left# campaign, which was launched after Skye woman Sharon Anslow was injured in a collision with a tourist#s car last year.Ms Forbes said: #Nobody intentionally drives on the wrong side of the road, but clearly we#ve got to do more to remind visitors to drive on the left.#Having contacted all the car hire companies to raise awareness of this issue, I#ve started looking at other points of contact with tourists.#I#m sure that many will be using a navigation device, whether a GPS, SatNav, Google or Apple maps.#Already, these devices usually remind drivers not to touch it whilst driving and to keep to the speed limit.#I have contacted the tech companies to askthey could develop them further to remind drivers to drive on the left.#This could be done either verbally whilst driving or a warning sign before the start of a journey.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

The Amateurs celebrated reaching the historic milestone by holding a gala sports dinner at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel in Ballynahinch“Sixty years is a long time for a Junior or indeed an Intermediate club to keep going, especially in the modern day when there are so many other attractions,” said Mr Martin.He revealed that the Irish FA was working on a strategy to reverse the nationwide decline in the adult game, and hoped that the Amateurs would themselves benefit from this plan in the near future.Over  members, friends and former players of Dromore Amateurs enjoyed a fantastic evening at the Millbrook Lodge Hotel, Ballynahinch on April  as the club celebrated in fine style its th anniversary.Formed at the beginning of the   season, the Amateurs have maintained football in the Co Down town for six decades.Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, presents a crystal vase to Amateurs chairman Russell WardAs well as the president of the Irish FA, special guests on the night included Terry Pateman, chairman of the Northern Amateur Football League, and Maurice Johnston, vice chairman of the Mid Ulster Football League.Dromore played in the Northern Amateur Football League from  to  and again from  to , before moving to the Mid Ulster Football League where they currently play in the Intermediate B Division.The compere and after-dinner speaker was BBC legend Jackie Fullerton, whose wit and charm throughout the evening brought much fun and laughter.The Ballymena man’s tales about sporting icons George Best, Joey Dunlop and Alex Higgins went down a storm with the audience.Mid Ulster Football League representatives Maurice Johnston, vice chairman, left, and Stephen Magill, honorary secretary, right, make a presentation to Russell Ward, chairman of Dromore AmateursMr Fullerton was the perfect gentleman with all he met, mingling with guests and accommodating every request for a photograph or a selfie with good grace.SpeechesThe Amateurs’ hard-working committee was delighted to secure the attendance of such a prestigious guest as the president of Irish FA.Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even further Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"However, the pleasure was reciprocated because, of course, Mr Martin is an Amateurs old boy himself.Top goalscorer and first team player of the year Matthew Reain, centre, withcoach Keith Halliday and manager Graeme DavisHe spent  years with the club as a player and club treasurer.“I receive many invitations over the course of a year but this is one which gives me so much pleasure in being able to attend,” Mr Martin told the audience. “It was Mountview Park in  when I joined the club.“I was a second team player. Robert Gracey, Sam Vint, Aubrey Davidson, Wyn Crothers, Brendan Maginess, Philip Roy, Bernie Mackin, John Toucher and, of course, so many others, were my teammates.“They were great times, great moments. We weren’t successful, however these guys were fine clubmen.“I was treasurer from  to . We developed the clubhouse and upgraded the pitch and surroundings. We put the club on a sound financial footing before I left in  – this was achieved from a less-than-zero position in .“Suffice to say, this is where I began as a football administrator and I have always been grateful to the club for that.”Commenting on the Amateurs’ exciting plans for a new pitch and clubrooms, Mr Martin said the future was looking bright for his old club. He brought the best wishes of the Irish FA and on their behalf presented a crystal bowl to Dromore chairman Russell Ward to mark the occasion.Indeed, Mr Ward was a busy man on the night.In addition to making two fine speeches himself, the Amateurs chairman was presented with a further two pieces of crystal from Mr Pateman and Mr Johnston. Both league officials made excellent speeches during which they brought the best wishes of their respective organisations and paid generous compliments to Dromore on reaching their th anniversary.AuctionA highlight of the evening was the auction of sporting memorabilia. Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect.

He started his football career with Dromore Amateurs before playing for Glenavon in the Irish league and later ing to his much-loved Dromara Village FC, as both player and assistant coach. Walter was held in high esteem at DVFC, where his name features on the roll of honour.Triplets Blake, Ryan and Megan were aged just four when their dad passed away, leaving his we Margaret and family heartbroken at the loss of a much loved husband and father. Since then the McVeigh family has raised funds for Leukaemia and Lymphoma NI and the Anthony Nolan trust,with a range of events.

It’s great the club are helping us to create a special day that will be remembered forever, with funds going to two worthy charities.”Walter visited Old Trafford many times and dreamt of taking his children to see United play, but it wasn’t to be.When the family began thinking about what they could do to honour him, on his th anniversary year, it felt right, they said, to invite Manchester United Legends to play at Dromara a select team of Walter’s old frends, teammates and his children. Walter’s son Blake added: “I know how much my dad would have loved to have been involved in a game like this, playing alongside his idols, as well as Ryan and I.”The family’s thanks go to DVFC for the use of its ground on match day and for continued support over the years also to local councils for help on launch day and for support provided.

It was really satisfying, there were no TVs, no gaming machines, managing there was all about conversation.”Gerry spoke of how the initial spark of the Jawbox brand came about due to his “wee bit of entrepreneurial spirit” – the ‘spirit’ being his drink of choice.“In all the years I’ve worked in bars the only spirit I’ve ever liked was gin. I had the idea of producing my own gin, bringing out my own brand. If it didn’t work I was more than happy to stay on as a barman, I would’ve always regretted never giving it a go.”Gerry said the process took over two and a half years from the concept to getting the name registered.“I did come close to giving up but all the right people came together, the absolute best of the best, with Echlinville distiller Shane Branf, his head distiller Graham Miller and packaging and branding coming from Drinksology. Everything started to move dead fast.”The launch night of Jawbox took place in late February  – “a night of one of the worst storms, so I wasn’t hopeful people were going to turn up” – at the Linehall Library, with a little help from the then Lord Mayor Arder Carson.“I didn’t want to launch Jawbox in a bar, every other bar would’ve gone ‘Well, why didn’t you launch it in my bar ’ I wanted something ‘old Belfast’ and at the start Linenhall [Library] told me that didn’t really do launches as such. I loved the setting and told them I had the Lord Mayor on board – I just had to ask him,” he laughed.“I then went over to City Hall and said ‘Any chance of speaking to the Lord Mayor ’ The staff were brilliant and Arder came over and fair play as he likes a brandy.“The next day, when it was being rolled out, I think almost every bar in Belfast took it.”In the event, over  people turned up to support Gerry that night – “one of their own”Jawbox is now served in bars across Ireland, has its own mural in Kelly’s Cellars, is the go-to spirit at Belfast International Airport, is served across the water as well as its signature label displayed in over , retail outlets in England, Wales and Scotland.Recently awarded Supplier of the Year at the Institute of Hospitality Awards at Titanic Belfast, Gerry was one of five artisan suppliers chosen to showcase his product at a reception for Prince Charles and Camilla at the Grand Central on Wednesday.“The name comes from my granny, Maisie, Maisie Cunningham, who would always say to us ‘In my day we all stood round the jawbox and did our washing,’ as not everyone had the pleasure or the luxury of having their own shared washing area. Everything would have been washed in a big Belfast sink, clothes, dishes, the baby –everything was washed in it. People shared their stories, told their tales, it was their jaws going round the box. I always say to people to this very day, when they have parties, where do people go  The kitchen. Everybody stands around the sink.”It’s evident just how much pride and enthusiasm Gerry has for the product that has grown at a speed he never foresaw just three years ago.“The award for Supplier of the Year meant an amazing amount to me, it was my fth time being shortlisted, twice for Jawbox, always the bridesmaid, never the bride. It was fantastic.”The -year-old says the power to promote Jawbox via social media is “amazing”.“There are places Jawbox is appearing that I would never know. Philip Schofield posted a bottle to his Snapchat, everybody was ringing me saying ‘did you see it  Did you see it ’”Having grown up in C­onway Street and later Lenadoon, Gerry has his base just off Queen’s University Belfast. “Where will the next three years take Jawbox ” I ask him. He replies: “The States.”“You only get one chance in America. It’s a matter of making sure we have the right importer, distributor. Sean Muldoon and Jack McCarty from the Dead Rabbit are out there who are going to be so supportive. I used to work with Sean in the Northern Whig. “Just two weeks ago Jawbox was used as the reception drink for the Irish Film Festival in Australia, we launched in Sweden.”Inbetween “surprising” those who take part in weekly ‘Gin Jaunts’ every Saturday afternoon as part of the extremely popular Taste and Tour experience, Gerry hosts Jawbox gin evenings at ious hotels were he shares his passion with others keen to hear how Jawbox was born.“I was really surprised to see how many young people turn up to these events. I nearly dropped when someone asked me to sign a bottle recently.“What I set out to do from the start was build a legacy, make the product authentic, that’s why my signature is on the bottle. I knew from the start that the quality of this product had to be better than anything  out there.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PIPS-families.png","title":"pips families provide helping hand to each other","story":"NORTH Belfast suicide prevention charity PIPS has been to the forefront over the years in providing support to iniduals who are considering or who have at some point considered ending their own lives.PIPS also provide support to families and friends who have been touched by suicide, with their family group the driving force behind such support.PIPS Family Group Meeting takes place every Wednesday night from pm to pm in Tesco at Cityside.The group is currently made up of seven members, all women who have lost a family relative to suicide.Two such members are Patricia Perry, who lost her son Johnin , andAnne McKenna, wholost her son Broguein .Patricia explained how she involved in the group.“My son died  years ago. PIPS came to the house for the wake and I got talking to them,” she said.“They offered me the chance to come for some therapy sessions and to get involved in the family group. I went and thought at the time it was all too much. It just wasn’t for me.“A few years later I thought about it and went back. I met the other members and we have been best friends ever since.“The thing is we know exactly how each other feels. You can’t explain it to anyone  how it feels to lose a child.“There is one woman in the group who lost three sons and another who has lost two.”Anne joined the group six years ago when her son Brogue died.“For me, the group provides great friendship for me and I enjoy coming every week,” she explained.“When it is my son’s birthday or the anniversary of his death, sometimes I don’t feel like leaving the house but I would never miss a group meeting on a Wednesday night.“Really, without this group I don’t think I would be doing as well as I am today.“Every week, I look forward to a Wednesday night to come along and meet with people I now class as my friends.”As well as exchanging their own personal stories of heartbreak and loss, PIPS Family Group is much more than sharing their loss.Every year, members save up to fund a four-day holiday abroad with previous destinations including Amsterdam, Malta and Portugal. They also have regular days out, shopping trips and an annual Christmas dinner.“I think the social aspect of the group is very important,” added Patricia. It is not all miserable and we all enjoy our holidays and day trips to just get away from it all. We have all become really good friends.“We work closely with New Lodge Arts doing things like arts and crafts and doing social things with them really gives us all a bit of a lt.“Losing a loved one is dferent for each person. I understand the group might not be for everyone.“We all just sit and chat. We can talk openly about our loved ones we have lost and it helps us remember the good and happy times.”Due to renovation work at PIPS Antrim Road offices, the family group recently got good news of a room available in Tesco in Cityside, Yorkgate, where their weekly meetings will be held for the foreseeable future.Despite the success of the group, Patricia would like to see a similar group set up for men so that men can talk to each other about the subject.“The suicide rate in North Belfast is terrible. It is an epidemic,” she said.“We badly need a similar group like ourselves, but for men so that they can too talk to each other.“We have welcomed men before but some felt it just was not the setting for them.“I wish a man out there would do something. Men need to be talking.“As for our group, it is great to have this new room in Tesco. It is a good size and a lovely room.”PIPS Family Group are open to welcome new members.

In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back.

As we all know to get an agreement everybody has to agree, and there wasnt an agreement last February.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work. The shedders also sing, cook and enjoy copious amounts of tea, biscuits and craic.And when not busy making things, the men love to get out and about visiting other Menrsquos Sheds which is a great way to network and exchange ideas.They also take part in day trips and have been involved in a new community engagement programme at Hillsborough Castle. The local shedders have also been given a fantastic tour of the grounds at Castle Ward to see their very own bird boxes being installed.The Downpatrick Menrsquos Shed is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays between .am and pm and on Friday between .am and .pm.For more information about the work of the organisation and how to get involved, telephone   or visit the Facebook Page, @MensShedDownpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Former chairman reflects on year in office  ","story":"FORMER Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin has described his term at the helm of the organisation as ldquoabsolutely fantastic.Mr Murnin mdash who lost his Slieve Croob seat to SDLP colleague Hugh Gallagher at the recent council election mdash served the area for four years, with his term as chairman a particular highlight.Reflecting on his year in office, which took him across Europe, the United States and the Far East, Mr Murnin said he spent almost  nights abroad and that there were many high points over the past  months.Addressing the local authorityrsquos annual meeting last week, the outgoing chairman thanked his party colleagues, fellow councillors and staff for their support.But Mr Murnin said the joy of his year in office was tinged with sadness as a number of people across the district tragically lost their lives, including a council staff member.ldquoThere were many highlights along the way, continued the chairman whose time at the helm concluded with a major charity walk which raised over pound, for Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, Harmony Community Trust and Newry Gateway Club.ldquoIt was great to start off my year with the districtrsquos special olympians and to be with them again near the end of my term in office. They represented the district so well at Irish level and again at world level in Abu Dhabi, bringing home medals.Mr Murnin also referred to the success of the inaugural Be Active Cup involving soccer teams from opposite sides of the council area. He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me. We then had the Innovation Nation event, bringing many young people from our schools together to see the exciting advances in the business opportunities that are presented to them going forward.Mr Murnin said he was also involved in helping fundraise for brave Bessbrook girl Ellen Treanor and six-year Alfie Pentony from Newry who will both travel to the US for pioneering health treatment.Sadly for the former chairman, rain intervened last August and the annual Festival of Flight international air show in Newcastle was cancelled.On a serious note, he told those in the chamber that a great responsibility comes with being a councillor.ldquoAs you strive to make this district the number one place to do business and set up a home, itrsquos worth remembering that those across the council chamber are not necessarily the enemy mdash you all must work together for the betterment of our district, he said.ldquoDuring my recent visit to New York, I was able to see how investors view the world and it was interesting to see where they see opportunities and risks, in particular.ldquoOne of those was climate risk and the importance of it, with businesses looking at it from an investors point of view. As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees. This is something we should look to replicate where we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Foster sisters and Alex shine at schools’ event  ","story":"THE Newry Mourne and Down Primary Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships were held in Kilbroney Forest Park last Tuesday.Jodi Foster was first in the P girls and her sister Kari was second in the P girls.

His young  year-old jockey, Sean Armitage, was giving the horse a work-out gallop in preparation for the Sligo race meeting when he suddenly felt the horse jerk.Moments later they saw blood trickling down the neck of the horse and after finding a small hole they realised that a bullet had done the damage. The incident happened near the army camp.Mr Treacey, who lives at Ardglass Castle, reported the incident to police and investigations began immediately. However, they have not discovered who fired the bullet.ldquoThe future of the horse is very much in the balance, said an unhappy Mr Treacey. ldquoThe bullet is lodged close to the horsersquos spine and my vet has suggested a very tricky operation is needed to remove it.ldquoWorse still, it could easily have been my jockey who was hit. He was in the racing position on the horse and had the bullet been six inches higher it would have hit him in the head.A police spokesman confirmed the incident and said that it had been established that the horse had gunshot wounds, possibly from a . bullet.ldquoOur investigations are continuing and we hope to be in a position to establish whether it could have been a ricochet or a stray bullet from the firing range, or a deliberate shooting incident, he said.LEITRIM mdash Road racer Tom Herron, tragically killed at the North West meeting on Saturday, was buried beside Leitrim Presbyterian Church on Monday.

Out of the  people I asked, only one felt they were being represented at Stormont.ldquoI have decided to speak out and am working with others on my campaign. Rather than talk about doing something, I am going down this road because I believe that action is stronger than words.Mr Morgan says he is attempting to ascertainthere is consensus among the people of Northern Ireland for political change and politicians who want to work together for everyonersquos benefit.ldquoI am throwing my idea out there for people to stop what they are doing on June  between pm and .pm to show their frustration at what is currently happening, he explained. ldquoPolitical stagnation and climate change are crucial issues that we must do something about.ldquoI hope that people in every town, village and hamlet across this district and throughout Northern Ireland, including post-primary school students and those who attend further education colleges and universities, will take part.Mr Morgan said he wants residents and those who work in shops and offices to demonstrate that they want change.ldquoJune  is an opportunity for people to demand change, equal rights and equality.

I want people to select a venue in their own area and meet there in silence for just a short period to send out a clear message that they have had enough and are demanding change, he continued.ldquoI am particularly keen to see students taking part as they are the future. We need to listen to what they have to say, particularly with regard to the future of local politics and the planet. We have not had a government in this country for two years which is disgraceful. I believe that our MLAs have effectively disqualied themselves from public office.He argued Northern Ireland, which was once a world leader in many fields, particularly engineering, needed a system of government which was not run along ldquoorange and green lines.He continued: ldquoWe want our country to be a world leader again, this time in agreeing political solutions and addressing the issue of climate change. I believe that we need a system of government which is based on non-party politics.ldquoParty politics across the globe has failed and in all my  years I have never had a government that represented me or indeed one that I had respect for. This has to end. We need a government for everyone which comprises independent members bringing their own particular strengths to the table.ldquoThere is no point calling for change and standing back. We have to make this happen with human rights and equality for everyone, regardless of their religion, political view, sexual preferences or colour of their skin. We need government by the people for the people.He added: ldquoI hope people will grasp the opportunity they are being offered on June .

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved. We in Bishopscourt were worried about paying our staff and have been provided with some relief. We are also grateful to our parents for their continued support and loyalty.The Bishopscourt playgroup will be taking part in a sponsored bag pack at the Asda supermarket in Downpatrick this Saturday between am and pm.

If you havenrsquot been to Meelmore Lodge lately, then go check it out. A signicant amount of investment has been done there and therersquos great parking facilities and easy access to the Ulster Way under the shadow of Meelmore .Therersquos accommodation there, including pods and plenty of camping spaces - great for a night out. The race exited the campsite with the organisers issuing strict instructions for runners not to cross walls or fences, except through an open gate where a marshal would be there to direct them.Wet tops were the order of the day, for while it was mild and dry, but there were a few ominous grey clouds around and once up near to , feet the climate conditions can be much more challenging.By the way, one of the race directorsdecided it would be wise to recce the course earlier in the week.So on Monday evening meeting at the above-mentioned stunning Meelmore Lodge, he gathered with a few so-called running mates. They set off, quickly deciding to start the race on the green paddock below the lodge .The decision to start there had far-reaching consequences for just adjacent to the chosen start location, come Thursday at pm, a camping couple decided to cook dinner on a makesht stove - they must have been planning a quiet romantic evening with stunning views and just as they had sat down, Frank Morgan, the perennial starterwith his flags and tape followed soon after by hundreds of runners and spectators gathering beside them - no need for them to put on the TV, they had all the live entertainment they needed.Back to Monday evening and the lsquocourse recce crewrsquo followed the Trassey river, crossing it before the hard climb up Slievenaglough, then following the green shoot up to the first check point at its summit.Then it was the technical descent down and up to the summit of lesser-known Lukersquos Mountain and from there making their way home.Mountain leader and rescue stalwart, Ian McCracken fell not once, but twice going over on his ankle badly mdash thankfully, no need for the mountain rescue as the lsquoProphetrsquo was there to guide him home safely mdash poor Ian, after all the winter preparation there would be no Thursday evening race for him.As the runners milled around , Pete Grant, who was surprisingly wearing his club vest for a change, must have had a category win on his mind, as he moaned and groaned about the long, sharp start, delaying the time before he could get his shoes properly mucky.Later on, however, that would be the least of his worries as for some reason he decided to leave his car keys somewhere out on the open mountain at a grid reference that to the present time only God knows.As Frankrsquos whistle was blown at ::the  runners charged off up the track and onto the open mountain.The route, mostly on sheep paths, took them directly onto the craggy summit of Slievenaglough that is part of the Mourne Wall route - a mountain that meant something on Thursday evening rather than just being an anonymous part of the route from the Harersquos Gap to Commedagh.Positively, pretty much everyone successfully reached the cut-off point of  minutes for the first mile that included around  feet of climbing.Newcastle ACrsquos Seamy Lynch had established a comfortable lead early in the race, clear of his club mate Mark Stephens with Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson also comfortable in the womanrsquos race, ahead of Karen Wilton from Lisburn and Mourne runner Sarah Graham.It should have been plain sailing for everyone, but as often happens, the low cloud rolled in onto the ridge between Slievenaglough and Lukersquos and the summit of Lukersquos disappeared from view. We are still not sure that everyone made it there, but what is certain is that everyone made it back.Legal counsel Higgins lives le in the fast lane, balancing defending the indefensible in one court room or another with le on the farm and a Viking love nest in Tullybrannigan.If therersquos controversy in a sport not known for its controversy, Higgins perhaps will not be too far away - gamekeeper turned poacher  On the way home he chose his own line and clearly there had been some pillow talk, for she did too - slightly dferent, but both probably crossed the moral line, but probably not far enough to be eligible for a criminal conviction.His talk of bringing his finely honed orienteering skills to the table was not convincing the lsquoBroken Wing Commanderrsquo, but despite his protests supported strongly by the lsquoHenrsquo, the directors have no appetite for years in court ending in the European Court of Justice, no doubt, so the results stand.A fine run from Ballydrain junior Jared Martin to come home in third - a big star for the future  Many of the runners remarked this was the best HD course in years and it was great to freshen the series up with a new route - food for thought for the organisers for  Many thanks to all at Meelmore Lodge for the use of their facilities in this beautul location, the marshals, time keepers and people behind the scenes who keep the series running smoothly each week.Thanks also to the Avoca Hotel  Spa on their excellent food and beverages, by order of Jack OrsquoHare.Tomorrow night sees theto Millstone with full body cover required.

After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingN.I. child reported missing is found safe and wellSerious crash update: One person taken to hospital and road reopened to trafficOne of N.I.s busiest roads to shutdown within the next  minutes*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

This is better for the environment as LED lights produce less CO.ldquoIt is dficultnot impossible to find parts for the old Victorian lamp posts, so retention and refurbishment of the street lights is generally not an option.ldquoThe lantern design on the posts is also incompatible with a conversion to LED lighting and the switch forms part of the councilrsquos Street Lighting Energy Reduction Strategy.Ms Weightonrsquos pavilion exhibition, called lsquoAdre ndash Homersquo continues until May .The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I felt like he felt like it was a joke.ldquoBut I didnrsquot and I was really angry with it.The witness said it took five to  minutes for the girl to calm down after the event and described how the youngster was screaming and trying to get away from the accused, who was holding her.The woman also spoke of an incident around the same time of year when she said she saw Dunn moving to put his hand over the childrsquos mouth and nose.The court heard she told police in a statement: ldquoOut of nowhere, Tom saidkids find it hard to sleep you suffocate them by putting your hand over their mouth and nose for a number of seconds until they go drowsy.It added: ldquoI was shocked. It came from nowhere, I just thought it was an odd thing to say.Defence advocate Niall McCluskey put it to the witness that the incidents could not have been so serious since she had left her child in Dunnrsquos care following the tumble dryer incident.She said she disagreed and told the court: ldquoI wouldnrsquot accuse someone or make an accusation like thathellipldquoItrsquos for my child so she can get closure as well.ldquoI wouldnrsquot ly accuse someone of doing that, Irsquom not like that. I know I did make a mistake going back.Dunn, of Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, denies three charges of assaulting the child between December  and January .Dunn also denies assaulting a young boy on ious occasions between April  and January  by placing a hand over his mouth and pinching his nose, restricting his breathing.The case, before Sherf Alastair Brown, continues..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Child unable to get into tumble dryer on her own, trial told article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: “It has been another great show, and we’ve been very lucky with the weather. “A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of our th annual show, especially ABC Council, Translink and principal sponsor ABP. We are also indebted to the many iniduals who give so freely of their time to organise the show.”The cattle and sheep sections attracted a iety of continental, native and traditional breeds.Leading the cattle parade and securing the award for the supreme champion of champions was the Holstein cow Glasson Goldfish Form Erle VG from Philip and Simon Haffey’s -cow herd at Portadown. A second prize winner at Balmoral Show, she calved her third in March and is producing  litres of milk every day. Originating from the noted Erle family at Smiddiehill, her granddam was the ,gns Field of Dreams Formation Erle. The Haffey family have won seven successive Holstein championships at Lurgan Show. Interbreed cattle judge Cyril Millar, from Coleraine, described the overall show champion as a spectacular specimen of the breed. “It’s never an easy task judging beef cattle against dairy cattle, and the exhibitors deserve credit for putting on a tremendous show of quality animals. “Today’s overall winner is a flashy dairy cow with great power and scope. She has a big open frame, a well attached udder, and walks well on sound legs and feet.”Taking the reserve supreme award was the interbreed beef winner, an Aberdeen Angus heer from Richard and Fiona McKeown’s Herd at Templepatrick. This home-bred heer was born in April , and secured the reserve breed titles at Balmoral and Lurgan.  Cyril Millar added: “This heer is a peach of a beast, and a very close second. She oozes breed character from head to toe, and has great conformation and muscle.”Runner-up in the interbreed beef line-up was the two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Nikki exhibited by Nigel and Gail Matchett from Portadown.

I had the idea one Sunday night whilst watching TV. The initial plan was just a sponsored park run k, that led to ‘a why not make this a bit bigger and get St Peters involved’, a couple of phone calls with Ciaran McCavigan at St Peter’s and we had the bones of a plan.”Initial planning started straight away at the end of March with a lot of work between the clubs to coordinate with council PSNI etc.The Rugby Club and St Peter’s have been making great strides in reaching across the communities in Lurgan as David explained: “The friendship between the clubs started back a couple of years ago when Lurgan RFC contacted St Peter’s about getting a joint code session for the kids, this developed into our game of two halves and we’ve kept that up by having afixture in St Peter’s, this joint venture made lots of sense as it brought us together in a non-contested space i.e. Lurgan Park“It’s really important to stress that both the guys in St Peter’s and the Tigers see our joint projects as being something that will be long term, we aren’t interested in short term publicity or gains there is a firm commitment on both sides to deliver opportunities for all our kids and young people to interact and play sport together in a fun environment.David said the response has been Really positive so far with the PSNI, Council and Lord Mayor’s office all “really enthused”. Local businesses have got behind it too with Tesco Lurgan supplying fruit, People First snack boxes and River Rock water for participants: “People seem to really get on board with the cross community aspect and the whole concept, the support has been obvious from everyone who’s sponsored one of the kids.A total of around  are expected to take part in the run, start from the clubs at .pm. There will be relay runners leaving respective clubs and meeting in the centre of the town in the plaza at Market St , the last relay runners will exchange a football and a rugby ball in lieu of a baton before all the participants head down Windsor Avenue together to start the actual route in the park, It’s about k in the park for older kids and a shorter easier route for younger members.David said: “We hope everyone will join us afterwards at the fountain for refreshments, a bit of craic and hopefully a few rugby and footballs on the go.“We reckon this will be a very successful event that helps show what sport can do to bring communities together. It’s been great to work with Ciaran to get the run organised and we are already thinking of what we can do to build on this idea.”Translink display at Lurgan show ahead of railway line closure

Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.

The pampered pooch market is one which is booming – with around nine million dogs in the UK alone, and owners spending more than £ on food, snacks and clothing.
