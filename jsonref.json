I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027Wow.I understand why Harry dislikes the press after what happened to his mother, truly I do.Her death must have been incredibly hard for him to take as a 12-year-old boy.But let\u0027s be very clear - the press didn\u0027t kill Diana, a speeding drunk-driver killed Diana.And if she hadn\u0027t recklessly abandoned her usual royal protection officers and drivers, she\u0027d probably still be alive today.         Prince Harry, and Meghan pose with their newborn son Archie on May 8 this year. The Duke of Sussex accused the press of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027relentless propaganda\u0027Yes, she was the subject of huge press attention, but speaking from personal experience as a newspaper editor at the time, I can assure you she played the media game just as ruthlessly as we played it with her.She was the biggest star in the world, and would happily and regularly collude with the papers when it suited her – just as Meghan happily and regularly colludes with magazines like People and Vogue when it suits her.But with all due respect to Ms Markle, she\u0027s not in the same league as Diana in terms of fame.So for Harry to compare them in this way is both wrong and slightly distasteful. (And before the inevitable howls of \u0027you\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s like to lose a parent young\u0027 pour in, let me just point out that my father died when I was very young.)         Meghan was guest editor of September\u0027s Vogue, dedicating it to 15 \u0027fearless women,\u0027 including Jane Fonda, Jacinda Ardern and Greta ThunbergHe added that he has been \u0027witness to her private suffering for too long\u0027 and \u0027to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u0027Hmmm.It was only a few weeks ago that Meghan was telling people at a function that she never reads any press about herself. So how would she know what the press is saying, let alone suffer from it?As I\u0027ve often said, I have little time for Meghan after she ghosted me as a friend the moment she first met Harry. It signified a worrying social-climbing character trait that has seen her ditch many friends and almost all her family if she feels they may threaten her ferociously ambitious rise up the celebrity ladder.But what I think of her personally is irrelevant to the situation that actually sparked this battle with the media, and that is the breakdown of her relationship with her father.There\u0027s no doubt that Thomas Markle made a big mistake in stunting photos with the paparazzi before his daughter\u0027s wedding, as he has admitted himself.But did that really warrant him being banished forever in such a heartless manner?It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that Harry has never met his father-in-law, and that Meghan has now cut him out of her life.         Harry referenced his mother Princess Diana in his statement: \u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027 He is seen above with her and Prince William I\u0027ve interviewed Thomas several times and found him to be a very normal and nice, if naïve, guy who just had no idea how to handle the massive vicarious fame that instantly came his way after Meghan announced she was engaged to a British Prince.Rather then help him, they savagely punished him for a silly mistake, and his erratic behaviour ever since suggests a father deeply hurt and bemused by losing any contact with the daughter he brought up with such love and care.Thomas Markle gave Meghan\u0027s letter to the Mail on Sunday because he wanted to correct what he believed was misleading criticism of him in People magazine from Meghan\u0027s friends.Judge him all you like for it, but imagine how tough the past few years have been for him too? He has never even met his own grandchild.Thomas has been no angel in this family wrangle, but nor is he the devil.And he should be allowed the freedom of speech to defend himself.Rather than going to war with the press in this absurd manner, Harry should clamber down off his hysterical hothead high horse and repair the real running sore causing Meghan\u0027s distress – by making peace with her father. "},{"url":null,"title":"Kanye West drives away NYC churchgoers hijacks Sunday service","story":"Share this article \u0027Instead, West’s Sunday Service had the feel of slaves worshiping on a Southern plantation, praising select scripture that’s been provided in order to keep them in line,\u0027 she wrote. \u0027Greater Allen A.M.E.

From curators with aggressively short fringes and witty spectacles to patronising artists on rural residencies, he sees them all.Williams is no ingénue – he represented Wales at the Venice Biennale – but the satirical drawings he drip-fed through Instagram over the last year have a fanbase all their own. The Welshman has made it impossible to see art-world gatherings as much other than an assemblage of his painfully accurate caricatures. But now the serpent has eaten its own tail: Williams’s drawings are at Frieze, the art fair at Regent’s Park in London, shown by Southard Reid. Make a beeline for its booth and you’ll see the fair through different eyes.While Frieze is short on actual laughs (year on year, there is less bad plastic surgery, fewer wild costumes and a scarcity of ill-advised stilettos) the art itself tells an upbeat story. As though in riposte to dark times, colour dominates. Gagosian Gallery’s huge booth sets the tone with a suite of paintings titled Helios by Sterling Ruby, a California-based artist popular with the fashion crowd. This season, it seems, is all about yellow and orange: Ruby’s paintings are so bright that standing mid-booth feels less like greeting the California dawn than being stuck inside a spacecraft hurtling toward the sun. A migraine hazard it may be, but Helios certainly gets the fair off to a colourful start.Donna Huanca at Simon Lee makes a more calming offer. The artist usually works with performers whose naked bodies become part of what she paints. Here, she creates a mesmerising environment in which the visitors are the performers. Highly textured blue paintings, some freestanding and hung with braids, sit in a low-ceilinged white space above mounds of white sand amid a pervasive scent derived from palo santo, the fragrant wood burned during ayahuasca ceremonies.An elegant engagement with yet more dazzling colour comes at Lisson, which has one of this year’s most striking booths: a memorial to its artist Joyce Pensato, who died in June. Pensato’s large, expressionistic portraits of pop-cultural characters, all painted in black on plain backgrounds, are shown between intensely coloured blocky abstract paintings by her friend Stanley Whitney. The works are beautifully balanced: apparently the display had been planned before Pensato’s death but she became too unwell to complete work for it. The gallery instead borrowed paintings from private collections (none are for sale) and the result is one of the most powerful booths at Frieze.There are bursts of colour everywhere, in fact. Strong, graphic paintings with beaded embellishment by the US artist Jeffrey Gibson pop up at both Sikkema Jenkins and Kavi Gupta. Recalling geometric textiles or printing patterns, Gibson’s works carry thoughtful mottos: “You Better Let Somebody Love You” or “Make Your Own Kind of Music”.Lehmann Maupin painted every panel of its booth a different jewel-bright shade to show suites of photographs by Robin Rhode. The South African artist’s shtick is a combination of street art and staged performance – a play of illusions in which the human body interacts with painted material blossoming across a surface. Here, he’s worked with dancers whose changing positions apparently generate transforming geometric patterns panel by panel.It is, it seems, a year for painting, and for figurative painting in particular. Among the young discoveries are 25-year-old Joy Labinjo, showing at Tiwani Contemporary. Inspired by a photo album showing her British Nigerian family in moments of celebration, Labinjo has teased out particularities and common threads, from the style of pose to combinations of patterns and groupings. Her compositions are evocative if deliberately awkward, a tone reflected in her titles: Everything Will Be Alright and A Celebration of Sorts.There are gorgeous new paintings from established British favourites. Lubaina Himid, who won the Turner prize in 2017 and recently had a triumphant exhibition in New York, has Traditional Three Tier Wedding Cake at Hollybush Gardens: two black men share the canvas, each in his own universe, set apart by the reflected light picked up on their skin – one all indigo blues and lavenders, the other yellows and lime greens.Sadie Coles HQ’s booth is fronted by a complex sculptural screen by Helen Marten that feels endlessly fascinating and enigmatic. (Screens seem rather a phenomenon this year – just the thing for the collector who loves paintings but has run out of wall space?) The curated section, titled Woven, seems less coherent than in previous years. There is very little linking these solo displays by non Euro-American artists working with textiles and fibre, beyond that initial premise, either technically or thematically.The late Pacita Abad’s bright paintings pay homage to erse immigrant communities in the US, capturing the energy of billboards, painted signs and busy streets. Her optimism is broadcast in the radiating LA Liberty (1992) a Latinx Lady Liberty in a patchworked and embellished robe, her torch beaming a multitude of colours. What thread connects this to Angela Su’s disquieting anatomical pictures embroidered in human hair (beyond the fact that both artists wielded a needle) is hard to discern.Once unfashionable, textile art has a big presence at the fair. As with the bright colours and tendency toward figurative painting, there is a suggestion here that we currently need comfort and reassurance. Certainly very little hi-tech new media art is being shown. Jack Shainman Gallery has ravelling wall hangings by rising Texan star Diedrick Brackens, recipient of recent awards from the Studio Museum in Harlem and at Frieze New York. PPOW have a great tapestry by Erin M Riley, whose painstaking handwoven works engage with the instant gratification of camera phone imagery: selfies, sexts, handbag spills, all the apparently ad hoc documentation of contemporary life. Reflections shows the artist’s lavishly tattooed body reflected in the mirror, like a butt-centric update of Velázquez’s 17th-century masterpiece Rokeby Venus.Continuing the #MeToo mood of last year, there are fewer arty photos of beautiful naked young women, and far more works in which female artists depict sex and the body on their own terms. Star prize for erotic idiosyncrasy goes to Urara Tsuchiya, whose cute ceramic dioramas of interspecies orgies (pandas are among the favoured participants) are a London art world favourite. Given free rein at Union Pacific’s booth, Tsuchiya has created a hotel room mid-dirty weekend, with ceramic bra-and-thong sets strewn all about, a minibar hanging open, complete with bottles of ceramic booze, and lampstands and bowls full of naughty couplings.Cute ceramic panda sex? Sometimes the art world is so deliciously offbeat that even Bedwyr Williams couldn’t make it up.• Frieze London is in Regent’s Park, London, 3-6 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e2da663996636c053bb9322b88951ff5a5eb1c/0_178_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9652d07b51fa916bc58e7c93b78a4e30","title":"make it a double cabaret fledermaus bar recreated for barbican show","story":"Copy of short-lived Vienna venue is star of exhibition on artistic role of cafes and clubsFor fun-loving aesthetes in early 20th-century Vienna it was the place to be, a venue for expressionist dance, absurdist puppetry and experimental theatre, perhaps enjoyed with a “cabaret smash” from the cocktail menu.More than a century later there are no drinks on sale but the wildly colourful bar of the short-lived Cabaret Fledermaus has been recreated for an exhibition exploring the artistic role of cafes, cabarets and clubs around the world.The show at the Barbican art gallery in London shines light on the jazz clubs of Harlem, the Mbari clubs of Ibadan, Nigeria, and incubators of radical thinking such as the Cave of the Golden Calf in London and the Café de Nadie in Mexico City.More than 300 works are on display, the showstopper being the remarkable recreation of the Fledermaus bar by teachers, students and archivists at the University of Applied Arts in Vienna.“It is incredible, they worked tirelessly,” said the show’s curator, Florence Ostende. “They just had a black and white photograph and a colour postcard and they had to zoom in on every single detail to reconstruct the design.”The original bar and its recreation are works of art in their own right. The bar was designed by Josef Hoffmann for the Wiener Werkstätte, a cooperative artistic workshop, and the recreation features about 7,000 ceramic tiles of different colours and motifs.“When we started the discussion everyone thought we were crazy,” said Ostende. “You want to recreate one of the most iconic pieces of the Wiener Werkstätte? Nobody has done that before, it’s impossible. You don’t have enough archive, enough evidence. It was a real challenge.”The Cabaret Fledermaus, with its Gesamtkunstwerk (total work of art) design, opened in 1907 but it endlessly struggled to make money and was forced to close in 1913.Ostende said the show was about celebrating the importance of places such as Cabaret Fledermaus that had often ended up being footnotes in art history.Spanning from the 1880s to the 1960s, 12 venues around the world are featured, offering an alternative history of modern art, according to the curators. They range from Le Chat Noir in Paris, with its theatrical shadow plays, to Rasht 29, a meeting place of avant-garde painters and poets in Tehran, which opened in 1966.Other interior recreations in the show include a room from Theo van Doesburg’s L’Aubette in Strasbourg, a huge entertainment complex labelled the “Sistine Chapel of abstract art”, which opened in 1928.Every Thursday evening during the exhibition’s run, the Aubette space will become a music venue co-curated by the jazz trumpet player Mark Kavuma."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67397832bfbff5a7912b9e357dbbcfd9c54cd670/0_89_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73debd412649434720d52037bdd93277","title":"prize winning photos of peace in pictures","story":"From climate activists to orangutan babies, these images capture peace efforts around the worldThese international awards for the best images of peace celebrate professional photographers who visualise what inspires hope.

Collectors had travelled from as far away as Australia and Los Angeles to try to get their hands on Aspden’s latest limited edition, the Blackburn Nightsafe, a rubber-soled love letter to his home town. Aspden was excited that Adidas had agreed to launch the £100 shoe in Blackburn instead of London or New York on Friday. All proceeds from the 200 pairs made will go to a local homelessness charity, Nightsafe.“I’m absolutely over the moon about it. I can’t tell you how happy it makes me,” he said, his Lancastrian accent intact despite years spent working in London. “This is one of the top 10 poorest towns in Europe and I feel strongly that places like Blackburn, which have been hit badly by austerity, can be regenerated with the help of culture.”Getting the shoe into production involved protracted negotiations with Adidas’s lawyers, who initially vetoed the idea after bruising encounters with litigious cities the world over. When Aspden told Blackburn council about the concerns, the leader put his head in his hands. “He said: ‘You’re joking? This would be so good for the town.’ And they made it clear they would bend over backwards to make it happen,” Aspden said.Once he got the green light from his beloved Blackburn Rovers, who Adidas’s legal eagles had feared could also make a trademark claim, Aspden set about designing the shoe. He decided against emulating Rovers’ blue and white kit and zoomed in instead on the red and green of the Lancastrian rose.Aspden’s show is likely to be one of the most popular exhibits at the inaugural British Textile Biennial, which runs throughout autumn in locations across east Lancashire. Set in and around the infrastructure of the cotton industry, the festival celebrates the past and present of UK-made textiles through art, design and performance.Jamie Holman’s commission, Transform and Escape the Dogs, tells the story of how Blackburn’s mills were taken over for raves in the 1980s, culminating in the Live the Dream party in the village of Tockholes. Holman spent 18 months winning the trust of old Blackburn ravers, who were protective of their legacy. The resulting show is a co-production with these acid house survivors, who allowed him to use video footage of the parties as well as photos, which Holman had made into a stained glass window and silk trade union-style banners.Fourteen miles away in Pendle, the biennial takes over Brierfield Mill before the mill is turned into luxury apartments. Banner Culture is a mass staging of banners waved at protests in the UK over the last 100 years.

It is the most complete pterosaur specimen ever found in Australia including parts of the skull and five vertebrae and wing elements.“It would have been a sight to see,” said Adele Pentland from Swinburne University, the lead author of a study published in the journal Scientific Reports. “It has a wing of about four metres, which is pretty big compared to our modern-day birds.“Even though we didn’t find the entire skull, we found most of the skull and we also found 40 teeth and two fragments at the site. To see it walking around on the ground it would have walked on four legs and looked really different to any kind of animal we have today.“It’s kind of scary when you think their heads are disproportionately large, it would have had a skull maybe 60cm.”Pentland said elements of the find had surprised researchers. She said that based on unique crests on its upper and lower jaw, researchers identified it as genetically close to a previous find in England.“We are seeing that pattern because they could disperse across the ocean pretty easily.”The fossil’s small front teeth and other “unique dental characteristics” distinguish it as a new and distinct species. It is one of the latest-surviving members of the Anhanguera group.The decision to name the species after Lenton honours him as an advocate for outback Queensland and its tourism opportunities, including Winton’s Age of Dinosaurs museum, renewable energy and cultural programs in the bush."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493da0a511a8ed4d32299b20c6a2f1fa3ddfe02f/0_258_3954_2373/master/3954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ec29770e9be66a353c20bbd48ef4560","title":"pissoirs and public votes how paris embraced the participatory budget","story":"Arnaud Carnet was crossing Paris on his bicycle one day when something strange caught his eye: a dilapidated old urinal stationed at the foot of the high walls of the last operational prison in the city.This graffitied, ripe-smelling structure was far from a standard street pissoir. Carnet discovered that it was in fact the last remaining 19th-century vespasienne urinal in the city. He decided he needed to save it.“It no longer conforms to the comfort standards of today,” he says of the urinal (an understatement). “But it’s a piece of heritage and it’s in a terrible state in the middle of the boulevard – it’s not possible to just leave it like that.”The urinal is “part of the great Parisian history of public sanitation,” he says, though he admits he’s never used it himself. “The participatory budget is an opportunity to give it a second youth.”Carnet’s project was one of 430 that went to public vote between 6 September and 22 September this year. Sadly for him, the vespasienne was not one of the 11 major projects and 183 smaller propositions that earned enough votes to become reality. Instead, Parisians chose projects that ranged from better recycling facilities to upgraded cycling infrastructure to programmes to help women who are experiencing homelessness.More than 140,000 people voted in the scheme, the sixth (and possibly last) time residents have been able to choose how the administration of mayor Anne Hidalgo spends a significant portion of its money.As usual, while the quixotic propositions tend to garner attention during the voting stage, it is the serious improvements to the city that tend to get funded, such as the €1.5m plan to upgrade cleaning facilities that won more than 37,000 votes last year, or the decision to send funds to a temporary migrant camp built on the outskirts of the city at the height of refugee arrivals to Europe.Paris’s deputy mayor for local democracy, Pauline Véron, says the vast majority of projects “aren’t bizarre or complicated – they’re serious. They can be original, a bit new or innovative, but they’re not harebrained.”The scheme was launched when Hidalgo came to power in 2014. At €45 per inhabitant, Véron says Paris runs the largest per capita participatory budget in the world. Overall, more than 1,800 inidual city improvements have been realised thanks to the public vote, Véron says.Thousands of proposals are submitted each year and must pass a feasibility study before qualifying for the vote. A plan to bulldoze Sacré-Coeur on the basis that it was an insult to the legacy of the 1871 Paris Commune was famously disqualified at this stage in 2017. (The city demurred not because the project would involve the permanent destruction of one of the most famous buildings in the world, but because the church belonged to the Archdiocese of Paris, and was hence outside its jurisdiction.)The programme was inspired by the city of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil, which successfully introduced a participatory budget in 1989 to tackle its rampant inequality. It is with the redistributive spirit of Porto Alegre in mind that Paris specifically allocates €30m of its participatory budget to working-class areas, Véron says.Despite this, the Paris incarnation lacks the radical spirit of the Brazilian scheme, says Gilles Pradeau, who is writing his PhD on participatory budgets at the University of Westminster. He notes that while a large part of the Porto Alegre budget was decided by residents, “what is critical in Paris about the making of the city is not done through participatory budgeting”.Still, the Paris scheme and one launched in Lisbon in 2008 have helped kick off a wave of imitators across Europe – similar projects are under way in Milan, Glasgow and Madrid. In France, the number of participatory budgets has doubled each year since 2014.With city elections set for March next year, it is not certain that Paris’s participatory budget will survive if Hidalgo, who has not yet announced her candidacy but who is widely expected to run, does not win re-election.Whatever happens in 2020, Véron says the budget will be an important part of Hidalgo’s legacy.And if the legacy of the last vespasienne in Paris still hangs in the balance, public urination did get a boost this year: a €240,000 proposal to install designer urinals along the Canal Saint Martin will now go ahead, thanks to the votes of more than 2,000 impatient Parisians.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season.

Temperatures are rising. The consequences for oceans, forests, weather patterns, bioersity, food production, water, jobs and, ultimately, lives, are already dire – and set to get much worse.The science is undeniable. But in many places, people don’t need a chart or graph to understand the climate crisis. They can simply look out the window.Climate chaos is playing out in real time from California to the Caribbean, and from Africa to the Arctic and beyond. Those who contributed least to the problem are suffering the most.I have seen it with my own eyes from cyclone-battered Mozambique to the hurricane-devastated Bahamas to the rising seas of the South Pacific.I called on the climate action summit to serve as a springboard to set us on the right path ahead of crucial 2020 deadlines established by the Paris agreement on climate change. And many leaders – from many countries and sectors – stepped up.A broad coalition – not just governments and youth, but businesses, cities, investors and civil society – came together to move in the direction our world so desperately needs to avert climate catastrophe.More than 70 countries committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050, even if major emitters have not yet done so. More than 100 cities did the same, including several of the world’s largest.At least 70 countries announced their intention to boost their national plans under the Paris agreement by 2020.Countries from Pakistan to Guatemala, Colombia to Nigeria, New Zealand to Barbados vowed to plant more than 11bn trees.More than 100 leaders in the private sector committed to accelerating their move into the green economy.A group of the world’s largest asset-owners – responsible for directing more than $2tn – pledged to move to carbon-neutral investment portfolios by 2050.This is in addition to a recent call by asset managers representing nearly half the world’s invested capital – some $34tn – for global leaders to put a meaningful price on carbon and phase out fossil fuel subsidies and thermal coal power worldwide.The International Development Finance Club pledged to mobilize $1tn in clean energy funding by 2025 in 20 least developed countries.One-third of the global banking sector signed up to align their businesses with the Paris agreement objectives and sustainable development goals.The summit also showcased ways in which cities and global industries like shipping can achieve major reductions in emissions. Initiatives to protect forests and safeguard water supplies were also highlighted.These steps are all important – but they are not sufficient.From the beginning, the summit was designed to jolt the world and accelerate action on a wider scale. It also served as a global stage for hard truths and to shine a light on those who are leading and those who are not. Deniers or major emitters have nowhere to hide.I will continue to encourage them to do much more at home and drive green economic solutions around the world.Our planet needs action on a truly planetary scale. That cannot be achieved overnight, and it cannot happen without the full engagement of those contributing most to the crisis.Too many countries still seem to be addicted to coal – even though cheaper, greener options are available already. We need much more progress on carbon pricing, ensuring no new coal plants by 2020, and ending trillions of dollars in giveaways of hard-earned taxpayers’ money to a dying fossil fuel industry to boost hurricanes, spread tropical diseases and heighten conflict.At the same time, developed countries must fulfill their commitment to provide $100bn a year from public and private sources by 2020 for mitigation and adaptation in developing countries.And I will make sure that the commitments that countries, the private sector and local authorities have made are accounted for – starting in December at the UN climate conference in Santiago, Chile. The UN is united in support of realizing these initiatives.Climate change is the defining issue of our time.Science tells us that on our current path, we face at least 3C of global heating by the end of the century. I will not be there, but my granddaughters will.I refuse to be an accomplice in the destruction of their one and only home.Young people, the UN – and a growing number of leaders from business, finance, government, and civil society – in short, many of us – are mobilizing and acting.But we need many others to take climate action if we are to succeed.We have a long way to go.

Women and men’s entitlement to a state pension was equalised by law back in 1995, so women retire at 65 now, at 66 next year – just the same as men. Sounds fair? Not to women born in the 1950s whose lives were hard work and slim savings, with no chance to build up pensions: they expected to retire at 60 and draw their state pension.Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) took their case to court for compensation and today they lost. These implacable campaigners for the pension rights of nearly 4 million women born in the 1950s turn up at every political event and tail each Department for Work and Pensions secretary relentlessly to protest about pension changes that left many in penury. Politicians groan inwardly when they see them coming, but these women never give up.Two of them, with the help of crowdfunding, sought a judicial review but today were turned down. They don’t oppose an equal pension age: their complaint is the speed with which women’s pension age has been raised, to 65 last year, to 66 next year, giving many no chance to build up a pension. The law was changed in 1995 and was intended to be phased in between 2010 and 2020 – but in 2011, the coalition government speeded up the change, implementing it in 2018. Many women were only warned by letter 16 years after the initial legislation was passed.This group are losing four to six years’ worth of state pension – life-changing inidual sums of some £47,000, while the treasury saved £30bn.The government’s case was bluntly put by Sir James Eadie QC: “Parliament has no substantive, freestanding obligation of fairness,” he told the court. There you have it, no duty to fairness and the court agreed, though claimed to be “saddened by the stories”. As we know, courts regard parliament as sovereign and parliament had passed it into law. Nor did it matter that the government had failed to warn the women: “There is precisely no obligation on parliament to notify those affected by its judgments,” Eadie said, and the court agreed.Here’s what stands out: governments have been slow to pass laws and slower still to enforce equality for women in every other field. When the equal pay and sex discrimination acts were passed by Barbara Castle in the 1970s, we who had campaigned thought it was all done and dusted, job done. Yet the pay gap yawns wide, while women’s promotion to higher jobs lags behind and fair treatment in essential services that give women an equal chance are a matter of political whim – from childcare, which is the most expensive in Europe, to refuges for victims of domestic violence. The one and only equality for women imposed with a rod of iron was the equalisation of pension ages, because it saved the Treasury a fortune.Waspi’s case was never against equalising the pension age – indeed, more women are in work and for longer. Since the abolition of the compulsory retirement age, the number of people continuing to work past the age of 65 has risen to 1.2 million. But introducing this “equality” at draconian speed was in effect a retrospective act. These older, poorer women’s lives were very different from younger women now. Many left school at 14 and 15 to work in hard manual jobs that took a toll on their health. Few had further education opportunities, and more of them are unskilled. They were paid less than men, and still are. In researching a book on work, I found trade union agreements in the car industry that demanded women be paid less, for fear they would take men’s jobs, hence the famous Dagenham women machinists’ strike. Part-timers, almost all women, were excluded from company pension schemes until 1989. Women back then had total responsibility as carers: there was no subsidised childcare nor nurseries until the BlairBrown government.Had they been clearly told, some could have planned working lives to last longer, though many couldn’t. Discrimination against older women applying for work is even worse than it is for older men. Michael Mansfield, representing Waspi, gave the court government documents proving ministers knew there was “widespread ignorance” among many women that they were about to lose their pensions. Informing people about pensions is notoriously difficult, hence the success of the recent automatic enrolment scheme requiring people to opt out – it relies on most people staying clueless.Those on high who make sweeping decisions about the lives of others screen out these brutal facts, as if they are beyond their comprehension. A large slice of the population they govern has nothing – no safeguards, no protection from even the smallest buffets in their lives. Poverty and living on the verge of poverty is widespread, and means a life of constant anxiety. Waspi describes how many of their number – unable to work until 66, and unable to draw a pension – are reduced to food banks to survive.With his usual empty bravado, when asked on the leadership hustings if he would help the stranded Waspi women, Boris Johnson promised to “commit to doing everything I possibly can to sorting out” the issue if he became prime minister. Now Johnson is in No 10, how many of those hasty promises of everything to everyone will he fulfil?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4753e369dba0e9fc7220ee912c6e6ef6885d7765/0_125_1870_1122/master/1870.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=368a59b12336bd585e03a18d424e103a","title":"the guardian view on the backstop proposals britains broken promise","story":"Boris Johnson has reached for the word compromise many times in the last two days as he has promoted his new Brexit proposals. There were three mentions of compromise in his party conference speech in Manchester on Wednesday, a further four in his letter to the European commission, two in the statement he delivered to MPs at Westminster on Thursday and several others in the exchanges that followed.These usages, although tendentious, are not wholly specious. Mr Johnson’s proposals are an attempt to bridge the gap between the EU-UK withdrawal agreement signed by Theresa May last year and the root-and-branch rejection of that agreement by the Conservative party’s most dogmatic pro-Brexit faction. Setting aside the fact that Mr Johnson himself voted for that agreement in March, the prime minister has moved the dial a few notches from his previous determination to get rid of the Northern Ireland backstop in its entirety.However, the new proposals are not a compromise with the European Union, which is the body with which he ought to be seeking a deal. They are a compromise with the Democratic Unionist party. Mr Johnson has courted the DUP more assiduously than even Mrs May did. He has spoken at their conferences, invited them into Downing Street and generally gone the extra mile to find ways of appeasing their demands that Northern Ireland should not be treated differently from the rest of the UK. The compromise Mr Johnson has now made with the DUP allows him to say that there can be some all-Ireland regulations for a limited period – which would mean Britain and Northern Ireland leaving on different terms – while the DUP has secured an effective veto over their further continuation, thus ensuring that Northern Ireland will be fully part of the UK customs territory in the longer term. But they are talking to themselves, not to the wider polities of Ireland, Britain or Europe.Mr Johnson ignores three huge issues. The first is that the DUP does not speak for Northern Ireland, whose people voted to remain in the EU in 2016 and where opinion polls regularly show support for the backstop and for separate treatment for Northern Ireland to preserve the all-Ireland economy. By allowing the DUP to act as if it is the government of Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson ignores the majority that oppose the DUP’s pro-Brexit stance and mounting evidence that the DUP is now losing the hegemony that it used to enjoy. Giving a decisive role to Northern Ireland institutions that are suspended for intractable reasons solves nothing (and triggers the demand from Scotland that their devolved institutions should get a veto too). It suggests Mr Johnson might not be able to make his deal stick, even if the EU agreed to it.The second problem is that Mr Johnson’s plans renege on the principles, and legally rooted treaty guarantees, of north-south cooperation that have been the bedrock of the increasingly precarious Northern Ireland peace process. Preserving the BelfastGood Friday agreement was at the core of Mrs May’s approach. It is part of the EU (Withdrawal) Act itself that the UK will not create any form of “physical infrastructure” for border arrangements after Brexit. The reason why there is a backstop at all is because the May government took these promises seriously. Like so many English Tories in the past and today, Mr Johnson simply does not share that sense of responsibility. His plans betray Britain’s solemn promise and ignore the consequences for Ireland.The final problem is that the vagueness of Mr Johnson’s plans leaves a hole in the EU single market without proposing a workable solution. Controls of any kind are inconsistent with the principle of frictionless trade, while loose controls threaten rules and protections for consumers. It is typical of Mr Johnson and the hardliners that they have failed to engage with these realities at all.Yet the realities are immutable. Britain has profound legal and political obligations to the people of Ireland. Britain has deep moral obligations too. None of these are upheld in the government’s new proposals or by the untrustworthy way Britain behaves on the Irish and European stage. Mr Johnson calls it compromise. It should be called perfidy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b26e13a2454a8fa843af62dc56651feac55695f1/0_55_1616_970/master/1616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17c95ca97315b86ea2a2ac1079dc8152","title":"theresa may deal brexit","story":"So what now? Boris Johnson’s tactic of leaving Brexit to the last minute and then serving up a dog’s breakfast seems unlikely to work. Both Dublin and Brussels have effectively rubbished it. The offer to the EU is absurd. In place of Brexit’s promised “no border on the island of Ireland”, he offers two borders: a customs one on land and a regulatory one in the Irish sea. In place of “frictionless trade”, he offers a blizzard of bureaucracy and a gift to smuggling. In place of “take back control”, he offers a non-existent Northern Irish assembly a veto over British trade policy. As the prime minister’s first hesitant step into personal diplomacy, it is dire.But let’s stick to essentials. Johnson has rightly conceded that Northern Ireland should remain in an all-Ireland single regulatory zone, to honour the Good Friday agreement with the south. That is a relief. Yet he remains adamantly opposed to a customs union embracing the UK and the EU. This contradiction he submerges in a morass of costly technologies and checkpoints. Customs posts become “designated locations”. It is possible some type of “soft” border can be devised, but not by halfway through October. The nonsense of no customs union with no border has come home to roost.The only sensible way forward must now be to separate Brexit on 31 October from the resolution of these fiendish trading arrangements. The UK should formally leave the EU on time, and draw Brexit’s poison from the British body politic. This means parking the fate of the ongoing customs union in the transition period, as under Theresa May’s deal. But that involves agreeing a framework for its eventual resolution. Here the ideal for everyone should be stop rabbiting on about borders, and for the EU to take a gamble on easing the backstop. Of course the Northern Ireland government should not have a veto, but the British parliament should. The backstop should go on ice.That way the UK could leave the EU on 31 October and the 2016 referendum would be honoured. Over the British Isles would arise a deafening sigh of relief. Hard Brexiters could gird themselves for trade arguments to come, over border posts and regulatory alignments. Soft Brexiters could pray that a new British government might see sense, and opt to remain in the customs union and single market. Everyone could take a breather.But such a deal, if the EU agreed it, would first have to pass through the valley of the shadow of the present Commons. Johnson needs 320 votes and he does not have them. His reckless contempt for the House of Commons last week made it near impossible for Jeremy Corbyn to collaborate. But both men owe it to the country to attempt to steer this crisis to resolution. Further chaos over the Benn Act aimed at preventing crashing out would be a nightmare. Any Brexit deal returned to the EU27 in two weeks’ time should go with a thumping majority.Johnson’s negotiators now need to fudge everything except “leave on 31 October”. Corbyn in return would relinquish “leave on customs union terms”. Of these, the second is negotiable – at least over time. Johnson may not back down on his baffling hostility to the customs union, but he could agree to kicking the border issue into the transition period. Labour could honourably support a deal that left that option open, with its resolution “repatriated” to parliament.Johnson’s Tory fundamentalists, wrapped as they are in the casuistry of no deal, may be appalled by him talking to Corbyn. He should weaponise his reputation as a turncoat and opportunist. Yes, the Tory European Research Group might turn on him. He should strip them of the whip. As for the Northern Irish DUP, their attitude is less certain. They have had a nasty shock, with opinion in the Ulster province emphatically against hard Brexit. For them Johnson’s virtual border is simply a savage cost.As for Corbyn, he might lose the backing of the “rebel alliance” and of opposition referendum supporters. But he would no longer have round his neck the electoral albatross of opposing the will of the people. He would be rid of the Brexit incubus.Leaving the EU was never about trade. If anything more than a howl of anti-liberal protest, it was about immigration. A desire to restore sovereignty to Britain’s political institutions was perfectly valid, and leaving the EU would contribute towards that. Brexit is indeed Brexit, but that does not make it about leaving customs unions and single markets.When Thatcher negotiated the Single European Act in 1986, she rightly praised it is as a boon to free markets. Her subsequent reservations about a power-hungry EU might be seen as justifying Brexit, but not justifying a dismantled open market, as a hard Brexit proposes.There are many skeletons rattling in this cupboard. Some of those closest to Johnson seem exhilarated at the prospect of breaking the Benn Act, and moving Britain towards anarchy. They are dangerous. Some round Corbyn have a similar revolutionary purpose: that anything that damages the government must be good. This is the legacy of the new politics, to bring disruption to the heart of the constitution.Johnson and Corbyn may not be stars in the firmament of British political history, but on them has fallen the burden of getting the country out of this mess. Johnson is a prime minister on a hook of his own making. The EU and Corbyn would do everyone a service by helping him off it. They should amend and approve the May deal. It should be yes to Brexit, but hard or soft Brexit – that’s for another day. The first move should come from Corbyn. He opposed no-deal Brexit. He should show us a yes-deal one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345ccae4cfd7c6b8ffde1e378817325efa9dda44/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=2500\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84a4a5ba7211846c713d736d1e2a8836 5000w","title":"galleries brunches bars and boutiques a locals guide to torontos coolest neighbourhoods","story":"From Queen Street West to Leslieville and Riverdale in the east end, Toronto’s coolest neighbourhoods are home to some of North America’s most happening restaurants, watering holes and cultural hotspotsToronto is booming – pulsing with energy, from its homegrown art scene and its erse culinary offerings to its status as one of North America’s style capitals. Rivalling New York City and LA, Toronto’s become a new premier destination for millennials curious to discover its thriving arts, culture, fashion and dining scenes.After taking in some of the top-tier downtown attractions, such as the CN Tower, head over to nearby Kensington Market. Spanning only a few blocks, the streets lined with outdoor fruit markets, musicians and local craft boutiques are emblematic of Toronto’s erse spirit.From Mexican to Japanese food, the market is a culinary beast. It’s home to Toronto’s best-rated taco shop, Seven Lives, where you can snatch a spot in line and grab a combo of three fish, octopus or shrimp tacos for less than £10. Wash it down at El Rey, a mezcal bar with an Americana western vibe, where a shot and brew go for less than £8. Finally, for a spot of fine dining, look no further than acclaimed chef Jen Agg’s Grey Gardens, where you can enjoy wine and oysters in an exquisite French-bistro setting.Kensington Market is also a treasure trove of vintage finds. So whether you’re looking for a bossy fur coat or a 90s Nike tracksuit, get thrifting! Mixed into the vintage crawl are local designer clothing and jewellery stores that offer a personalised touch at a reasonable price. One of these most notable mainstays is Sole Survivor – an all-female shoe and leather repairs shop, owned by Lorena Agolli. The caring neighbourhood spirit of the city comes alive in the shop, with the craft perfected in patience and care.‘I would say to come and visit with an open mind and to avoid just visiting the standard tourist attractions. Instead, try and get lost in the more erse and culturally immersive areas in the city, like Kensington Market.’ Lorena Agolli, Sole Survivor ownerMore or less everyone in Toronto can agree that Riverdale and the adjacent neighbourhood of Leslieville are having a moment. While most of this guide features hotspots in the west end, the sweeping views of the skyline and flourishing culinary scene puts this east end spot on the map.Toronto’s appetite for brunch is huge – and its menus reflect the city’s status as one of the most erse in the world, fusing cultures, ingredients and techniques from across the globe. Leslieville knows its way around a brunch better than pretty much anywhere else in Toronto. Lady Marmalade, a long-time local gem for all-day breakfast, has featured in the top 10 eggs benedict in the city since it opened in 2005. Mixing traditional and Mexican-inspired dishes, the bright, airy space combines local hospitality with a touch of elegance.For lunch, the Real Jerk, which was the filming location for Drake and Rihanna’s music video for Work, is a family-run, unassuming spot for some of the city’s best West Indian cuisine. Finally, Ascari Enoteca, named after 1950s Italian racing legend Alberto Ascari, is a Leslieville favourite. Serving up plates of handmade pasta paired with perfect wine matches, it’s known as the date-night spot by neighbourhood denizens.If you’re heading back to the area for some fun after dark, the hottest spot at the moment is the Rooftop Bar at the Broadview Hotel. Housed in a historic building dating back to 1891, this newly renovated space, featuring industrial chic decorative touches, offers unmatched views of the city skyline. Another hotspot is the Vatican Gift Shop, where patrons step through a secret door, in what from the outside appears to be an unassuming storefront, into a neon-lit basement speakeasy to enjoy live music and a cocktail (or two).Get artsy on Queen Street West. From its independent galleries and hip bars to high-end boutiques, this street, which stretches from Roncesvalles to central Toronto, is an urban trekker’s dream. Get those cameras out – you won’t want to miss a photo-op next to the many murals that  Queen Street West. Don’t be surprised if you wander into one of the many galleries and get handed a complementary glass of wine at an exhibition opening if you’re around in the early evening.Local creatives flock to Queen Street West to share their crafts – so store-hopping is a must. Find your new favourite vintage rock T-shirt from F as in Frank. Or what about bespoke lipstick, fused together right before your eyes at Bite Beauty Lab? If simplicity with a conscience is your thing, check out KOTN, a homegrown clothing label committed to quality essentials, ethically made, and honestly priced. Owner Ben Sehl’s store, bordering popular Trinity Bellwoods Park, is a reflection of the city’s bubbling creativity.‘The balance makes Toronto such a great city, and the ersity keeps it interesting – there’s always something new to discover.’ Ben Sehl, owner of KOTNNeed to fuel up from all that wandering? A quick grab-and-go prosciutto sandwich from Forno Cultura is a great option for those on the run. Or take a break at Terroni, a hometown casual eatery with simple and delicious Italian fare, paired with an exclusive list of wines from Italy. For a snack, feed your pastry and caffeine cravings at award-winning Sam James Coffee Bar across from Trinity Bellwoods Park. For an exquisite, once-in-a-lifetime experience, Alo, which has topped Canada’s 100 best restaurants list three years in a row, combines French cuisine with local seasonal ingredients for an eye-opening culinary experience.Finally, when dusk falls, romantic cocktail bars and hideaways come to life on Queen West. For the crowd, head to the Drake Hotel, where parties are held across three levels (basement to rooftop bar) each weekend. For something less flashy, a 10-minute walk north to Dundas Street West brings you to Cocktail Bar, where delicious cocktails meet refined snacks. Finally, bring your A-game to Apartment 200 — perhaps the city’s trendiest bar, where Toronto’s top DJs go for a spin.Toronto has one of the world’s biggest Chinatowns, so it’s no surprise that it’s a fixture of the city. Chinatown is a fine option for planning a day excursion filled with activities. Start off with selfies at the Art Gallery of Ontario, especially with the world-acclaimed Yayoi Kusama Infinity Mirrors installation. Then, prepare yourself for a food adventure.For an authentic dim sum experience, order your har gow and siu mai off the menu at Rol San Restaurant. Need a quick fix? Swatow offers cheap and plentiful food – order the signature wonton noodle soup or Yeung Chow fried rice (note: These portions are huge.) For a snack, Juicy Dumpling is the easy option – where six soup dumplings start at less than £1.In recent times, the area has also become a hub for street style with world-class stores sprawled along Spadina Avenue. Check out Nomad Toronto, carrying everything from Issey Miyake and Comme des Garcons to the self-styled “internet street apparel” available at local hang Creeps, which is run by an all-female cast. Around the corner is Better Gift Shop. Owned by Avi Gold, who has collaborated with big-time retailers such as Dover Street Market, it offers a collection of unique international brands and local wears, catering for all your unique souvenir needs.‘An impressively wide range of ersity in cuisine and quality at a fair price defines Toronto’s food scene. There are many high-end, world-class establishments, as well as accessible spots that a visitor could enjoy and find affordable.’ Sam James, owner of Sam James Coffee BarDespite being known as a foodie’s paradise, Chinatown is the ultimate spontaneous night out. Enjoy a lychee cocktail underneath the glowing lanterns at Big Trouble in Little China, named after the 1986 fantasy martial arts film. Then, if you’re gutsy enough, head to B Boss KTV to belt it all out. Whether it’s Ed Sheeran, Spice Girls, or Mariah Carey, the private karaoke has a great collection of songs and fun disco lighting.Ready to explore Toronto?

Drag queens are known for their exaggerated makeup: false eyelashes, bold brows and extreme contouring are all commonplace. So, too, is a lot of glitter (and to do Drag Race shimmer sustainably see options here and here). Importantly, whether comical, cartoonish or comparatively subtle, drag makeup is always on point. Here are the tips and tricks that translate from the werk room into everyday makeup looks, according to former Drag Race contestants.It sounds like a cliche, but good makeup starts with good skin. The best makeup tip is to drink water – not just while you put your makeup on, but generally. It plumps up your skin and makes it glow.Your foundation shade should always resemble your skin tone. Skin comes in different tones – this applies to all skin colours – so some people have warm tones, some have cool tones. One thing I often see is orange foundation with pink necks.People always ask me how to apply glitter and sparkles. You can stick crystals on your face with eyelash glue, the same for glitter. The trick is taking your time, using a fine angled brush and being quite precise. Then there’s how to take glitter off – because if you just wash your face, then you will end up with glitter everywhere for days. Instead, get some Sellotape and press it on to the glitter to remove. That will leave you properly glitter-free.If you are in a rush, then pick up your black eyeshadow and don’t put it down until you are done. You can use it for eyeliner, eyebrows, your eyeshadow crease – so just do them all at once, using one angled brush.I tend to do my brows using a gold liquid liner, which really adds a pop. I have even done it as a boy, when I have been going out to a club. It baffles me that people use tape or card to draw on their eyeliner wings – it’s not that hard to draw a straight line at a 45-degree angle! It looks manufactured and just makes me think that you failed art class.Drag makeup is designed to pop. The minute you walk in a room you’re going to catch everyone’s eye because your features are so exaggerated. I love the transformation that I create using makeup and I love knowing that people in the back row can see every detail.I call my face a Frankenstein face because there’s no one brand that I use on every single area. I use Kryolan and Mac foundation, all different kinds of eyeshadow, and liquid lipsticks from Anastasia. It’s a good idea to play and experiment.I use liquid lipsticks because they stay put. I’m not one of these dainty queens who has to have a straw – honey, I’m using my mouth. I’m eating, I’m drinking, I’m talking and I need lipsticks that stay where they are supposed to. You can also use liquid lipsticks for eye colour.Your eyebrows should be at least close relatives – if possible, twin sisters. When it comes to eye makeup, you don’t have to paint with all the colours of the rainbow. I’ve seen a lot of people who have obviously bought an eyeshadow palette that has five colours, and then put all five colours on their eyelids without blending them. The main technique is to go from light to dark, from the brow bone down to your eyelid. Then just blend everything.My go-to lipstick right now is anything nude – for me that means a muted, matt grey-toned pink colour. Currently I use Sugarpill Cosmetics Liquid Lip Colour in Trifle. It’s easy and it complements any makeup look. If you wear red and it bleeds out, you can look as if you’ve bitten into a red berry, but that doesn’t happen with nudes.I take as much time on my makeup as I do in creating a look or preparing for a performance and I think that is why drag queens tend to look so good. Beyond makeup techniques, it’s really down to time and preparation.RuPaul’s Drag Race UK starts on BBC Three on 3 October at 8pm and will be exclusively available on BBC iPlayer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4c0288ed047fd2289d27c15bdc3e693b906e70/0_0_1794_1200/master/1794.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=583b734a5dcd9ab5057066c8fc282383 1440w","title":"dolly wells doll and em good posture","story":"The actor and co-creator of Doll \u0026amp Em, who starred alongside Melissa McCarthy in Can You Ever Forgive Me?, talks about becoming a directorThe writer, actor and now director Dolly Wells moved to New York in the summer of 2014, leaving London, where she was born. It was for family reasons – her husband, who is half-American, missed home – but it coincided with a new phase of her career. That same year, the first season of the much-missed comedy Doll \u0026amp Em aired on HBO. She wrote and starred in it with her best friend, Emily Mortimer, and after years as a largely comedy actor, it established her as a writer worthy of serious attention.Brooklyn gave her the material she needed to make her big-screen directorial debut, Good Posture. “I felt in quite a bit of pain, moving to America, leaving my brothers and sisters, my mum, whatever my identity was,” she says. “Trying to work out if I would be a different person in this country.”It is a brisk autumnal morning, and in a hotel in London, Wells, 47, nurses a hot chocolate. She talks quickly and broadly, pegging out each corner of any point she is making, before settling on a conclusion somewhere in the middle, as if resolving an imaginary argument. Good Posture is a beautiful, slender and pleasingly off-key story about Lilian, a young woman who moves in with a withdrawn and famous author, Julia, and decides to make a documentary about her without having read any of her books. Their unusual relationship, maternal and not, forms the backbone of the story. It was the first thing Wells – who also directed it – had written without Mortimer. Still, Mortimer appears in it, as Julia, who spends a lot of time hiding away unseen in her room. (This was partly for practical reasons: Mortimer, “the best person in the world”, wanted to do it but only had three days, so Wells wrote her reclusiveness into the story.)Julia, the reluctant creator, is not the character Wells seems to identify with most, although you would be forgiven for thinking it might be, as getting the director to make Good Posture in the first place took some persuasion. She had worked with the director Jamie Adams on his 2014 film Black Mountain Poets. “Jamie said he thought I’d be a good storyteller. He said: ‘I think you should direct a film,’” she says. “And I kind of went: ‘Mmm, I’m all right, actually.’ I knew since I was younger that I wanted to direct, but it’s quite terrifying. I feel like: ‘What is it I’ve got to say that anyone wants to hear?’”Undeterred, Adams asked her again a year later, having brought in Maggie Monteith, a producer who had found the money. “He said: ‘I don’t think she’ll ask again if you say no a second time.’ Quite clever. So I said: ‘OK. I’ll do it.’” Then Wells had to come up with a story. “Up until now, I’d only ever written with Emily. And I think we have different styles. Em was saying yesterday that she’s really good at the plot and I’m really good at the dialogue, but I’m probably a bit more chaotic. Also, I quite like not telling everything, leaving bits out. That’s the kind of films I enjoy.”She knew she wanted to write a coming-of-age story about a young woman. A younger cousin had stayed with a writer in New York and she thought that was interesting. “Emily’s mother was asking me last night: ‘How did you get the idea for the mother and daughter?’ It sounds so weird, but I don’t remember, and that often happens when I have ideas. I can remember knowing I had 35 days before we were going to shoot it, and trying to write it ...”The shoot was in a month and she hadn’t written anything? She nods, smiling. Does she normally leave things until the last minute? “No,” she says, still nodding. “A bit. Yes. With Doll \u0026amp Em, as well. I’m not good without a deadline.”Wells lights up most when talking about Lilian, the aimless woman at the centre of Good Posture, in her early 20s and desperately searching for purpose and love. It is a fond and tender portrait of a character who could have been insufferable. “Yeah, I love her. But people are horrified by her a bit, as well,” she says. In one scene, Lilian brazenly uses Julia’s toothbrush and towels. It is oddly uncomfortable to watch. “I know! This is too much information, but we were laughing yesterday about how, when you’re younger, you’d use the loo,” she leans in, “in a big way, at somebody’s house, and when you get older, you think: ‘I won’t.’” In her youth, Lilian is a little entitled and a little unfettered. “In a way, she’s trying to be Julia, and she doesn’t even know it. She’s trying to be a grownup woman.”As with Doll \u0026amp Em, Good Posture is fluent on the peculiar intricacies of female friendships. Wells finds them fascinating and romantic. When she was younger, she says, there were areas of her life in which she would feel validated by men’s approval. “But I think the real approval you get is through women, if you’re heterosexual. Because if it’s not a sexual relationship, you can get to the important parts. You’re not holding something back.”• Good Posture is released in the UK on 4 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4596e2e74b5f9d4e98c3aba47b0d842442423e05/568_461_1807_1084/master/1807.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a5668cc0217ccf356cf104e3625df90","title":"always cooking the same thing try a weekly food box","story":"In the days when Abel \u0026amp Cole was the only game in town, I blew very hot and cold on vegetable boxes. It was a lot like wearing a Fitbit: you’re filled with this round-the-clock reminder of your own virtue. You’re roasting beetroot while you wash up in the morning, your fridge is brimming with fennel à la grecque, you’re taking baked potatoes to work, the best bit of which is how many people you can tell about your thrift and wholesome living. Then wham, you have one week of compromised domestic engagement – which is US militaryspeak for being out on the razzle every night – and your vegetables are piling up like an accusation. Your heart turns against them. Is it in any way reasonable to send you a carrot in May, when you have been eating them all winter? (The Fitbit equivalent, by the way, is when it runs out of battery and you remember how livable life still is even when you have no idea how many steps you’ve done and may not have done any.)I went through this love-hate cycle a few times in the 00s, and in the meantime the world moved on. Complete meal subscription services took off, though in the beginning they were mainly for weight loss. This is a disaster, even if you’re doing it for research purposes and you have no intention of losing weight. You have a quinoa mountain in no time. You end up eating lentils for breakfast, but that’s so unholy that you have another breakfast on top of that. I tried the Balance Box for a month, once, for an article, and I think I ate it all as well as my regular food.The services have moved on again to include full-meal solutions for the time-poor, and fruit-and-vegetable solutions for those who hate the idea of food waste. I have just tried Hello Fresh for the first and Oddbox for the second and, broadly, everything that was wrong with either was really something wrong with me.Hello Fresh always seems to have an offer running, which brought the cost down by half to £2.50 per person per meal. A three-meal-a-week box for £15, for a couple, is completely reasonable. Yet the thrifty wartime homemaker in me was constantly complaining – maybe if I’d got the chicken from a market, at five in the morning, off the floor, it would have been cheaper. If anything, not having anything to complain about made it worse.But I just don’t think other people’s portions are big enough. There was plenty of nutrition in them more than plenty – over 1,400 calories a person in the cumin roast-pork recipe. But if I’d been making it myself, there would have been more on the plate. This put me in a scarcity mindset, which is a disaster for family harmony. I was being ridiculous.The recipes are simple but quite bold in flavour, the ingredients are good, the instructions are very clear, especially if you don’t mind being addressed like someone who has never handled meat before (I am way too old to be told to wash my hands), and the repertoire is good. There’s always a cute touch, an aubergine you weren’t expecting, some blue cheese sauce. Unless you specify “quick”, they don’t try to keep everything down to half an hour. I really admire this service, in almost every particular I just don’t like being told what to do, and always like to have too much on the table.With Oddbox, I could overcater like wild. It was £13.50 for a vegetable-only box for a large family, which isn’t us, because the children eat only peas. With a tiny adjustment to regular life – eating kale by choice – this makes it cheaper than buying veg in a shop. It’s explicitly thrifty in a broader, social sense, on food miles and – sorry, the main point – it’s food that would otherwise have been thrown away because the producers couldn’t sell it. There was either too much of it for the supermarkets or it supposedly looked funny, though, in fact, none of it did.This is a radical leap forward from the old days. I have never had baby courgettes by subscription before, and only very rarely seen chicory. Sure, there were onions, potatoes and carrots, lettuce, broccoli, fennel, spinach – these are not endangered species – but I have nothing against staples as long as there is fancy stuff. I made algarve carrots, the ones they give you in bars to make you drink more, and creamed spinach, like ordering a stroke in a classic French bistro. I shaved fennel and put chilli on broccoli and made hasselback potatoes for the hell of it. The only thing I had left was the lettuce, and I gave that to a rabbit. My fridge looked like a delicatessen, I smelled constantly of garlic, I finished a load of kippers I had in the freezer because I’m not, when it really comes down to it, a vegetarian, and, once again, I felt high all week on my own virtue.I would recommend either service for a person who is hungry, and doesn’t want to surrender to the unchanging menus of their own conformity. But for the self-righteous, there is nothing like a box of invisibly deformed vegetables."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79cb415d490670d572226a7cda8c4d8ccf2b0140/0_79_1937_1162/master/1937.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39a95cd162cb45144e40ceaf08db59a8","title":"england squad abraham tomori alli lingard wan bissaka","story":"Chelsea’s Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham have been called up by England for the Euro 2020 qualifiers in the Czech Republic and Bulgaria but there is no place for Dele Alli or Jesse Lingard.Other notable absentees are Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had been in the previous squad, and Kyle Walker, who has again been omitted. Wan-Bissaka did not play for Manchester United on Monday because of injury and pulled out of the most recent England squad with a back problem. Kieran Trippier and Trent Alexander-Arnold have been selected as the right-backs.Tomori, a central defender, has been called up for the first time and two other Chelsea players have been included by Gareth Southgate: Mason Mount and Ross Barkley.Alli might have hoped for a recall after his return to fitness but Southgate has preferred Barkley, Mount and James Maddison in the more creative midfield positions. There is also a place in the squad for Fabian Delph.Southgate said of Tomori: “His profile as a defender fits with the way international football is. Athleticism is important he is capable with the ball. We think it’s a good opportunity to have a closer look at him.”Tomori and Abraham are also eligible to play for Nigeria and, in the defender’s case, Canada but Southgate said he would not use them in a competitive game to close that door.Southgate said Abraham, who has two caps and has scored eight goals in his past 10 Chelsea games, had “really grasped this opportunity at the start of the season” but that Lingard’s less impressive form had led to the United midfielder’s omission. “Jesse has had a difficult period,” said Southgate, though he emphasised that he had “huge faith” in Lingard.He indicated that Callum Hudson-Odoi, just back from injury, would be included in the Under-21 squad named on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a88f2d4286524b9c7b561221a1599b5bf9af2595/0_323_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5218ce89384aaf46758fc05ca79ec988","title":"mohamed salah inspired me become muslim liverpool islam","story":"I have gone from hating Islam to becoming a Muslim – and the Liverpool forward is the principal reason for thatMohamed Salah really and honestly inspired me. I’m a Nottingham Forest season-ticket holder, I can be myself but because I made the declaration of faith I’m a Muslim. I’m still me and that’s what I took from Mohamed Salah. I’d love to meet him, just to shake his hand and say “Cheers” or “Shukran”.I don’t think my mates quite believe that I’m a Muslim because I’ve not really changed. I just think my heart is better. I’m really trying to change on match days. Normally it’s pub, put a bet on, then after the game back to the pub and realise you’ve lost a lot of money. It’s hard when you’re used to such a culture and it’s part of football for a lot of people.I’m embarrassed to say this but my opinions on Islam used to be that the religion, the culture and the people were backward that they didn’t integrate and wanted to take over. I always looked at Muslims like the elephant in the room. I had a hatred of Muslims.When I was in sixth form it was a period where I think I needed someone to blame for my misfortunes. Unfortunately Muslims got the brunt of it and I quickly discovered right-wing media pages. They sort of groomed me by sending me long propaganda pieces and suchlike.Even though I had these horrible ideas of Islam, I would never say them to a Muslim. At this point I didn’t know any Muslims. My degree in Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Leeds changed everything.We had to do a dissertation and I wanted to do something a bit different. I remember my dyslexia tutor telling me: “What about Mohamed Salah’s song?” I was aware of it and I thought it was fantastic but I hadn’t considered it in those terms.I finally got the question: “Mohamed Salah, a gift from Allah. Is the performance of Mohamed Salah igniting a conversation that combats Islamapobia within the media and political spheres?”The Liverpool fans’ song – to the tune of Dodgy’s hit Good Enough – includes the line “If he scores another few then I’ll be Muslim too”, and I literally took that to heart.I was a typical white-boy student who went to a different city, would get absolutely hammered and lived the student life. My degree was the first time I learned about Islam in an academic way.University gave me the opportunity to meet a lot of students from Saudi Arabia. I thought they were evil people who carried swords but they’re the nicest people I’ve met. The conceptions I had about Arab countries completely dissolved.Mohamed Salah was the first Muslim I could relate to. It’s the way he lives his life, how he talks to people. The other week he posed for a picture with a Liverpool fan who suffered a broken nose chasing after him. I know some other footballers would do that but you expect it now from Salah.At university I interviewed Egyptian students and when they found out my research was about “Mohamed Salah, a gift from Allah” – which is also another Liverpool song – they would talk to me for hours about how great he is and what he’s done for their country. One million Egyptians spoiled their ballots and voted for him to be president last year.One of the Egyptians I talked to told me that Salah encompasses what being a Muslim is, following Islam correctly. He believed that Salah is making people love Muslims again.That really resonated with me. When Salah scores I think he’s scoring for the faith. When he won the Champions League I said to my friend that was a victory for Islam. After each of his goals Salah practises the sujood (prostration) and exposes a very Islamic symbol to the world. How many people watch the Premier League every week? Millions globally.Salah showed me that you can be normal and a Muslim, if that’s the right phrase. You can be yourself. He’s a great player and is respected by the football community and his politics, his religion, don’t matter – and to me that’s what football can do.When people read the Quran, or read about Islam, they see something different that is not always portrayed in the media. I’m new to the Islamic community and I’m still learning. It is hard. It’s a lifestyle change.What would I say to the Ben of old? I’d give him a smack, to be honest, and I’d say: ‘How dare you think like that about a people that are so erse. You need to start talking to people. You need to start asking the questions.’ We live in a multicultural, multifaith, multinational society.Last season Chelsea fans were singing “Salah is a bomber”. That’s the first time on my social media that I had a right go.

Photographs and video by Achilleas ZavallisThe last day of 14-year-old Raja Hamid Yahya al-Oud’s life began like any other.She got up early along with the rest of the family because there was always a lot of work to do on the farm in the spring planting season. White drones had intermittently circled above their cornfields for the last few weeks, but there was no sign of them that morning.Raja and her mother, Amira, liked to take breaks under the acacia trees about 200 metres from the house. At 4pm, this was to become her final resting place.The plane was flying too high for them to hear it coming but Amira said the sound the CBU-52 BB cluster bomb made as it rained 220 deadly submunitions on their heads will stay with her forever. Some exploded on impact while others, still armed, fell into the fields.Screaming for her daughter, Amira saw Raja’s twisted body under a small tree. Her jaw and entire right side had been ripped apart and blood had already dyed the sand around her black. A neighbour, Hamoud Mohammed al-Ghar, dodged the remaining submunitions to pick Raja up and then ran with her to the nearest road to find a car to take her to hospital. “I knew the girl was already dead,” he said. “But I had to try.” The drones circled ahead the entire time.Raja died on 23 March 2018. But the story of the bomb that is believed to have killed her stretches back decades earlier. Using the serial number and other technical information on the CBU-52 BB’s outer shell, the  traced the munition from its manufacture in Milan, Tennessee, to Sahar farms, in north Yemen, where it ended a child’s life.Cluster munitions were invented by the Nazis and had become a standard weapon of war across the world by the 1970s, designed to kill as many people as possible.They usually consist of a hollow shell filled with hundreds of submunitions that disperse over an area as big as several football pitches as it falls through the air. They either explode on impact or are triggered when moved or stepped on, firing hundreds of fragments of metal that travel at the speed of bullets.The submunitions remain a threat for decades once deployed and those from older designs often resemble shiny silver orbs around the size of a tennis ball, making unexploded ordnance especially attractive to curious children. Hundreds of people worldwide die each year after coming into contact with unexploded cluster bombs, with about 300 casualties a year in Vietnam alone.In 2008 an international treaty called the convention on cluster munitions severely limiting the use, transfer and stockpiling of cluster bombs was adopted by 30 countries. By 2018 it had been signed by 120 states. The US, which sells arms to Saudi-led forces fighting in Yemen, was not one of them.“Cluster munitions went through a proportionality test to measure military advantages gained versus civilian harm of their use,” said Rawan Shaif, the lead Yemen researcher at the open source investigative organisation Bellingcat, of the Geneva conventions relating to the protection of victims of armed conflict. “There’s no military advantage in using a cluster munition in a farm, unless your aim is to make that area uninhabitable for generations of civilians and military alike.”The cluster bomb that killed Raja was manufactured at the Milan Army Ammunition Plant in 1977. The large site, just north of Jackson in west Tennessee, encompasses 231 miles (372km) of roads and 88 miles (142km) of railways and is nicknamed Bullet Town by residents.Milan’s fortunes have risen and fallen with that of the plant: work there has ebbed and flowed with America’s wars. Most of its ordnance and mortar production lines have been moved to Iowa by American Ordnance, the private contractor operating the plant. In 2013 it employed just 113 people, down from a peak of 10,000 during the second world war. By 1977 thousands of cluster bombs like the one that killed Raja were rolling off the production line. The US no longer manufactures CBU-52s: it has long since upgraded to “smart” computer-guided cluster bombs with supposedly more accurate arming and targeting systems. One possible reason a 1977 bomb found its way to Sahar farms, in Yemen, in 2018 is because the US has such a large stockpile of the weapons.In the interim, a good way of reducing the stockpile of outdated weapons – and making some money – was to sell them. Data from 2017 showed the US still had some 2.2m cluster bombs in its arsenal.“Many nations, including the US, Germany, and Switzerland, have taken steps in recent years to bolster both their pre-export due diligence, and their post-delivery verification methods,” said Nic Jenzen-Jones, the director of Armament Research Services, a specialist technical intelligence consultancy. “Nonetheless, there are a lot of arms that have been exported prior to these changes that muddy the waters in terms of how researchers can track and trace items of interest.”The US has been selling weapons, planes, tanks and ordnance to Saudi Arabia for decades and permitting its arms manufacturers to export: it has licensed $138bn (£112bn) to the kingdom in the last 10 years alone, according to research by the US thinktank the Center for International Policy. Officials under Barack Obama worried that sales, after Riyadh launched its air campaign against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels in March 2015, could amount to complicity in war crimes under international laws that could name the US as a co-belligerent, but in 2016 went ahead with a $1.3bn sale anyway.Bomb sales continue: Donald Trump, who has made Saudi Arabia the cornerstone of his Middle East policy, overrode objections from Congress in March to complete the sale of more than $8bn worth of weapons to Riyadh, its coalition partner the United Arab Emirates coalition partner, and Jordan.The total extent of export licences to the kingdom is not known, and neither is it known when the bomb that killed Raja was sold. The SIPRI Arms Transfers Database, the world’s most extensive record, yielded no results: it contains just a fraction of true sales, as pre-digital record-keeping was poor and states cite national security concerns to avoid disclosing records.It is possible the CBU could have been sold by the US years ago to a third party state and then sold on again to Saudi Arabia: cluster bomb sales to Riyadh were officially stopped in 2016. The US Department of Defense and the state department did not respond to requests for information. Such inquiries are usually met with no comment.Washington says US supplies of “smart weapons” are helping the coalition reduce civilian casualties – but as Raja’s death shows, old US-made dumb bombs are still being used.What we do know is Sahar farms was bombed on 23 March last year after the area had been surveyed by drones for weeks. “We are just farmers,” Hamid Yahya al-Oud, Raja’s father, said over tea in his living room, surrounded by his six remaining children. “Look outside. There’s our well, there’s our goats. Why would there be Houthis here?”At the time of publication, the coalition had not responded to the ’s requests for comment.Sahar farms lies in the countryside of Saada in north Yemen, the Houthi heartland on Saudi Arabia’s border. The whole province is littered with bombed-out buildings, bridges, roads and unexploded ordnance. The green cigar-like shell of the CBU-52 BB cluster bomb is one of the most common of those dropped on the area, according to Abdullah Umayyad, the manager of the UN-funded Yemen Executive Mine Action Centre (Yemac) field office in Saada.The coalition rarely acknowledges civilian casualties from airstrikes, making justice or even simple answers for affected families about why they were targeted almost impossible.“It took two days to clear out Sahar farms after that strike,” said Umayyad. “The work is very dangerous. Three men have been killed in clearance operations here in Saada. My old boss lost his hands, eyes and nose after trying to disarm a cluster bomb submunition last year.”Despite condemnation from human rights groups over airstrikes in Yemen, Yemac’s records suggest more cluster bombs are being dropped on Saada than ever: at least 147 cluster munitions were recovered in the province in the first six months of 2019, up on 122 in the same period of 2018.Its record-keeping, however, is spotty and inidual items are not catalogued. Questions of who, what and why when it comes to bombings fall outside its remit: the political fallout could impact the team’s ability to work across the war-torn country.US-made bombs rain down on north Yemen with almost total impunity.At Sahar farms, the drones have been back in the last two months. “They already killed my daughter,” said Hamid. “Now they’re back for more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76a0e758379b04a4fa612f19631921d6a87ef4f7/0_1_2281_1369/master/2281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40b8723519305c0afa200526177ed3e6","title":"with the greatest disrespect how her majestys press offers its candid friendship","story":"The Duchess of Sussex may think she has a good case in her legal battle with the media. But just look at how these other royals fared …Has there every been a more cruelly miscast “candid friend” to the royal family than Her Majesty’s Press, who are neither truly candid, nor remotely the sort of people one knows socially? And, yes, I obviously include myself in that.In any case, the ONLY acceptable way to look at the royal family is that practised by Princess Michael of Kent, of whom the Queen is once said to have remarked: “She’s rather grand for us.” (Remember: children of former Nazis always marry down.) Unfortunately, this simple shtick has not been grasped by so many of our great newspapers. They embody Sybil Fawlty’s lament over Basil’s relationship with the guests: “You never get it right, do you? You’re either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrined puff adder.”And so with the royal press. Either they’re wanking on fawningly for 15 pages about some wedding we probably ought not to have paid for, where every guest without exception hates and pities them. Or they’re making the word BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH stretch over those same 15 pages, and imagining it counts as fair comment for some minor violation of a quid-pro-quo policy that only they understand, and whose impenetrable rules they change every three minutes anyway.For some decades, my favourite reaction has been the mad leader columns in which the paper in question rants about what they are OWED by whichever prince or princess has denied them #content of some form or other. These are the journalistic equivalent of screaming in the street that a woman should have sex with you because you bought her a drink. Or, in this case, bought a titchy percentage of her drink as a UK taxpayer. In any other arena it would be regarded as certifiably embarrassing behaviour.And with that, we must narrow our frame of reference to the “select media outlets” – print and TV – that have spent the past year or so affectlessly tormenting Prince Harry and his wife Meghan for clicks, yet are now calling for the smelling salts because the couple have decided to launch a legal action.There is, as we know, no snowflake like a freedom-of-speech snowflake. Freedom of speech being the sole human right these particular papers and TV pundits recognise, there is now a great outpouring of “candid friendship” warning the couple that they have gone too far by speaking freely. Freedom of speech is a one-way street, and the last thing people who are a distant sixth in line to the throne, and receding from it fast, should be behaving like is slightly crap celebrities.And yet, and yet … is it? I hate to point out the obvious, but the series of events that would lead to Harry and Meghan becoming operational and actually taking the throne would be so immense, sensational and horrifyingly multi-corpsed, that – were it to happen – editors probably wouldn’t mind any more which mode of transport they had taken back from a trip to New York two years before. So what does any of it matter? A Google summit in Italy, charity editorship of Vogue, a private jet to Elton’s house, something-or-other in the royal box at Wimbledon, refusing to show what one paper called “all of Archie” to the photographers – these wouldn’t be quite the major deal they are laughably imagined at the moment.Having said all that, we papers have got to stick together. So in the spirit of colleaguery, I am very pleased to offer the lawyers of the newspapers in question a series of historical precedents I have unearthed from the global archives – all of which relate to other royal women who were no better than they should be. I believe they show why your current approach is the right one, and offer them humbly for presentation to the courts in due course.We are saddened to learn you claim “distress” at our meticulous coverage of public-interest questions regarding your fingers. The public are very interested in them. As you know, our article Does Anne Boleyn Have Six Fingers? was one of the very first newspaper questions to which the answer is “no”. We pride ourselves on our pack-leading journalism. Our coverage of this issue amounted to valuable – estimable – public service journalism, and no one will ever say that you have six fingers again. Certainly not for centuries, still, even when it is definitely untrue. However, you need to understand that this generous service on our behalf is a two-way street, and it is time for you to honour your side of the bargain. Why will you not repeatedly sit for our portraitist, displaying all your fingers, in a manner that would quell residual gossip? What is it you have to hide? Is it a rudimentary finger? People are beginning to ask again, and it is only right that we report their allegations. Furthermore, I am afraid your failure to understand our mutually beneficial relationship means we have had to run a portrait using Photoshoppe, which is captioned: “How Anne Boleyn might look if she had six fingers.” We are saddened to have been driven to this. Please consider our feelings.We must caution Your Majesty against your frankly hysterical complaint regarding our hugely popular, long-running front-page series Is Queen Bess a Maid Or No? Like many newspapers, we breathed a sigh of relief when an investigation found your mother, Anne Boleyn, was killed not by a relentless campaign of conspiracist shittery, but by an executioner’s blade. A reminder that gossip doesn’t kill people – swords do. Alas, it is a great and most portentous sadness to us to find you repeating some of her mistakes. While during her life we shat on her every week for everything, to the point where she presumably didn’t know whether she was coming or going, we now speak of her as someone who got it absolutely, tragically right always as far as dealing with us is concerned. She was a saint. She worked with us. You should, too. What’s the worst that could happen?We were disappointed to receive your extraordinary complaint over our coverage of your attendance of the Galileo summit in Italy. This newspaper has made no secret of its concerns over Mr Galileo’s fashionable theories that the Earth goes round the sun, or of our concerns that he is being manipulated in a way we cannot quite put our finger on, but which will allow us to maintain our policy of thinking his insistent warnings probably aren’t really that big of a deal. Without wishing to lapse into technical jargon, we are confident that he will “get his” in due course. Above all, your complaint reeked of hypocrisy from top to bottom: you also like to tell us that the world is round, but you were pictured walking on flat earth on your arrival. Both things cannot be true.We are extremely concerned by the emotional and eccentric tone of your complaint regarding a thoroughbred stallion with whom you have been linked. It would appear from your highly unconventional and unseemly missive that you think we said you had sex with a horse, and you go on to say – in emotional terms, not befitting an imperial majesty – that you didn’t. But if you look closely at what we published, you will see that all we said was that some people on the internet were saying you had sex with a horse. This is a matter of fact. They were saying it. At least two of them, one of whom may or may not be our chief reporter’s secret account. We have the greatest of respect for our readers and present them with such things in order that they may make their own judgments. Ergo, you have insulted our readers. If anything, we are now the ones being traduced by you. We would really question the wisdom of getting angry about things you ought more regally to accept. We think you’ll find it’s counterproductive. VERY counterproductive."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ef577c021e643d88b4c741dbab13b5cf0c67b53/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8126f40e2940146cd61355a6175d9019","title":"gaining my religion kanye dylan and the pop stars who find god","story":"Kanye West has reportedly said he will only be recording gospel from now on – following a trail blazed with mixed results by Bob Dylan, Cat Stevens and Reverend RunReligion has always been a popular option for celebrities in urgent need of a fresh start because God, unlike Twitter, has a reputation for forgiveness. Kanye West launched his weekly Sunday Service in January after a whirlwind few months during which he swooned over Donald Trump, suggested that slavery was a choice and released the first forgettable album of his career. West has had an inconsistent relationship with his faith. His 2004 single Jesus Walks earned him multiple nominations for Stellar awards (the gospel Grammys) but I Am a God, from the album Yeezus, did not. On the verge of releasing his long-delayed ninth album, Jesus Is King, he seems to be going all in. At a recent listening party, he reportedly declared that he was done with secular music and would be recording only gospel from now on.In the 1960s, soul music was largely defined by charismatic young gospel stars such as Sam Cooke and Aretha Franklin crossing over to secular music, but travelling in the opposite direction poses more of a challenge. While mainstream listeners are by no means allergic to overt expressions of faith — witness, for example, U2, Stormzy, Johnny Cash and vast swathes of reggae — the zeal of the convert is a tougher sell.For one thing, the music can be offputtingly didactic. When Bob Dylan unveiled his conversion to Christianity on a trilogy of albums starting with 1979’s Slow Train Coming, his hectoring intensity made his early protest songs sound like polite suggestions. For another, a born-again artist’s take-it-or-leave-it repositioning guarantees what Spinal Tap would call more selective appeal.When Cat Stevens converted to Islam in 1977 and changed his name to Yusuf Islam, he left the music business and didn’t make headlines again until, 12 years later, he popped up to endorse Ayatollah Khomeini’s fatwa against Salman Rushdie (comments he has since denied). Since the rapper Malice, formerly of the Clipse, found God and cunningly renamed himself No Malice in 2012, he has retreated into the niche of Christian hip-hop. His guest verse on Jesus Is King will be the first time mainstream listeners have heard him in years. Even Rev Al Green, whose unbroken run of gospel albums during the 80s and early 90s was warmly received, disappeared from the charts during that period apart from a duet with Annie Lennox, Put a Little Love in Your Heart. To reject secular music is inevitably to sacrifice sales and profile to a higher calling.An artist can still make a healthy living in the gospel industry (especially if, like West, you sell Holy Spirit sweatshirts and Jesus Walks socks), but it’s notable that the biggest-selling gospel album of all time remains Aretha Franklin’s Amazing Grace, the 1971 live album in which the minister’s daughter paid tribute to her roots, before returning to soul on subsequent records. Many profoundly religious artists choose to remain in the world of secular music. Joseph Simmons of Run DMC is an ordained minister, but the only album he has released under the name Rev Run, 2005’s Distortion, was no sermon. Born-again Christian Dave Mustaine continues to tour with Megadeth, although he has refused to appear on the same bill as a band called Rotting Christ. It’s perfectly possible to live according to your faith without letting it dominate your music.Even those artists who firmly reject secular music tend to have second thoughts eventually. In 1962, Little Richard, who had left rock’n’roll to study theology, was talked into a European comeback tour. On the opening night, fans who expected to hear the hits booed his strictly-gospel set while cheering support act Sam Cooke. The following night, Little Richard abruptly changed tack, kicking off with Long Tall Sally. Showmanship triumphed over spirituality. Similarly, Dylan began his 1980 Slow Train Coming tour by banishing all of his secular material, but when he returned to the road in the autumn, Like a Rolling Stone and Blowin’ in the Wind were back in the set. You can do what you believe God wants you to do, but God isn’t buying concert tickets. With his 1983 album Infidels, Dylan returned to secular music and most of his fans sighed with relief. “Dylan’s audience did not take kindly to hearing their hero parroting beliefs that many of them had already rejected,” said Rolling Stone.West’s Sunday Services have certainly helped rehabilitate his reputation and provided him with an invigorating new arena, but the sincerity of his commitment is debatable so long as he displays neither humility nor repentance. “It feels like Kanye himself is the centre and the object of this worship,” wrote Naima Cochrane in a damning Vice article this year. His alleged rejection of secular music should therefore be taken with a pinch of salt. For someone as ambitious as West to continue down a path that is bound to bring him less attention and more limited success really would be a miracle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9f5bb99dab94112861340558023e4cd4c8b1096/23_0_978_587/master/978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ad098c17794f3a0540fe411b68214a0","title":"ustwo austin kelmore union organiser sacked games","story":"Ustwo denies Austin Kelmore’s dismissal is anything to do with union activitiesA leading organiser of a new trade union branch set up to represent games sector workers has been sacked by an award-winning UK games company in what his union claims is an attempt to clamp down on the nascent movement.Austin Kelmore was working as a senior developer for Ustwo and had been one of the three core developers on Assemble with Care, one of the major game releases this year by its Bafta award-winning studio.The company, which describes itself as a “fampany” in a nod to a blend of corporate and family values, is known outside of gaming circles as the creator of Monument Valley, whose sales rose after Kevin Spacey’s character was shown playing it in the political drama House of Cards.Internal emails show executives complained that Kelmore was “spending too much time on ersity programmes” and “always putting leadership figures on the spot”.Kelmore, who is chair of Games Workers of the UK (GWU), is alleged to have been informed in late September that he would be put on gardening leave and then dismissed. This is alleged to have happened a few weeks after he was asked by a senior manager about his union activity and just after he had invited a group of Ustwo employees to a meeting to discuss rights at work.It is understood that Kelmore was informed by the company that he was being let go for performance reasons.The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), of which the games workers’ union is a branch, has given the company until Friday to reverse the decision before it files legal action.Kelmore, a US national who came to the UK on a visa for skilled workers, fears that his family’s presence in the country could be put at risk by the termination of his contract.Jamie Cross, the UK branch secretary of the GWU, said: “Despite Ustwo’s claims of being as much a family as it is a company, it has decided to leave Austin, one of its best developers, completely orphaned.“Austin and his family are not only left without their main source of income but also unsure if they will have to uproot their whole lives and leave the country in a few weeks. The union will not stand idly by in the face of this unlawful and vicious act and is determined to fight back until this decision is reversed, either voluntarily or through the courts.”In an internal email from October 2018, the human resources department at Ustwo criticised Kelmore for spending time on “company feedback, ersity schemes and working practices” and said he “puts leadership … on the spot”.The email continued: “It feels that Austin is a self-appointed bastion of change and sometimes speaks on behalf of others.”It added: “The studio runs as a collective ‘we’ rather than leadership v employees, which may have been Austin’s experience in the past, but it’s not how things are here.”Kelmore, who has 12 years’ experience in the industry and previously worked as a developer for the award-winning US games studio PopCap, was one of a number of key programmers on Ustwo’s eagerly anticipated Apple Arcade release Assemble with Care, a narrative puzzle game.Alex Sobel, a Labour MP and vice-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on video games, called on Ustwo to reinstate Kelmore.“Every worker must be allowed the right to be a union member and to organise other workers,” he said. “The issues that are present in the video games industry are sometimes unique and games studios should welcome the organisation of their workforce to engage on these issues.”A spokesperson for Ustwo said: “Austin Kelmore is currently an employee of Ustwo Games and will be leaving in the near future for reasons unconnected to his membership of a trade union or his undertaking trade union activities. We have other employees who are members of trade unions. To respect Austin’s privacy, it is not appropriate for us to comment further on this matter.“Ustwo Games has been and will continue to be committed to ersity and inclusivity. We work hard to build a supportive work environment for all our employees.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

As the swing propels her backwards, she twists again as she throws herself down to the bottom bar before immediately flying back to the top.The connection was invented by Beth Tweddle, Britain’s greatest female gymnast, and it is widely considered one of the most difficult in the world. Downie believes it can drive her to secure the world or Olympic uneven bar medal she has been chasing for 12 years.For many other gymnasts, just the first skill alone, the Tweddle, is impossible. When I ask Ellie Downie, Becky’s sister and the 2017 European all around champion, if she has ever tried the Tweddle, she laughs in my face: “We debated trying that but I can barely hang in that grip because I’m just too stiff.” Alice Kinsella, who won the European title on beam this year, simply closes her eyes and shakes her head: “I’ve never tried it. People say: ‘Will I try it?’ But I just don’t think it’s for me. Like, no. I think I’ll stick with the normal one.”Downie’s abnormal skill selection complements a career that has been far from regular. For a while, it seemed like it would be defined by her bitter 2012, where after being Britain’s second-in-command behind Tweddle for five years, the first major team she did not make was for her home Olympics. Downie was distraught, but in hindsight the snub lit a fire within. “That was heartbreaking because I had never not made a team in my career until that point,” she says. “That was really hard to take. But, for me, after that it was like: ‘OK how do I stop that from happening again? You have to be so good that they can’t not put you on a team.’”For seven years, Downie has been that good. After being known for much of her career as a supreme talent who struggled to maintain her composure with major medals on the line, her moment of reckoning came when she won the European championships on uneven bars in 2014, beating the Olympic champion Aliya Mustafina before retaining her title in 2016. When Great Britain confirmed their rise to the upper echelons of the sport by winning team bronze at the 2015 world championships, Downie was the leader and the team’s rock.Downie arrived at the 2016 Rio Olympics in the form of her life and with a great chance of finally winning her first medal. Instead, another Olympics left her heartbroken. Her routine in the preliminary rounds was excellent except for one freak error – her toe brushed the top bar, incurring one huge deduction. Without the deduction, she would have outscored the eventual bronze medalist. Instead, she left Brazil wondering if she had the strength to carry on.“For me, the most frustrating thing was that I beat the Olympic champion, Aliya Mustafina, eight weeks before at the European championships. So, it was there, the routine was there – I had to process that and think: ‘You were good enough.’”Downie’s latest battle has been the toughest injury of her career. After years of considering surgery to fix the fraying ligaments in her left elbow, she fell badly at the 2017 European championships and the ligaments snapped. When the doctors informed her that her elbow would have to undergo full reconstructive surgery, she wept: “There was a point where I was like: ‘I don’t know if I’m ever going to be able to do this again. If my elbow is not fully fixed, uneven bars is my piece so it’s game over.’ After initially being upset, I had to believe that it was going to get better. I was so over the top with my rehab! Every single hour I was icing it … I went into the gym within a couple of days after and was getting every other body part as strong as it could be so when I came back I could comeback well and quickly.”In order to return to gymnastics, Downie had to learn basic aspects of the sport anew. There was a time when just gripping the bar marked supreme progress. Her left side has always dominated her gymnastics, but her wonky left elbow meant that her comeback rested on learning how to twist to the right for the first time in her life.Now she has made it back, 2019 seems like a full-circle moment. In 2007, she made her world championship debut in Stuttgart, when the British team qualified for the Beijing Olympics and their era of success began. She returns as a seasoned veteran with a wealth of experience and a team no longer content with making up the numbers. She is desperate to draw from both failures and successes as she resumes her chase for the elusive medal.“It has been a mad process getting the bar routine together and how it’s all come about, but I’m excited to give it a go. It has been a process, it has been a journey, but it has been awesome.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/effb4979278d2550e983b293b991f8bc988e7b98/21_348_2608_1565/master/2608.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb8639dedcd4241e0bad83e9e9fe2d3c","title":"ben stokes play leeds northern superchargers hundred cricket","story":"“We’re in east London, it’s a new competition, and there’s a 43-year-old ECB guy wearing jeans,” says Rob Calder, by way of building anticipation. Calder is the commercial director of the Hundred, a tournament the ECB hopes will revolutionise the audience for cricket. He’s in Brick Lane to announce the “brand identities” of the teams taking part. And his video presentation keeps cutting out.“How about you all come back the same time next week”, Calder jokes to a room full of journalists not overly inclined to play along. The Hundred has, it seems fair to say, gone down like a cold cup of sick with a lot of people who have a stake in the game of cricket. The counties don’t like it, the fanbase doesn’t like it and the press has its collective eyebrows raised so high they’re practically leaping off their face. That Calder cannot get a carefully assembled montage of Ben Stokes in his Northern Super Chargers kit to work seems about right.Stokes is one of eight centrally contracted England players who will be the figureheads for the new city-based teams created especially for the competition. The Super Chargers, who are based in Leeds but not associated with Yorkshire, picked Stokes while the Southern Brave (singular), who will play at the Ageas Bowl but have nothing to do with Hampshire, chose Jofra Archer. Each team have also picked two “local heroes”, players who play for the counties that fall under the catchment area of the cities. If that sounds complicated, wait till you get to the bit where they’re making the overs 10 balls long.Why create a new competition when England are one-day world champions and attendances at this summer’s Vitality T20 Blast were the best they’ve ever been? It seems like change for change’s sake to many people, but listen to the players and they’re rather up for this Hundred lark. Well, they would be wouldn’t they, goes the response, with the top picks in the full draft taking place later this month set to earn £125,000 for five weeks’ work. But even applying the keenest of scrutiny it is hard to detect disingenuousness from the players who have signed up.Take Chris Woakes, England all-rounder, and the “red ball” (centrally contracted) pick of Birmingham Phoenix, the Edgbaston-based team who presumably did not take their name from the disastrous MG Rover takeover gang. Sitting in his New Balance-designed team shirt of peach and orange – and featuring the logo of Butterkist popcorn (KP snacks signed a deal to sponsor all the teams, with not a gambling logo in sight) – he was eager to act as ambassador for the format.“I think the brightness of the kit goes with the tournament”, he said. “It’s something new and I hope it helps to attract not just a new audience, but young kids and families to come to the venues and enjoy the competition.“It’s going to take a bit of bedding in and it will be interesting to see how teams go about it, but with 100 balls I think it’s going to be high scoring. It really will be. I’m excited about it all. I like the Hundred as a concept and I’m pleased to be a part of it.“We’ve got new people interested in the sport after the summer we’ve had with the World Cup and the Ashes. I think the Hundred is the best way to capitalise on that. It’s fast, it’s got the best players competing against each other, it’s on free to air television. I think that’s a huge one. I fell in love with the game through watching free to air television so hopefully that will be the same.”The Hundred will feature men’s and women’s competitions running concurrently next summer. The BBC will show 10 of the men’s 36 matches live though the England and Wales Cricket Board expects the national broadcaster to wholeheartedly embrace all of the Hundred throughout, including on its social media channels. That – along with the loud kits, the summer holiday scheduling and the shortened, metric format – gives the lie to what this is really all about. For all the disapproval of cricket’s current stakeholders, if the Hundred makes more children like cricket then it will be job done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9deead3a59e89c0f982b5eb81f186a832d3bb80/0_113_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e33286b2f488dde68dffbf5d092fb471","title":"ireland russia rugby world cup match report","story":"It feels like there are two different Ireland sides in this World Cup, one with Johnny Sexton, which thumped Scotland, and the one without, which lost against Japan.Against Russia, we saw both. Sexton played the first 40 minutes and Ireland led 21-0 at half-time, then Joe Schmidt wrapped him in tissue paper and popped him back in his box to keep him safe for the next game. Jack Carty came on and Ireland laboured horribly against a side who spent 13 of the next 20 minutes playing with 14 men because they had two players sent to the sin-bin. Right now, Sexton is holding this campaign together.Ireland won 35-0, which sounds better than it looked. Not least because they suffered a number of injuries along the way. Joey Carbery pulled out just before the match because he had aggravated an old ankle injury and Rob Kearney had to go off in the second half because he was “a little tight in the groin”.Schmidt reckons they will both be fit to play their final group match a week on Saturday. He will be more worried about Jordi Murphy, who has just joined the squad as a replacement for Jack Conan, but had to go off after half an hour. Murphy, Schmidt said, “may have popped a rib”.Sexton was captaining Ireland for the first time, which is a sign of how much they have come to rely on him. He made two tries, one by orchestrating a dummy loop move, which he then set up with an inside pass to Kearney, and the other by kicking a grubber for Peter O’Mahony.He nearly made three more, one with a kick that whistled across field to Keith Earls, who spilled the catch in a clash, another with a flat throw to Andrew Conway rushing up the wing (the referee called that one back because of a forward pass) and a third when he charged down a clearance.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterOtherwise, Ireland made a lot of mistakes, more slips, blips, misses, and fumbles than they would get away with against a better side. At one point Russia almost scored when Kearney, Conway and Garry Ringrose let the ball bounce between the three of them in their own 22. But it was the handling errors that really cost them. There were a couple of horrid knock-ons as they were closing on the try-line.It was the 62nd minute before they got their bonus point, when Earls put Conway through after catching Carty’s chip. Garry Ringrose added a fifth in the final minutes, after a crisp bit of work by Earls and Jordan Larmour.Schmidt blamed it on the humidity. “Speaking to guys who played here the last two times, the longer game goes on the more moisture there is on ball,” he said. “I’m pretty realistic about how tough conditions were.”England and Scotland had struggled at this stadium too, he said. But in truth the conditions Ireland played in weren’t nearly as severe as they had been during those matches. There was a storm right before the game, and the temperature fell with the rain. It was as cool and dry as it’s been in Kobe yet. “I’ve heard it cools off in October,” Schmidt said, “so I’m hopeful we’ll adjust.”But really, he needs his team to warm up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24743531a1d6b61a170fcf3c033402c45296b2cc/220_50_3756_2254/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb3a328d422fe4b69579243d0f887da8","title":"microsoft launches surface pro x and previews folding phone","story":"Product bonanza includes bigger Surface Laptop 3, Surface Earbuds and updated Surface Pro 7Microsoft has launched the Surface Pro X, a redesigned thin and light two-in-one Windows 10 PC running on custom ARM chips rather than traditional Intel processors, plus the Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3, and previewed a folding phone and dual-screen tablet.The products were unveiled at an event in New York on Wednesday, where Microsoft sought to grab attention from rivals including Apple and Samsung.The Surface Pro X is Microsoft’s next-generation mobile tablet-laptop hybrid. It fits a larger high-resolution 13in screen into the 12in frame of the existing Surface Pro, is only 5.3mm thick at its thinnest point and weighs 762g. It retains the detachable Type Cover keyboard from Microsoft’s existing line, but introduces a new Surface Slim Pen stylus that fits between keyboard and tablet for charging and storage.The biggest change is the use of the Microsoft SQ1 chip instead of Intel chips. The new custom ARM-based processor has an integrated AI engine and was developed with Qualcomm based on mobile device technology but running full Windows 10. Microsoft said the chip is three times more powerful per watt than the processor in the existing Surface Pro 6.“What does that mean? Better battery life, faster, thinner, lighter with unprecedented performance, all while running the full power of Windows, Office, Edge and Chrome,” said Panos Panay, the chief product officer of Microsoft.The new tablet PC also has always-connected 4G, similar to a smartphone, and promises battery life far in excess of traditional Intel computers.The Surface Pro X will start at £999 in the UK and $999 in the US, where it will ship in early November.The Surface Pro 7 will cost from $749 in the US and will ship on 22 October. It will cost £799 in the UK.Microsoft also unveiled updated traditional laptops with a refreshed 13.5in and brand new 15in Surface Laptop 3.The larger 15in Surface Laptop 3 bucks the trend with options for an Ryzen Surface Edition processor made by Intel’s longtime rival AMD, which Microsoft said has the fastest graphics of any laptop in its class.Geoff Blaber of analysts CCS Insight said: “Broadening its silicon partners to include AMD and Qualcomm will inevitably raise eyebrows and cause Intel to look over its shoulder.“The reality is that this is about choice, control and flexibility as Microsoft widens the Surface portfolio to address a growing range of devices and use cases.”Both laptops feature all-day battery life and Microsoft’s new fast-charging technology. They are also repairable, with removable hard drives and other components designed to be easily taken apart.In a clear dig at rival Apple, which has had problems with its laptop keyboards that are difficult to repair, Panay said: “Being able to repair and service a product without impacting the beauty and elegance is critical. Serviceability, repairability, we did things so we can replace the screen or the keyboard without affecting the beauty.”The 13in Surface Laptop 3 costs from $999 and the 15in version costs $1,199 in the US, shipping on 22 October. In the UK it will cost £999 and £1,199.Microsoft also announced a new set of true wireless earbuds, called the Surface Earbuds, which are direct competitors to Apple’s AirPods and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds and join its existing Surface Headphones.The Bluetooth earbuds feature one-clip pairing, multi-device compatibility – meaning they can be used with PCs, phones and tablets from all brands – and have up to 24-hour battery life with a charging case. A dual-mic array in each ear is designed to pick up the user’s voice and cancel the background noise, which was demoed though voice dictation in Office for real-time captions and translation.They also have direct Spotify integration for starting playback without having to reach for the phone on Android, and gesture controls for playback and volume – something missing on many wireless earbuds.The Surface Earbuds will cost $249 later this year in the US.Alongside products due to go on sale this year, Microsoft also took the wraps off two products it is working on for Christmas 2020.The Surface Duo is a two-screen folding phone, which has two 5.6in screens bolted together with a hinge that folds a full 360 degrees. The phone opens like a book then folds all the way round.Microsoft pitched the Surface Duo as having the benefits of a phone, but also a computer on which you can do more because it has two screens. However, with folding devices such as Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which have one continuous flexible screen that opens like a book instead of two screens bolted together, the Duo may be out of date before it ships.Panay said the firm had partnered with Google to bring Android apps and the Play Store to the Duo, “bringing the absolute best of Microsoft with the absolute best of Google”.“You’re more productive on two screens, much more than one screen can ever be, but it has to be elegant, it has to be robust,” he said, in a vague reference to Samsung’s Galaxy Fold, which has had problems with the robustness of its flexible screen.Microsoft also unveiled the Surface Neo, which it said would be the evolution of its Surface computer line. It too has dual screens, with a hinge in the middle, but will run a new version of Microsoft’s operating system called Windows 10X.The firm said the new device will have a detachable keyboard and can be opened like a book, used as two screens or one, used like a laptop with a virtual trackpad on one screen, or folded all the way over. It also supports the Surface Thin Pen, which attaches to the back of the device, and uses a new Intel chip designed to support dual-screen devices. The Surface Neo will be 5.6mm thick and weigh 655g.“I believe this is the next category to adapt to you in form and function, creating unlimited and interrupted flow,” said Panay.However, neither the Surface Duo or Neo will be available until Christmas 2020. More than a year is a long time in technology.Blaber said: “Surface Duo is a bold new category of device and will take time to build developer and carrier support.“The launch of Surface Duo will inevitably draw comparison with its doomed Windows Phone investments. Duo is not without risk, but Microsoft isn’t trying to repeat history and reinvent the wheel. It’s using an established platform to deliver a new category that is optimised for a Microsoft experience.“This is the start of a journey for Microsoft and expectations should be set accordingly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44b96b1dd0276d82357f664cfc7a78ee8bd0498b/0_68_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e696306303e9537391ead1e70d48b27","title":"facebook faces tougher controls after eu ruling","story":"ECJ says member states can order platform to remove defamatory material globallyFacebook will be subject to tougher controls over online content after the EU’s highest court ruled the social media company can be ordered by member states to remove defamatory material worldwide.The judgment from the European court of justice in Luxembourg was condemned by free speech organisations for imposing restrictions on online comments. It effectively edges internet service providers further down the road towards becoming traditional publishers.The decision followed a complaint by the Austrian Green politician Eva Glawischnig-Piesczek to Facebook Ireland – the company’s European headquarters – seeking the removal of comments posted by a user.The ECJ, judgments of which remain binding on the UK, said social media sites can be ordered to take down unlawful material.Host providers such as Facebook are currently not liable for stored information if they have no knowledge of its illegal nature or if they act “expeditiously” to remove or disable access to that information as soon as they become aware of it.The latest ruling, however, states exemption does not prevent online platforms from being ordered by national authorities to remove illegal information or disable access to it.Free speech organisations warned the decision represented a threat to online content. The executive director of the charity Article 19, Thomas Hughes, said: “This judgment has major implications for online freedom of expression around the world.“Compelling social media platforms like Facebook to automatically remove posts regardless of their context will infringe our right to free speech and restrict the information we see online. The judgment does not take into account the limitations of technology when it comes to automated filters.“The ruling also means that a court in one EU member state will be able to order the removal of social media posts in other countries, even if they are not considered unlawful there. This would set a dangerous precedent where the courts of one country can control what internet users in another country can see. This could be open to abuse, particularly by regimes with weak human rights records.”The judgment enables a court in one EU member state to issue an order that could be used to remove posts by users around the world, even though what is considered unlawful in one country might not be considered unlawful in a different jurisdiction.The decision also raises questions about how material found to be unlawful in one country will be identified by Facebook or other social media sites without searching through the posts of all its users.Ted Shapiro, a solicitor at London media law firm Wiggin, said: “The court recognised that simply requiring a platform to take down a specific piece of defamatory content and content identical to that would be too easy to circumvent … It held that platforms can also be ordered to take down equivalent content, if specified in a court order. “This, the court said, does not constitute an excessive burden on the platform, particularly where it has recourse to automated search tools and technologies.... This provides more clarity for platforms as to what they must do to comply with their obligations under the law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d67f364f92827e5c4d1559471e09da24fe5897a1/1_0_1689_1014/master/1689.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6da66cad5f76da32e743dcd1eef3b689","title":"can a mini pc and a tv set replace a old laptop","story":"Anthony wants to replace his mother’s old Windows 7 laptop. Would a mini-PC hooked up to her 32in TV work well enough? My retired mother happily uses her iPhone and iPad for the majority of her digital needs, but she uses an old, low-spec Windows 7 laptop for Microsoft Office documents for various committees she sits on, for her music library and digital photos, some web browsing and other tasks that cannot be easily done on a small device.I have a Mac Mini running through a 42in TV set, and we are interested in the feasibility of using a mini PC hooked up to her 32in TV. Target budget is £300 for PC, keyboard and any adaptors.For the OS evangelists among your readers, I use a Mac and I may well repurpose her laptop with Linux, but Mum wants Windows. AntMini or micro PCs are terrific at what they do, as long as you don’t expect them to do too much. They are also potential space-savers because they can be attached to the back of any monitor or TV set that has a standard VESA mount. Anyone unfamiliar with the form factor can read an answer from November 2018, What is the point of mini PCs?However, mini PCs come in at least three overlapping categories. First, there are entry-level models that cost about £100 to £350, and are essentially television set-top boxes. Second, there are desktop replacement minis that are widely used in large businesses for their convenience and space-saving properties. Prices range from £300 to about £1,500.The third category consists of so-called barebones machines that appeal to computer enthusiasts and other people who want to build their own small-format systems. These could be set-top boxes or desktop replacements depending on the parts used. However, they don’t appeal to home users who want an off-the-shelf set-top box for media streaming, and they don’t appeal to businesses, which buy standardised mini PCs in volume from HP, Lenovo and Dell.Your question is about the feasibility of using a (roughly) £250 mini PC hooked up to a 32in TV for Microsoft Office and some other uses, such as managing music and photo libraries. There are a couple of reasons why I don’t think it’s a good idea.The main problem is that it’s not practical to use programs such as Word and Excel at typical TV viewing distances, especially not with such a small TV set. In the old days, interface designers distinguished between “the 3ft experience” of using a computer monitor and “the 10ft experience” of using a TV set. They needed radically different approaches, and different-sized icons and text.Even if we assume the TV set can display small text sharply enough, your mum will need to be around 3ft1 metre from the screen to make it usable. Based on my long experience of watching TV in normal-sized living rooms, I’ll be surprised if this is practical. However, you can easily check this by plugging mum’s current Windows laptop into her TV set.The other problem is your budget. There are plenty of very cheap mini PCs, but their specifications generally include an old and slow Intel Atom processor, 2GB or 4GB of memory, and 32GB of eMMC chip storage, which is pretty much on a par with an SD card. Amazingly enough, machines like this will run Microsoft Office with home-sized documents, but they are underpowered for what your mother needs.Worse, any PC with limited storage – 32GB or 64GB – may run into problems updating Windows 10 twice a year, even though it should be able to handle upgrades by using, say, an external hard drive as temporary storage space. (Presumably your mum already has one for backup purposes. If not, install some kind of backup solution as soon as possible.)Suppliers rarely sell their higher-spec PCs for less than their lower-spec versions, so either I’m missing something or the apparent anomalies won’t last very long.If you buy a mini PC for closer to £200 then you could still come in around your budget price with either of these monitors, as long as your mother can find space for the extra screen.Under the circumstances, you may want to take the easy way out and replace mum’s old laptop with a new laptop. It’s some time since I looked at cheap laptops, and my most recent answer covered laptops costing up to £500. You can still buy “real” laptops for less, but below £300, the experience gets progressively worse.Yes, you can live with a laptop that has limited screen resolution (1366 x 768 pixels), a slow Intel Pentium or Celeron processor, only 4GB of memory and a traditional hard drive, but you can do dramatically better for not a lot more money.Low specs are a false economy. Today, 8GB of RAM costs about £30, so fitting 4GB instead of 8GB only saves $20 at retail prices. It must save even less at the wholesale prices that HP and Lenovo pay when they are buying more than 1m memory modules a week. At current prices, it’s crazy to buy PCs with only 4GB, unless you plan to add more memory instantly.Have you got a question?

Ben Chanan’s surveillance thriller isn’t just one of the most cleverly plotted dramas of recent years – it’s also one of the most satisfying.In part, that satisfaction comes from the many ways the show uses technology to keep the audience off balance. From the moment it became clear that while DI Rachel Carey (Holliday Grainger) was convinced her detectives were outside the house Shaun Emery (Callum Turner) was being interrogated in he clearly couldn’t be, to the jaw-dropping explanation by an image manipulation expert of just how that scene could be faked, The Capture has created outlandish scenarios that are also strangely plausible.The UK is the most spied on country in the world, our images constantly caught on CCTV, body cameras and drones and even controversially used by private companies. From there, it’s a small step to The Capture – a world in which security forces don’t simply spy on citizens but manipulate images to ensure that “justice” is served.And while the show’s shadowy organisation, The Correction, might be a classic thriller trope (it was the governments what done it), it remains just this side of believable. The nifty tricks deployed by said organisation – the splicing of footage, the manipulation of CCTV – feel darkly credible. It may not have happened yet, but you wouldn’t be at all surprised if it did.Adding to that sense of plausibility is a refusal to cheat the audience by providing easy explanations. Chanan’s script doesn’t withhold crucial information to deliver cheap gotcha moments later instead, we discover things as Carey and Emery do – a fact never more obvious than with this week’s penultimate episode.Thus we learned how the injustice at the heart of the story came about: that barrister Hannah (Laura Haddock) had her own agenda all along. That she and her colleague Charlie (Barry Ward) never had Shaun’s interests at heart. In fact, it was another case entirely that held their attention. The case, as it happened, that made Carey’s name: a possible miscarriage of justice involving four young Muslim men, now jailed for terrorism offences, which they hoped to bring into the spotlight using Emery as collateral.And if Emery was simply a pawn, who really cared? He was only a soldier, after all, and one who may well be guilty of the crime they fought so hard to exonerate him for.As treachery has piled upon treachery and Emery came to realise just how much he had been used, we were treated not only to an immensely rewarding experience but also a refreshingly grownup hour of television. And, in an era defined by endless cliffhanging twists and turns, there is something fascinating about a show that refuses to spoon-feed its audience.It helps, too, that the acting is so strong. As Carey, Grainger expertly walks the line between ruthless and concerned (it’s a pleasure, too, to see a female character so unapologetic about her ambition). But the show really belongs to Turner, whose Emery is a plausible mix of vulnerable and dangerous – a man who has undoubtedly been set up, yet whose capacity for violence always simmers just under the surface.The real reason The Capture strikes such a nerve, though, is that it references not the whizz-bang edge-of-your-seat thrillers of the current era but darker, more complicated stories of the 1970s.Deeply paranoid films (Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, The Conversation, The Manchurian Candidate) hit a nerve in febrile times. Similarly, the creeping paranoia of The Capture – the sense that we could and should trust nothing, not even the evidence we see in front of us – feels like the perfect fit for the increasingly untrustworthy age in which we are living.As it moves towards the climax, it is genuinely unclear how events will play out. Will Carey manage to save Emery? What is the truth about the original war crime for which he was convicted? Will The Correction be exposed?In a lesser show, the temptation would be to go for the happy ending, making the bad guys pay and allowing Carey to have her moment of glory. But everything about The Capture so far suggests that it is a very different kind of thriller, one that knows the easy ending is not always the right one.Here’s hoping, then, that Chanan holds his nerve and delivers not a pat wrapping up of loose ends but something more nuanced and complex, as befits the most adult and interesting thriller on TV this year.

It allows the government to “make any regulations” it considers in the public interest, if it decides the city faces “an occasion of emergency or public danger”.Measures imposed could include censorship, control or suppression of the media, arrests, detentions, deportations, and seizure of property. The legislature can only amend or repeal any law passed under the emergency regulations once it has already been implemented.The regulations are considered so extreme that they have not been used for over half a century, and never deployed since the 1997 handover to Chinese sovereignty.“The emergency regulations are the start of a slip towards an authoritarian state,” lawmaker Dennis Kwok said at a news conference, adding that he did not expect any form of government crackdown to end the protest movement.“The yearning for freedom democracy and liberty are not going to go away just because you bring in more draconian regulations,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1c2204dd6df26a106b43ab91b19a523aba91f3a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6b000852294a3a46ba57b2e4b628ed0","title":"ok sign gesture emoji rightwing alt right","story":"The media has been manipulated by extremists but focusing on the victims offers journalists a way to redress the balanceAnother day, another seemingly harmless symbol you can’t use without appearing to be a purveyor of hate.The alt-right’s latest trophy is the OK hand sign, which was officially recognised as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League over the weekend. And on Tuesday, it was reported that a Universal Orlando Resort employee was fired after concerned parents found a photo of him making the hand sign on their six-year-old’s shoulder (their child is biracial and has autism).The OK sign joins a number of surprising symbols co-opted by the alt-right, such as the milk emoji, Pepe the frog and even, at one point, Taylor Swift.She explains how these media manipulators see an opportunity – for example, when something goes viral or becomes popular – and choose it as a moment to insert themselves into the conversation. In the case of the Facebook “Trash Doves” sticker, for example, 4chan users noticed the cartoon go viral and sent out the rallying cry: “Let’s make this normie meme a Nazi symbol!”With this process, they flex their muscles, showing that what the Lord giveth, the alt-right can take away. And it’s done through elaborate means, too: with Trash Doves, 4chan-users began to photoshop swastikas on to the viral Facebook cartoon. Sometimes they’re even more sophisticated, creating fake content cards like that of the ADL’s. They circulate the content online through social media, leaving it out as bait for undiscerning journalists who perpetuate the hoax by writing about it as if it is an authentic hate-threat.“This is their trick: they are hoping journalists will uncritically look at the OK symbol, find these infographics that claim it stands for white power and then write about it. The trolls have a laugh when the journalists are fooled,” says Donovan.“These become symbols of hate pretty much exclusively because of journalistic coverage,” says Wendy Phillips, who wrote This is Why We Can’t Have Nice things: Mapping the Relationship between Online Trolling and Mainstream Culture.Ultimately, this a game about power: if rightwing trolls can make the so-called liberal media look gullible, then it has a delegitimising effect, supporting the idea that journalists are oversensitive, easily triggered snowflakes. Soon enough, the news begins to feels like it belongs to a parody website rather than real life.“What memes do is they create in-groups and out-groups. The in-groups know it’s satirical, the out-groups think it’s something to fear,” says Donovan. ﻿Part of the effect is to make you think that white supremacists could be everywhere, hiding in plain sight. If someone as important as the president could be one of them – Trump likes to flash the gesture when he speaks – who else is? Heck, maybe you’re a white supremacist, because the last time you sent an OK emoji you were unwittingly signalling your belief in the superiority of the white race.At some point, life begins to imitate their art, and what began as a media hoax takes on dangerously radical connotations. This point came when the Australian man charged with killing 51 people at mosques in New Zealand, made the OK gesture during a courtroom appearance after being arrested.Phillips says even if stories written about these memes are incredulous or mocking, they might help the cause, since media attention is what those groups are after.“Many of us tend to be very fascinated in the bad guys themselves which is understandable but they are the smallest part of the story,” she says.So what does this mean for journalists? Phillips argues that media organisations can’t ever truly separate themselves from the amplification of white nationalists if they have to report on them.Instead, she advocates for the media to shift the camera away from the white supremacists and focus on its real victims. That means looking at its impact on minority communities in places like Texas, and on the people who live in the small towns that neo-Nazis turn up in. It means highlighting the toxic resentment of women that the patriarchal ideology of white nationalism results in, and what it feels like for a mother to have white supremacists take her daughter away.Ultimately, it means reporting the news but in a different way, says Phillips: “I don’t think the media shouldn’t tell the truth, you should just tell a bigger truth: about the impact of these behaviours, instead of just reporting on the genesis of them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7321f070419a56a278ae1a8112e8ee45c0f7dca5/0_86_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd5b652f611fcc236d49ec657ccfa4b","title":"us leads arms sales to saudis followed by uk from 2014 2018","story":"In spite of repeated incidents of mass casualties, both countries have sought to press ahead with sales of their weaponry Selling arms to Saudi Arabia has been a hard drug for western governments to give up.There has been no shortage of evidence that western-supplied weaponry has been used to inflict mass civilian casualties.In a study of 27 attacks involving the deaths of Yemeni civilians published by Stanford Law School in March, 25 involved the use of a US weapon while UK weapons were used in five cases.The weapon dropped on a school bus killing 40 children in August 2018 was a US-made precision-guided Paveway bomb.In spite of repeated incidents of mass casualties, both countries have sought to press ahead with sales of their most sophisticated and expensive weaponry, while France has been trying to regain a market share.In June, the UK court of appeal ruled such sales unlawful, saying government ministers, including the current prime minister, Boris Johnson, had signed off on arms exports to Saudi without properly assessing the risk to civilians.Since then, the UK undertook to grant no further arms export licenses for Saudi sales, but had to apologise earlier this month for two breaches it said were “inadvertent”.In April this year, Congress made a bid to limit US involvement in the Yemen war. The gruesome murder by Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 deepened the congressional unease over the civilian death toll, which showed no signs of abating, despite administration promises that constant improvements in targeting were being made with US help.In April, a bipartisan bill was agreed by the House of Representatives and Senate to end US participation in the Yemen war, marking the first time Congress had invoked the 1973 War Powers Resolution to send a bill to the White House, calling on the president to take the US out of conflict.

Photograph: iStockOne in seven older Irish adults is not getting enough sleep, resulting in increased risk of health problems, according to new research.A similar proportion are sleeping longer than is recommended, which can also lead to negative health outcomes, the study by Trinity College Dublin researchers found.The duration of sleep increases with age, with adults aged 50 years and older sleeping for an average of seven hours and 42 minutes a night.The recommended sleep range is seven to nine hours for adults aged 26 to 64 years, and seven to eight hours for those aged 65 years and older. Previous research has shown that sleeping too little, and too much, are risk factors for premature mortality, cardiovascular and chronic disease, and impairments in cognitive and mental health.Using devices fitted on their wrists, the 1,533 participants reported their own sleep durations over a one-week period.The researchers found 70 per cent slept within the recommenced range, 14 per cent got less sleep than recommended and 17 per cent got more than recommended.Sleep duration recordings taken during summer months were shorter than those taken in autumn and winter. Retired and unemployed adults, and those on anti-depressant medication, recorded longer sleep periods.Poor health was more likely to be associated with shorter sleep compared with good health, while moderate or high physical activity was associated with normal sleep.Lead author Siobhan Scarlett said the research showed an important subset of Irish adults were not meeting recommended guidelines for sleep duration and so were at increased risk of negative health outcomes. Many sleep factors affecting sleep duration can be modified, she pointed out. “Addressing the underlying causes of undesirable sleep patterns may help to facilitate improvements in the health and wellbeing of our older population.” The study, which is part of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (Tilda), are published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4039352.1570123056!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germans increasingly divided over unification legacy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA model of the Brandenburg Gate  in Kiel, northern Germany,  where  about 500,000 visitors are expected to  celebrate German Unification Day.  Photograph: Focke StrangmannEPAGermans are ided like never before over the legacy of their country’s unification as they marked nearly three decades as one country on Thursday.Ahead of next month’s anniversary of the night 30 years ago when the Berlin Wall was breached by crowds of east Germans, marking the end of the territory’s failed Soviet-imposed socialism experiment, a new survey shows a majority of easterners are also unhappy with their experience of German democracy.On Thursday chancellor Angela Merkel, raised in the vanished German Democratic Republic (GDR), admitted that much remained to be done on the road to uniting the country.“German unification at state level is completed, the unity of the Germans . . . was not completed on October 3rd, 1990, nor is it to this day,” she said.She urged western Germans to reflect on the setbacks many easterners experienced after 19891990, above all unemployment, when “after the burden of ision, the full force of unification followed”.The official unification ceremony in the northern port city of Kiel opened with Leonard Bernstein’s sparky overture to the musical Candide.\u0026nbspThe musical choice, a nod to the local musical festival founded by Bernstein in 1987, brought unintended irony to proceedings.\u0026nbspHis musical is based on Voltaire’s satire of 18th century Westphalia as the best of all possible worlds political speakers on Thursday lined up to insist that this is the best of all possible Germanies.Ceremony host Daniel Günther, state premier of Schleswig-Holstein, praised the courage of eastern Germans for going onto the streets against the regime.“We want to remember the courage of 1989 and also call people to be more courageous once more today,” he said.He urged people to ignore those who trade in panic and, without mentioning the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) by name, attacked its attempts to hijack the legacy of 1989 as a “mockery” of easterners’ achievements.National surveys ahead of next month’s Berlin Wall anniversary paint a mixed picture of German unification.Some 71 per cent of easterners and two-thirds of westerners say the hopes they linked to unification have been fulfilled, according to a survey carried out for Der Spiegel magazine.Gloomier pictureA gloomier picture is visible in a survey for Die Zeit weekly, with just 52 per cent of easterners satisfied with how democracy is practised in the united Germany. Some 70 per cent believe decisions are made over easterners’ heads, with analyst Richard Hillmer pointing to Dr Merkel’s 2015 decision not to close the border to refugees.“Doing this without any limitation . . . debate or vote in the Bundestag is viewed by many people as an arbitrary state action,” he said.Some 59 per cent of easterners quizzed by Die Zeit think freedom of speech is just as limited – or even more limited – in today’s Germany compared to the GDR, while 70 per cent feel less protected against criminality.The Zeit survey revealed the deep-rooted hurt of easterners, with 80 per cent convinced western Germans have never understood – let alone acknowledged – the dramatic adaptation required to survive after 1989.Also visible in the Zeit survey are continued differences in political perspective left by four decades within Russia’s sphere of influence. Nearly half (48 per cent) believe coverage of Russia in Germany is too negative while 80 per cent believe relations with Moscow and Washington are equally important. That compares to 9 and 11 per cent who favour closer ties to the US and Russia respectively.The far-right, by monopolising these themes and wounds, took 28 per cent in the eastern state of Saxony last month – a success it hopes to repeat on October 27th in the state of Thuringia."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4039130.1570123323!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tusk fully behind ireland as meps reject uk brexit proposals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t European Council president  Donald Tusk: the EU remains “open but still unconvinced” by the UK plans. Photograph: Peter FoleyEPAEuropean Council president Donald Tusk has said the EU stands “fully behind Ireland” after the UK published its new Brexit proposals, adding in a tweet that the union remains “open but still unconvinced” by the UK plans.Separately, MEPs warned that there is not nearly enough in the UK proposals for a deal they could endorse. The cross-party European Parliament Brexit Steering Group (BSG) said in a detailed response to the proposals that they do not “even remotely” amount to an acceptable deal.\u0026nbsp“Safeguarding peace and stability on the island of\u0026nbspIreland, protection of citizens and EU’s legal order has to be the main focus of any deal,” it said in a statement. “The UK proposals do not match even remotely what was agreed as a sufficient compromise in the backstop.”The MEPs, who will be asked to vote on any deal before it can be approved, pointed to two key elements of the British proposals as particularly problematic – the so-called Stormont lock, and the insistence by the UK that the North would leave the EU customs union and the consequent necessity for customs controls.“The right of consent being offered to the Northern Irish assembly effectively makes an agreement contingent, uncertain, provisional, unilateral, instead of the safety net provided for by the backstop,” the BSG statement said.“Furthermore, the Northern Irish assembly has not sat for nearly three years, and it is questionable whether it would be able to reconvene and take on the responsibility for an international treaty of this nature.”‘Red lines’The plan for customs checks and controls on the island of Ireland would “breach a range of fundamental principles and red lines,” it said.“The UK proposals on customs and on regulatory aspects explicitly provide for infrastructure, controls and checks but are unclear as to exactly where and how these would be carried out,” the committee said.“Any form of controls and checks in and around the border would signify the end of frictionless trade and as such would harm the all-island economy as well as represent a serious risk to the peace process, and could imply a serious risk for our consumers and businesses.”British sources said, however, that their proposals explicitly rule out regulatory checks on the island of Ireland by preserving regulatory alignment on the whole island. And they insist that customs checks would be far from the Border.The MEPs warn that “At the same time, such controls would not be sufficient to guarantee the protection of EU consumers and businesses in all circumstances, thereby potentially leaving the EU with a significant hole in its single market.”The UK’s suggestion of working out the details of how technology could be used to help with that during the Brexit transition period, the MEPs said, was unacceptable.Technical talksIn Brussels, Boris Johnson’s “sherpa” David Frost was continuing technical discussions with the European Commission’s Brexit task force. The talks are expected to continue on Friday.The commission was not adding to the cautious welcome president Jean-Claude Juncker gave to the new proposals on Wednesday, when he suggested they were still “problematic”. Those elements \u0026nbspof\u0026nbspMr \u0026nbspJohnson’s plan need to be fixed by the UK rather than the EU, a spokeswoman said on Thursday.Brussels would not be left “holding the bag”, the spokeswoman said. “We would remind you that it’s the UK leaving the European Union and not the EU leaving the UK.”She added: “We are doing everything in our power to ensure that exit is on an orderly basis and we are willing to engage constructively with our counterparts. But we are not going to be the ones left holding the bag, the ball, or any other kind of object.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: PAScotland has become the first country in the UK to ban outright the physical punishment of children, making it a criminal offence for parents to smack their offspring.The member’s bill, which was lodged by the Scottish Green party MSP John Finnie and supported by the Scottish National party government, was passed overwhelmingly on Thursday evening, with 84 MSPs voting in favour and 29 against. It is designed to give children equal protection from violence by removing the defence of “justifiable assault” in Scots law.In Ireland, the legislation which allowed parents to use force against their children was repealed almost 17 years ago, and a complete ban on smacking was introduced in 2015.Parents in England and Northern Ireland are currently allowed to use “reasonable chastisement”, while the Welsh government is considering similar legislation to Scotland.Leading the final stage debate, Mr Finnie, a former police officer, said there was an urgent need to bring Scotland into line with best practice across the world, with 57 other countries already prohibiting the physical punishment of children.“Critics of this simple reform often say that it criminalises parents, but there is no evidence that this change to the law leads to increased prosecutions in any of the more than 50 countries where this change has taken place,” he said.MSPs also rejected two amendments which the Scottish Conservatives claimed would clarify the bill, in particular around instances such as preventing a child running into a busy road or pulling a pan of boiling water on to themselves.Children’s campaigners welcomed the move as evidence of a wholesale shift in attitudes to child rearing and children’s rights over the past few decades. Mary Glasgow, chief executive of Children 1st, Scotland’s national children’s charity, condemned what she described as “scaremongering” during the debating of the bill.“Listening to the evidence from police, social workers and others working directly with families, it has been clear that there is no intent to criminalise parents, but to bring the law in line with the international evidence and modern parenting practice,” she said. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4038253.1570055301!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us to target key irish food and drink brands with 25 tariff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe tariffs on butter will likely hit Kerrygold, which is the second-most popular butter brand in the United States.

File photograph: Getty Irish food and beverage products including Kerrygold and Baileys are to be hit by a new 25 per cent tariff by the United States.The Trump administration unveiled plans to tax EU imports following a WTO ruling on Wednesday.In a blow to Irish and European food exporters, the Office of the US Trade Representative announced it would impose tariffs of 25 per cent on a range of food products including butter, cheese, pork and several drink products, including liqueurs such as Baileys.However, while whiskey from Scotland and Northern Ireland – including Bushmills – will be hit, it appears that Irish whiskey has been exempted from the tariffs.The decision was announced hours after the United States was given the green light to impose $7.5 billion (€6.84 billion) worth of tariffs on European exports.The Geneva-based WTO issued its judgment in the long-running trade dispute, ruling that the United States could impose trade measures worth up to $7.5 billion over what it has said are unfair subsidies given to Airbus.It marks the largest ever ruling by the international trade body.Ireland’s butter and liqueur exporters will be among the businesses affected by the ruling, with the new tariffs due to come into effect on October 18th.Apparent exemptionHowever, the apparent exemption for whiskey from the Republic of Ireland will be welcomed, given that the US is Ireland’s primary export market for whiskey.The tariffs on butter will likely hit Kerrygold, which is the second-most popular butter brand in the United States. More than 34,000 tonnes of the Irish product was exported there in 2018.An analysis by Ibec earlier this year found that Irish goods would be the most exposed, on a per capita basis, to the proposed US tariffs on EU goods, noting that €818 million worth of products would be hit. “Given that the food and drink sector makes up two-thirds of the exports of indigenous firms, there is potential here for significant knock-on impacts on the domestic economy,” the association writes in its most recent economic outlook.‘Big win’Speaking at a press conference in the White House on Wednesday, President Donald Trump said that the WTO ruling was a “big win for the United States”.“The WTO has been much better to us since I’ve been president because they understand they can’t get away with what they’ve been getting away with for so many years, which is ripping off the United States,” he said of the decades-long dispute.The WTO is due to rule on a parallel case brought by the EU against US support for Boeing early next year.

Of course, it was all part of the Ziggy theatrics, a show that began with DavidZiggy walking out to the drums of “Five Years” and continued with mime, flamboyance and songs that have all become classics. I remember his appearance being heralded by music from Beethoven’s Ninth (also used in A Clockwork Orange, the film being current at the time). In those years Bowie always used it as his theme music. I also remember being blown away by the support act – a fresh, imaginative outfit called Roxy Music. (David Lister)Truly charismatic performers leave an indelible impression and I marvelled at the way Chuck Berry had the crowd in the palm of his hand when I saw him in the 1970s. But few could match Dolly Parton in her prime for her larger-than-life enthusiasm and sheer sense of fun. When the country superstar came to London’s Dominion Theatre in 1983, she played some mean finger-picking banjo, sang beautifully, especially on an a capella version of “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?” and even did an Elvis impression. Her concert was filmed for a video release and about half an hour after the crowd had left in, they brought in a large group of young punks and Goths (to intercut into crowd shots) and suggest an edgy young following. Happily, I had stayed around and saw her deliver this impromptu extra set, which was full of risqué jokes and blue banter. There’s no one quite like her. (Martin Chilton)You don’t usually realise you’re present at what will become a moment in history. But that sunny July afternoon at Wembley Stadium felt special right from the off, even if the off was Status Quo doing “Rockin’ All Over The World”. There were numerous stand-out moments perhaps on paper the biggest was the return of Paul McCartney, topping the bill after nearly five years self-enforced absence from high-profile performing following the shooting of John Lennon. Somewhat sadly the sound failed for part of “Let It Be”, but we can draw a veil over that. The most stunning set of the day came from Queen: a high energy medley through “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Radio Ga Ga” to “We Will Rock You” and “We Are The Champions”. No one fired up the crowd quite as much that day. And since the band had not been at their most visible around that time, this proved to be their resurrection. (David Lister)Blues titan BB King released two of the greatest concert albums of the 20th-century in Live at the Regal (1964) and Live in Cook County Jail (1971). Even though he was 60 when I saw him at London’s Hammersmith Odeon in 1985, he was still full of energy. He sang with passion and his guitar work was transcendent, especially on gloriously funky version of “The Thrill is Gone”. I skipped my graduation ceremony for the concert and had the good fortune to bump into an old family friend called Ray Bolden, who had worked at Dobell\u0027s Record Shop in Charing Cross Road. King\u0027s face lit up to see Ray, who had put him up in his London flat in the 1950s. The blues superstar could not have been friendlier, despite his tiredness after a long gig. Seeing Muddy Waters live in 1979 was special but BB King at full power, bending guitar notes like no one else, topped even that. (Martin Chilton)When The Jesus \u0026amp Mary Chain reached the status of noisenik godheads with their fourth album Honey’s Dead in 1992, they decided to put together a visceral modern rock revue tour called Rollercoaster that’s still ringing in my ears almost 30 years on. Of the three revolving support acts, Blur opened the night, mid-transformation from baggy latecomers to art-pop pioneers. With Damon Albarn flinging himself wildly around the stage and clambering up amp stacks, they premiered ferocious second-album character studies like “Colin Zeal” while screening films of the journey of meat from slaughterhouse to defecation, in reverse. Most crucially, with their all-horns-blazing new single “Popscene”, they kick-started Britpop right before our eyes. The Mary Chain, meanwhile, were at peak malicious, I left with my skull buzzing, my eyes opened and my tastes re-arranged, convinced I\u0027d seen the new music, and I had. A gig that didn’t just make my night, it made me. (Mark Beaumont)When Pixies came onto a London stage on my birthday in 2004 and played Pixies songs – and music just doesn’t get better than that – it was pure relief, euphoria and dark-hearted epiphany. “Tame” sent me feral, “Gigantic” was titanic, “Bone Machine” crushed out my marrow. Black Francis snarled, barked and ranted through “Gouge Away”, “Monkey Gone To Heaven” and “Debaser”, every bit the demented pervert preacher he ever was Kim Deal’s angelic coos and bass melodies made an unholy pact with Joey Santiago’s werewolf guitar riffs, seemingly played with a plectrum made of Satan’s fingernail. Of their four Brixton dates that week, I lost every ounce of my s*** at three. Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)The long gone Rainbow in London’s Finsbury Park was one of the great rock venues, and though I was young at the time it would be impossible to forget the impact of Bowie in one of his first outings as Ziggy Stardust. “They haven’t even finished building the stage,” I said with breathtaking naievety to the person next to me, on observing the scaffolding and ladder.

Best gigs ever, no particular order.North London’s tiny and now-defunct, Buffalo Bar in the 2000s, hosted early gigs from the likes of Bloc Party, The Libertines, The Maccabees – or Foals. Their show took place 14 months before the release of their debut album Antidotes, and it justified their precocious reputation as a live act. That night, the energy of their high-octane math-rock was infectious it’s not often that you see a band in their earliest days and know that this is probably the last time you’ll be able to reach out and touch them. The songs followed: The French Open, Balloons, Hummer”, “Mathletics”, all fuelled by astoundingly complex polyrhythms, interweaving staccato synths and guitar played high on the fretboard in angular electro harmonies, set to punk-disco techno beats and urgent new wave vocals. I’d never seen a rock gig so precisely engineered (a sticker on the synth read Math is for Everyone), yet so exhilarating. There was a true sense we’d discovered something great. (Elisa Bray)Problematic in every way given singer Alice Glass’s October 2017 statement accusing her former bandmate Ethan Kath of sexual abuse, non-consensual sex and controlling behaviour, but this short set in front of a small crowd in a Camden bar was proof that when a performer truly plugs into the mother lode, the intensity they generate can burn itself into your retinas and shake your soul. Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as “Courtship Dating”. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of “rock ’n’ roll” – or whatever the hell it is – most of the time, they’re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There’s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it. (Chris Harvey)918 Nick Cave \u0026amp the Bad Seeds, Brighton Centre, 2008It used to be that rock’n’roll was a young person’s game anyone over the age of 50 still tearing it up on stage needed to calm down and have a word with themselves. Nick Cave, the latter-day harbinger of the apocalypse still identifiable by his raven hair and pallbearer’s suit, has consistently shown us the idiocy of this thinking. I’ve seen Cave perform scores of times and he has never let me down, but this show, which coincided with the release of the album Dig!!! Lazarus Dig!!!, was a whole new level of spectacular: funny, furious, life-affirming, heavy on the biblical melodrama. Alongside the Bad Seeds, then operating as a seven-piece coolly attired in suits, open-necked shirts and slicked-back hair, Cave showed how musical talent can deepen rather than ebb in mid-life, and how he was – and indeed remains – untouchable in terms of intellect, charisma and sheer feral energy. (Fiona Sturges)Leonard Cohen steps onto the stage, dressed in grey shirt and tie, black waistcoat, trilby concealing his white hair. It\u0027s sweltering. And yet Cohen, in his mid Seventies, is barely breaking into a sweat. Much like his attire, the songs - such as Dance Me to the End of Love and So Long, Marianne – are immaculate, his voice no longer a wail but a raw, rumbling baritone. The Spanish sun is beating down and my friends and I are genuflecting before one of the greatest lyricists of all time. This was to be the only time I saw him live and no performance has ever, in terms of pure emotional intensity, targeted me with such laser-guided precision as his rendition of Hallelujah. The song\u0027s been covered by everyone from Jeff Buckley to Alexandra Burke, but sung by him that day, it\u0027s surely never felt as moving. (Patrick Smith)The great Sixties and Seventies soul singers are nearly all gone now, and I doubt we’ll ever see their like again. Bobby Womack had recovered from colon cancer but was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease, and less than a year from his death in June 2014, when he played the UK in the summer of 2013. He came on stage on a sunny Saturday afternoon at the Latitude festival, to play songs from his brilliant comeback album, The Bravest Man in the Universe, to a basking, picnicking audience. “All soul singers come from gospel,” he told them. Womack’s voice still seemed like a gift from God. The years of cocaine addiction hadn’t altered its richness and warmth. To be in the presence of Womack that day, knowing it would likely be the last time, was very special.1218 St Vincent, End of the Road, 2014Most rockstars, terrified of seeming to be trying too hard, would never dream of hiring a choreographer. But St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, is no ordinary rockstar. For her Digital Witness tour, the musician recruited Annie B Carson to help her dream up a procession of strange, shuffling moves to perform alongside her brilliant self-titled fourth album. At End of the Road Festival – a small, Dorset delight which she had played with David Byrne a year earlier – her headline set was scuzzy, eccentric, and thrilling. At one point, without missing a lick on her guitar, she rolled herself down an oversized flight of white stairs like a glitching robot. Then again, no robot can play guitar like that. (Alexandra Pollard)After 35 years away from the stage it was a moment Kate Bush fans never thought would happen. Beforehand, I was reporting from outside the venue for NME and the excitement and energy was extraordinary, like nothing I\u0027ve ever experienced. One woman told me it would be fine if she died after the gig because she would die happy. The show started with a greatest hits section. And then it all got a bit more, well, Kate Bush, with a dramatic adaptation of The Ninth Wave. Sinking ships, confetti cannons, surreal fish people and a soliloquy about sausages. Act three was more pastoral. The second side of Aerial, The Sky of Honey, was performed in front of the most beautiful visuals I\u0027ve ever seen: birds, a red sun, a moon tilting on its axis and then Kate suspended into the air. Pure theatre. As we filed out, there was a sense that the audience was stunned. I still am. (Lucy Jones)Patti Smith was celebrating the 40th anniversary of her seminal 1975 album Horses at Field Day in Victoria Park, London, 2015. The sky was a perfect blue, and the sun was still blazing hot at 7pm. “I’m sorry about the dark glasses,” Smith said by way of introduction. “I’m not trying to be cool, it’s just, you know… the sun.” “You’re the f***ing coolest!” a fan screamed back. From there, she and her band, including long-serving guitarist Lenny Kaye, embarked on a blistering set that had myself, and many other audience members, in tears. Smith is a ferocious performer, she spat and snarled and howled tearing up her guitar as though it just insulted one of her favourite poets. It didn’t matter if she messed up, as she did on “Break it Up”, because she offered the instantly immortal words: “I don’t do nothing perfect. I only f*** up perfect.” You felt you were in the presence of something momentous. (Roisin O’Connor)When D’Angelo released his surprise third record – the politically fraught Black Messiah – it ended the 14-year hiatus that followed 2000’s Voodoo. It also reminded music fans that the American hip-hop artist was still as monumentally talented as he was back then. Accompanied by his eight-strong band The Vanguard, his show at the Hammersmith Apollo was a visceral, quasi-religious experience. Jesse Johnson, formerly of Prince-produced outfit The Time, added funky hooks to “Sugah Daddy”, while legendary bassist Pino Palladino took time out from The Who\u0027s live shows to join in the fun. At one point D’Angelo led a classic James Brown funk staple, holding three fingers in the air so the band could respond with three loud vamps. One encore was followed by a second that broke the curfew with free abandon, until D’Angelo was left on stage alone, reflective and blissful. It inspired a ine kind of worship, for a show that was appropriately titled The Second Coming. (Roisin O’Connor)A week before she played Brighton, I reviewed Lorde’s Alexandra Palace show in London. It was a five-star performance – the New Zealand musician exorcised the pain of the break-up she\u0027d chronicled on her brilliant second album Melodrama, twitching and twirling as an abstract house party played out in glass boxes around her. The stage design was so good, in fact, that Kanye West may or may not have nicked it a year later. Seeing her in Brighton the following week, without a notepad in my hand, I saw even more clearly all the intimate nuances of her performance – and was free to give in entirely to the exhilarating, heartbreaking melodrama of it all. (Alexandra Pollard)When you’ve been going to gigs for decades, you tend not to expect anything new, just variations – some mind-blowing, others not – on what you have seen before. So when I saw David Byrne’s American Utopia show, it felt like stumbling on the Ark of the Covenant. Here was a man who had been working in music for 40 years completely redrawing the rules of pop performance – no drum riser, no cables, no visible amps or microphones – and taking it deep into the territory of experimental theatre. In opposition to the usual freeform live music set-up, this tour was the result of fastidious planning, with everything rehearsed to the last nanosecond. And yet, forever on the move, dressed in matching grey suits and dancing barefoot in formation, Byrne and his 12-piece band were loose-limbed, unfettered and joyous to watch. And the music was pretty great too. (Fiona Sturges)1818 Christine and the Queens, Hammersmith Apollo, 2018Before her short run at Hammersmith Apollo last year, Héloïse Letissier – known as Christine and the Queens, though she dropped all but the Chris for her second album – tweeted: “I think we finally have some surprises for those who come to the shows!” She delivered on that promise – falling snow and sand, and a balcony homage to Romeo and Juliet – as she redefined what a pop show could be. With a gender-fluid cohort of athletic dancers, she brought to theatrical life her tumultuous journey towards embracing her pansexual identity, and finding liberation. And we went through all those emotions with her, those alternately tender and powerful vocals never faltering despite the restless dance routines. Everyone was on their feet dancing, and her declaration of inclusivity could not have been more empowering: “Vive everyone!” We left thrilled and elated. (Elisa Bray)“While I want nothing more than to bring my show to fans in Saudi Arabia, after better educating myself on the issues, I believe it is important for me to make clear my support for the rights of women, the LGBTQ community and freedom of expression,” Minaj said in a statement.Around a dozen Saudi women activists have been detained for the past year on charges related to human rights work and contacts with foreign journalists and diplomats.It is a case that has drawn global attention, particularly after last year’s murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month.

It appears to have been doing so as far as back as 10 billion years ago, when it was just forming, and those faint traces of smaller galaxies can still be seen to this day.Astronomers hope that the research can shed light on how our own galaxy will eventually be swallowed, and how it will come to its end. But it also opens up new mysteries about why and how Andromeda is destroying the galaxies that surround it.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe Milky Way is on a collision course with Andromeda in about four billion years. So knowing what kind of a monster our galaxy is up against is useful in finding out the Milky Way\u0027s ultimate fate, said Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspfrom the\u0026nbspAustralian National University\u0027s\u0026nbspResearch School of Astronomy and Astrophysics.Andromeda has a much bigger and more complex stellar halo than the Milky Way, which indicates that it has cannibalised many more galaxies, possibly larger ones.Huge ‘structures’ found floating in spaceTo piece together that ancient story, which is published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, researchers looked at dense clumps of stars that are known as\u0026nbspglobular clusters. Those show the signs of the ancient feasts, during which Andromeda would swallow its closer neighbours.That allowed them to see the fossils of long-dead galaxies, using them to understand the galaxies as they were when they lived, in the same way that fossils on Earth could shed light on ancient lives and deaths.By tracing the faint remains of these smaller galaxies with embedded star clusters, we\u0027ve been able to recreate the way Andromeda drew them in and ultimately enveloped them at the different times, Dr\u0026nbspMackey\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhile the study helps answer important questions about the fate of our galaxy, it also opens up new questions and mysteries. Scientists say that Andromeda\u0027s two rounds of feeding came from entirely different directions.This is very weird and suggests that the extragalactic meals are fed from what\u0027s known as the \u0027cosmic web\u0027 of matter that threads the universe, said Professor Lewis from the Sydney Institute for Astronomy and University of Sydney School of Physics, who co-led the study with Dr Mackey.More surprising is the discovery that the direction of the ancient feeding is the same as the bizarre \u0027plane of satellites\u0027, an unexpected alignment of dwarf galaxies orbiting Andromeda.Those planes can be torn up by Andromeda\u0027s own gravity within the space of a few billion years, according to previous research by the same scientists.This deepens the mystery as the plane must be young, but it appears to be aligned with ancient feeding of dwarf galaxies. Maybe this is because of the cosmic web, but really, this is only speculation, Professor Lewis said.We\u0027re going to have to think quite hard to unravel what this is telling us.Astronomers also hope that the discovery could help us to learn more about our own galaxy, and how it will continue to evolve.One of our main motivations in studying astronomy is to understand our place in the Universe. A way of learning about our galaxy is to study others that are similar to it, and try to understand how these systems formed and evolved.\u0026nbspSometimes this can actually be easier than looking at the Milky Way, because we live inside it and that can make certain types of observations quite difficult.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month. The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit. The argument goes that firms can let workers go if their sales drop, whereas investment in machinery is a more permanent expense.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They saw it as an issue that should be fixable.”Iran has a plan B thanks to China and Russia – and it might beat TrumpScholars also say the rising clout of Afghans inside Iran may have also prodded the Council of s to go against its ultra-conservative track record and approve the law.\u0026nbspThat thousands of Afghan migrants took up arms in the Iranian effort to bolster Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria may have boosted the image of Afghans in conservative circles that dominate the judiciary.“The state has to increasingly pay attention to them over time,” said Kevan Harris, a sociologist specialising in Iran at the University of California in Los Angeles. “And not all of these families are poor. There is a rising Afghan-headed middle class.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailZuzanna Olszewska, a\u0026nbspUniversity of Oxford\u0026nbspanthropologist specialising in the Afghan population of Iran, estimated about 100,000 children of Afghan fathers in Iran. They are among\u0026nbsphundreds of thousands of Afghans who\u0027ve lived in Iran since the beginning of their countries wars in the 1980s without paths to naturalisation.\u0026nbspMany of them have lived in the country for up to four decades, have contributed enormously to the economy in back-breaking jobs, and have gone about quietly improving their situations through education and hard work, she said. They have also integrated well into Iranian urban neighbourhoods, share Iranian culture, speak Persian with an Iranian accent, and a large proportion are also committed\u0026nbspShi\u0027a\u0026nbspMuslims. This probably accounts for their growing voice in the country\u0027s political life.Demographic factors including an ageing workforce and declining birth rates have made Iran friendlier towards immigration.\u0026nbspMr Harris also suggested that there was rising pressure from international organisations such as the UN\u0026nbspHigh Commission on Refugees, which continues to bankroll projects in Iran for those escaping conflicts in neighbouring Iraq and Afghanistan.\u0026nbspTo pass the law, parliament had to give way on security screening for anyone obtaining citizenship, which allowed\u0026nbspthe intelligence branch of the Revolutionary Guard to vet any applicant.\u0026nbspThe new rules don’t completely equalise access to citizenship. Iranian women must still apply for nationality for their children, while it is automatic for men’s children.“The children of all citizens, whether men or women, should instead be granted citizenship on an equal basis,” the advocacy group Human Rights Watch said earlier this year.\u0026nbspDespite the caveats, those inside Iran celebrated the change as a step forward. Any law that improves the lives of\u0026nbspIranian people is a step forward, said one Tehran social scientist, who spoke on condition her name not be published. There are so many limitations in Iran that each step forward is a good one.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Around  years ago, as co-presenter of BBC’s live TV show Crimewatch Daily, I interviewed a man called Mick North.Mr North was a lecturer in biochemistry at Stirling University in Scotland and, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, his we Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer and died just two and a half years later – leaving him with a toddler to bring up alone.On March , , he dropped Sophie – by then aged five – at school and headed off to work.The school was Dunblane Primary and she was shot dead by social misfit Thomas Hamilton who, armed with the four guns and  cartridges he owned legally, massacred  pupils and one teacher.In , after writing a book about the tragedy, Mr North came on the show to tell his heart-breaking story and to explain why, in , he had joined the Gun Control Network to campaign for tighter vetting.Sympathising with a man who had lost his daughter in such unconscionable circumstances, I simply said something along the lines of, “I’m not surprised” – a comment seized upon as “partisan” by the gun lobby, who then bombarded the BBC with complaints.The next day I was forced to apologise on air.Yes, it’s important that those presenting on the BBC are seen to be impartial when discussing politics but, be it Naga, citing her own experiences of racism or, in my case, sympathising with a man asking for tighter gun laws after his young daughter was shot dead, these are human reactions that should be judged using common sense, not boiler-plate rules.IN Debbie Harry’s compelling memoir, Face It, she writes about the time David Bowie was backstage with her and rock star Iggy Pop.She says: “David pulled out his c*ck – asI were the official c*ck checker or something.“He loved to pull it out, with both men and women.

But in the case of the traditional media, he mustn’t wield the loss of his mother as a weapon to try to shut down valid criticism that questions why, for example, he preaches about climate change one day then climbs aboard a private jet the next.Princess Diana was media savvy and close friends with several influential journalists.In his recent memoir, former Vogue publisher Nicholas Coleridge relayed the story of a lunch they shared that he had gone to great s to keep secret.But as she left, he says four photographers, “sprang forward, taking a thousand snaps”.Another example of “Diana, the hunted” perhaps Later, Coleridge rang a newspaper friend to ask how the picture desk had known and got the reply: “Diana rang herself from her car, on her way to lunch. She often tips them off about where she’ll be.”Equally, on the night of her death, she was safely ensconced in the Paris Ritz but chose, at midnight, to leave in a car being driven by a man three times over the French drink-driving limit.That is not to say the media — and, in particular, the paparazzi — didn’t sometimes step out of line, but unlike her youngest son, Diana knew not to judge all by the actions of a few.Presumably, the Sussexes hope The Mail on Sunday will cave in before it gets to court, but the paper is insisting it will defend the action “vigorously”.If so, Thomas Markle will be the star witness, and potentially Meghan herself — an event that will draw far more publicity to the Duchess’s turbulent family background than any article we have all long forgotten about.During the South Africa tour, Harry told -year-old student Peter Oki he was so overwhelmed by the world’s problems that it was sometimes hard to get out of bed in the mornings.Perhaps he should try embarking on a tour of the UK, where millions of his subjects are coping with issues without the cushion of wealth and privilege he enjoys.Hard-working people who, after the daily grind of keeping their head above water, simply don’t have time to obsess over perceived slights.Of course, there is one sure-fire route to greater privacyHarry and Meghan desire it.Give up the royal title , get a full-time job and pay for your own house renovations, like the rest of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I want the best for you because I know that’s exactly what Botham would do,” Brandt said on the stand.He added: I love you as a person.

After now, I leave Dallas but you live in Dallas. and it must stop for everyone.The sentencing was earlier met with boos and jeers by a crowd gathered outside the courtroom.Its a slap in the face, one woman told reporters.As the victims family walked out of the courtroom after the hearing, the group in the hallway began a chant of No justice! No peace!Sherfs deputies then cleared the hallway outside the courtroom before more officers escorted Guygers family out and down a side staircase.The shooting drew widespread attention in the US because of the strange circumstances and as it was one in a string of shootings of unarmed black men by white cops.In emotional testimony last week, Guyger said she blasted the -year-old because she thought he was a burglar and feared for her le.Jurors had to decideGuyger had a valid defence under Texas’ so-called “castle doctrine - which gives people the right to defend their own home.The -year-old had claimed she parked on the wrong floor of the complex by mistake and entered Jean’s flat, thinking it was hers.She was fired from the Dallas police department and indicted on a murder charge shortly after the shooting.The aftermath of the killing was captured on bodycam footage after fellow officers were called.Jurors were shown the disturbing scenes at the ongoing murder trial of the former Dallas cop.Armed officers are seen sprinting up four flights of stairs to the scene of the shooting.When the cops enter the flat, Guyger says: I thought it was my apartment...I thought it was my apartment.The officers then start performing CPR on the shooting victim saying come on Jean, come on Jean.For more than seven minutes they fought to save his le as he lay bleeding on his lounge floor.Jeans mother, sister and other family members left the courtroom just before the video was played.Guyger was tired after working  hours in four days and was on autopilot, her defence attorney Robert Rogers told jurors.The prosecution, however, alleged Guyger, a five-year veteran of the force, missed numerous signs she was on the wrong floor and in the wrong apartment - including a red doormat and clutter in the kitchen.They also claimed she then failed to adequately try to save Jean after shooting him.Despite being in the hallway when officers arrived, Guyger has said she provided first aid to Jean, according to an affidavit.It was also claimed Guyger was more concerned with her own le and career than she was with the dying Jean, reports CNN.When you listen critically to what she is saying, you are going to hear that she is as concerned or more concerned about how this is going to affect her than this poor guy on the floor next to her, prosecutor Jason Hermus told jurors.While she was on the phone with a  operator, she also sent texts to her partner on the force, with whom she was intimate, saying: I need you hurry and I f***ed up, Hermus said.Hermus also sought to show that Guyger violated police protocol by opening fire on her neighbour in the first place.Jean was on his couch in his shorts, watching TV and eating vanilla ice cream when Guyger walked through the front door, Hermus said.Under the circumstances, he said, protocol demanded that she take cover and call for backup instead of opening fire.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I cant rememberTyrone or she mentioned that she was dating a footballer.She mentioned she was upset with the way she was treated by him. She wanted to expose him to his missus or something like that.We discussed what she could do. She had a few options. I mentioned to her she could sell it to newspapers.Rowe said the plan was to take incriminating footage of Wood with the footballer in the hotel room. But he told the court he was surprised when he actually saw the footballer.Rowe was convicted of two counts of theft, relating to the footballers designer tracksuit and Rolex watch.He will be sentenced on November  with Natalie Wood, , who previously admitted conspiring to blackmail the sportsman.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How dare you!”The teen’s fiery speech was hailed by millions, with climate change activists taking to the streets in huge protests around the world.But others were less impressed, including Donald Trump who sarcastically mocked her as a “very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future”.French President Emmanuel Macron also warned her “radical” climate change stance risks “depressing” an entire generation.And some iniduals were even more scathing, with sick trolls branding her “the little girl with mental problems”, and others suggesting she’s “not sexy enough” in vile rants.But Putin said young people who paid attention to environmental issues should be supported.However, he cautioned: “When someone is using children and teenagers in personal interests, it only deserves to be condemned.“I’m sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl.“But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations.”But critics point out that despite signing up to the Paris climate agreement last month, Russia has long ignored the issue of climate change.In fact, it even stands to benefit economically as it looks to take advantage of the thawing Arctic to create a new shipping channel along its usually frozen northern coast.Putin himself has also said climate change isn’t man-made and expressed scepticism about renewable energy.He said wind turbines killed birds and disturbed worms – claims he was widely mocked for in Russia despite a law against insulting officials."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures superyachts monaco","story":"The mulit-million pound vessels radiate as they illuminate the water during the glamorous Monaco Yacht Show in Port Hercules.It is understood an estimated £.billion worth of vessels were on display during the opulent showcase.More than  yachts were showcased during the event, which has been running for almost three decades.The billionaires toys ranged from  feet to  feet in .Most yachts were moored up in the bay, but as space is limited others spend the night anchored further out to sea.A-listers such as actor Leonardo Di Caprio, former Beatle Ringo Starr, Tennis champion Novak Djokovic and F star Lewis Hamilton were said to be at the luxurious event, according to Boat International.The show is Europes largest in-water display of yacht and lasted from September  to .Earlier this year, one of the worlds largest and most futuristic superyachts had coasted into Monaco.Russian tycoon Andrey Melnichenko’s one-off £million vessel was designed by Philippe Starck and is ft long, has eight decks, a helicopter pad, a pool and masts that are ft tall.It is named Sailing Yacht A because the super wealthy industrialist likes his vessels to be listed first in shipping registers.Brothers JP Andrews and Mike Andrews, who are from Wolverhampton and specialise in aerial photography, captured the fantastic images using a drone.Mike, , said: We could see tenders shuttling back and forth from the land, which contained guests or occupants of the yachts but the majority of the people on board were inside enjoying the luxuries of their yachts.The glow in the water from the lighting was what sparked our interest.

We will not buy that.”The Taoiseachs blast has infuriated Brexiteers with Tory MP Peter Bone calling the comments “extraordinary” and “meddling”.Mr Bone told MailOnline: “We had a once in a letime referendum and there was a very clear majority for leaving the EU.“What is even more strange is this is on the day that the Prime Minister came to the House of Commons with a very generous deal to the EU and particularly to Ireland.”Tory MP Nigel Evans said: “The British people voted to leave the EU. We are democrats in the UK and we have never ignored a result of a referendum unlike other EU countries including Ireland.”But Mr Varadkar has been supported by Brussels as Donald Tusk said he was “unconvinced” by Mr Johnson’s plans.Mr Tusk, European Council President, tweeted: “Today I had two phone calls on Brexit, first with Dublin then with London.“My message to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar : We stand fully behind Ireland.“My message to PM Boris Johnson : We remain open but still unconvinced.”As well as Dublin and Brussels, Mr Johnson must now work to convince MPs that his plan is the right Brexit option.In order to secure a Commons majority he needs to win over the DUP, Tory Brexiteers and Labour Euroscepticshe has any chance of pushing his proposal over the line.Laying out his plan to MPs today, he said: This government has moved.“Our proposals do represent a comprise and I hope the House can come together in the national interest behind this new deal and open a new chapter of friendship with our European partners.“Let us seize this moment to honour our promise to British people, respect Brexit and get Brexit done.”But Mr Corbyn blasted the proposals as a “rehash” of previous Brexit proposals and said Mr Johnson was leading Britain into a “race to the bottom”.The Labour boss added: “Deal or no deal this government’s agenda is clear – they want a Trump deal Brexit that would crash our economy.However, the Mr Johnson was offered a boost when leading Tory Brexiteer Mark Francois spoke out in support of his new agreement.The PM will need the support of Conservative Eurosceptic group the ERG, of which Mr Francois is deputy chair,he wants to get his deal through the Commons.Boris adopted a constructive tone during today’s proceedings in direct reaction to the storm created by the storm caused by his “humbug” comment in the Commons last week.In response he also told opposition MPs that he was “concerned” by their aggressive tone when grilling him over Brexit.Mr Johnson was also keen to show the House his efforts to take a constructive tone with Brussels.He his deal would bridge the chasm between the two sides and the government would go the extra mile to get Brexit done.The change of tack from Boris comes after the PM was rebuked for his constant use of the term “surrender bill” to describe the Brexit-blocking Benn Act, last week.Labour MP Paula Sherf later clashed with Mr Johnson after she suggested that his “offensive and dangerous language” could lead to attacks on politicians and pointed to a plaque of murdered MP Jo Cox.The PM described the comment as “humbug” – causing widespread outrage - but later apologised.Mr Johnson appeared in the Commons after holding a crunch Cabinet meeting this morning.The PM dragged his ministers in for an emergency meeting while EU chiefs pick apart his new Brexit plan.Mr Johnson described his five-point proposal as a “fair and reasonable compromise” during the Tory party conference in Manchester yesterday.Boris hopes to now pull together a majority of MPs to back his Brexit proposals.So far the PM believes he could get the support of the DUP, Tory Brexiteers and Labour Eurosceptics which could be enough to get his plan over the line.Murmurs from No suggest the PM could jet off to Brussels for a whistle-stop tour of EU capitals, the Daily Mail reports.This would start with a trip to German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.Boris’ main priority in the coming days will be to persuade EU chiefs that his deal is the right option to break the Brexit deadlock over the Northern Irish backstop.Mr Varadkar is one of the leaders that will take the most convincing.The Taoiseach said: “What we are hearing is not encouraging and would not be the basis for agreement.”Mr Johnson’s five points, set out in a letter to the EU, are:The PM used his first conference speech as party leader to tee up his ideas.But he again asserted that Britain would leave the EU on October  “come what may”.Mr Johnson also bluntly declared “the alternative is No Deal”.He told the conference: “That is not an outcome we want.It is not an outcome we seek at all.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly .

For the Tories, it is a clear goal of policy.In his ambitious speech to the conference, the Chancellor Sajid Javid – who is the son of a bus driver – declared that the Living Wage would rise over the next five years from the present rate of £.-an-hour to £.-an-hour - and the age limit lowered from  to .Altogether, it is estimated that at least four million people will benefit from these far-reaching changes.The Chancellor’s scheme exposes all the left-wing nonsense about Tory toffs.This is not the action of a Government that is driven by concern only for the wealthy or is indferent to the struggles of those on limited earnings.A modern, thriving economy cannot be built on the back of exploitation and poverty pay.Anyone who goes out to work is entitled to a level of pay that can sustain a reasonable standard of living.Those who object to Sajid Javid’s proposal should be askedthey would be willing to work for less than £.-an-hour.In fact, it is depressing that so many people who do invaluable jobs in the community, like care home workers, hospitality staff and retailers are currently paid less than this.Looking after the elderly or disabled should be well-rewarded positions, not jobs hovering at the level of the minimum wage.Indeed, ever since they came to power in , the Conservatives have prioritised the quest to improve living standards and reward those who hold down jobs.That is why the Government has dramatically cut income tax for the low paid by raising the personal allowance from £,-a-year in  to £, this year.As a result, more than four million people who earn beneath this threshold no longer have to pay income tax at all.Meanwhile, contrary to all the rancid hysteria about alleged Tory bias to the rich, the top one per cent of earners now pay  per cent of all income tax.The Conservatives’ claim to be the party of the workers is further reinforced by their jobs miracle, which far exceeds anything achieved where in Europe.When the Tories took office in , there were widespread predictions that they would preside over soaring dole queues.Just the opposite happened. In the last nine years, no fewer than .million new jobs have been created, most of them full-time.Today, unemployment stands at just . per cent, the lowest level since . Over  per cent of the population is now in work, a historic record, with more women in the workplace than ever before and wages are now growing at their fastest rate in a decade.Inflation is low, while credit and mortgages have never been cheaper, which – along with tax cuts – boosts household budgets.Similarly, a consumer study out this week showed that expenditure on dining out is at its highest level for three years.Tory economic success, in the face of Labour’s hysterical gloom-mongering, points to a fundamental dference between the parties.The Conservatives believe in providing incentives towards diligence and enterprise.In contrast, Labour is ideologically obsessed with levelling down, trying to achieve a dogmatic form of equality through higher taxes, massive redistribution of wealth and lavish social security benefits.As history has continually taught us, it is a disastrous recipe for economic sclerosis and welfare dependency.Raising pay rather than benefits is the best way to bolster living standards.A generous welfare system is a heavy drag on the economy, not only because it imposes a huge burden on the taxpayer but also because it discourages work.On the other hand, a reasonable minimum wage raises productivity in the workplace, puts more money in the pockets of employees and expands the economy.The main objection to a higher minimum comes from employers, who argue that, because of rising costs, staff will be priced out of jobs - but there is little evidence to support such warnings.The same anxieties were voiced when Labour under Tony Blair first campaigned in  for the introduction of a minimum wage.At the time, the Tories said that policy would destroy jobs, particularly among young people. But such dire forecasts never materialised.Thankfully, the Conservatives have learnt that such messages of economic doom are hollow.It will turn our economy into a pioneer, with one of the highest statutory minimums in the world.Inevitably Labour has been carping this week, with the Shadow Chancellor bleating about the Tories’ pathetic attempt at catch-up.But such language just demonstrates Labour’s fear - as their mantle of the party of the workers is steadily pulled from their grasp."},{"url":null,"title":"bercow makes kangaroo testicle joke in commons","story":"Mr Bercow quipped on his croaky voice following the dig by the PM at the Tory party conference yesterday.The Speaker, who was suffering from a sore throat, told the Commons today: “I want to take the opportunity to confirm to the House that the state of my throat, which is purely temporary, is not down to the consumption of a kangaroo’s testicle.“I wouldn’t eat it, it would probably be poisoned.”The joke came after Boris told fellow MPs thatParliament were a TV show they all deserved to be “voted out” before taking a swipe at ardent Remainer Mr Bercow.Boris Johnson mocked the Commons for its efforts to block Brexit and joked that he would like to make Mr Bercow do a revolting Bush Tucker Trial.The Speaker - who once had a b****cks to Brexit sticker on his car - has infuriated Mr Johnson with what he sees as anti-Government bias over Brexit.Mr Johnson told Tory delegates: “If Parliament were a reality TV show then the whole lot of us Im afraid would have been voted out of the jungle by now.“But at least we would have the consolation of watching the speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle.”After the banter in the Commons, Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom was quick to send Mr Bercow her own supportive message.She tweeted: Get well soon @HoC_Speaker_MP!

The extra money for schools, hospitals and the police are clearly an election bribe that do not compensate for cuts imposed since .    He has driven moderate Tories from his party and deepened isions with his incendiary and ill-tempered language.

The woman had lived with an elderly relative, who was a hoarder, and filled their home with so much stuff they had to sleep in deckchairs by the front door for three decades. After the homeowner died, the pensioner endured the filth until a removals firm heard about her plight - and cleared the home for free. Kent-based removals firm Klutter King spent a week cleaning the house from top to bottom - and moved more than  tonnes of rubbish to the tip. Owner Kevin Porter said: The poor tenant began lodging with the relative in the early s. The relativeaposs compulsive hoarding got worse when her partner died.  We found piles of clothes, shoes, books, umbrellas and rotting food tins all over the house when we arrived. The food cans had been there for so long the contents had vanished and the tins were crumbling. The relative, who owned the property in Maidstone, Kent, died in , by which time the pensioner was too frail to sht the waste. Mr Porter, , of East Peckham, Kent, added: Iaposve cleared a lot of houses since forming the company. In most cases itaposs when someone has died or moved into a care home. But this one got me emotionally because of how this person had been made to live. They didnapost even have a bed and in the summertime they slept in the garage because it was too hot. Itaposs such a sad story. To make things worse, the landlady left the property to charity and not the relative.  It took six men seven days to clear decades of junk, which involved dozens of trips to the tip. Mr Porter added: It was so satisfying to finish because it seemed like the job was never going to end. At the halfway point I thought aposwhat am I doing , because we didnapost think we would ever finish. The tenant asked the clearance team to look out for a £, piece of jewellery which had become lost in the rubbish. The team were not hopeful they would find it, but eventually uncovered the lost treasure and ed it to the delighted owner. Mr Porter said: Most clearance companies make their profits from selling on expensive items. We donapost do that. I havenapost got it in me. The owner couldnapost believe it when we ed the jewellery. After the mess had been shted, the team mopped the floors and cleaned the walls which had been blocked for years.

In the order of service booklet, a picture of Libby smiling can been seen underneath the words: If there ever comes a day when we canapost be together, keep me in your heart, Iaposll stay there forever. And during the ceremony, Libbyaposs mum Lisa took the microphone to read the touching peom. Wherever You Are, My Love Will Find You is a children’s book written by author Nancy Tillman, and Lisa adapted it to reflect the relationship with her late daughter. Promising her daughter she will “never be alone”, and her love for her “will never fade”, the poem shows the love that surrounded Libby throughout her  years. Wherever You Are, My Love Will Find You I wanted you more than you will ever know, So I sent love to follow wherever you go, It’s as high as you wish it, it’s as quick as an elf, You will never outgrow it, it stretches itself. So climb any mountain, climb up to the sky, My love will find you, my love can fly, Make a big splash, go out on a limb, My love will find you, my love can swim. It never gets lost, never fades, never ends, If you are working, or playing or sitting with friends, You can dance ‘til you’re dizzy and sing out your blues, There’s no place, not one, that my love can’t find you. Andone day you’re lonely or someday you’re sad, Or feeling abandoned or think you’ve been bad, Just lt up your face, feel the wind in your hair, That’s me my sweet baby, my love is right there. In the green of the grass, in the smell of the sea, In the clouds floating by, in the tops of the tree, In the sounds that you hear throughout the day, You are loved, you are loved, you are love they all say. My love is so high, so wide and so deep, It’s always right there even when you’re asleep, So hold your head high and don’t be afraid, To march to the front of your own parade. When you were my little small babe and now you’re all grown, My promise to you is that you’re never alone, You are my angel, my darling, my Pie, my star, And my love will find you wherever you are.   The desperate search for Libby got under way on February  after she vanished when she was turned away from the Welly nightclub in Beverley Road, Hull, the night before. Her body was pulled from the Humber estuary seven weeks later on March . St Lawrence Church warden Alison Rimmer said: The West Wycombe community have been very shocked and deeply saddened by the tragic death of Libby. Libby grew up in the village and attended local schools and college before going to the University of Hull. She was very much a loved family member and very dear friend to all those who grew up with her or met her along the way.  Today’s service at St Lawrence brings together the whole community and many others who want to remember Libby and pay tribute to all the joy that she brought to them. Our thoughts and prayers are especially with Lisa and Russell, and all their family who are heartbroken at her loss.  Rest in peace dear Libby. Todayaposs ceremony is being conducted by Reverend Jenny Ellis. Earlier today, she said: “We are expecting around  people to attend. It promises to be emotional and highly charged. “There will be family, friends, those from the local community, people for the Hull community and Hull University. “I didn’t know Libby personally but I feel like I got to know her speaking to Russell and Lisa.  “She was a remarkable young woman who stood up for the underdog, never judged anyone and was full of love and le who knew those around her loved her too.” Earlier this year Detective Superintendent Martin Smalley, who is leading the investigation, explained why the body could not be released sooner. He said: “Libby’s death remains, and is being investigated, as a homicide, with numerous inquiries, analysis and examinations continuing to take place as part of the investigation with assistance from search specialists as well as experts in forensics and oceanography to aid its progression.

Iaposm really not a fan of that behaviour. I know people tend to be quite ignorant on their commute.

Emily Gosling, , had been working for her familyaposs rum business in Ontario, Canada since  - before relocating to London five years later. However before the move and during a business trip to Vancouver in May , she met wine director Dave Bulters, also . Despite the pair hitting it off instantly, Emily went on to relocate the next year - ing once more for a business trip to Canada where she went on her fist date with Dave Although living thousands of miles apart, they opted to try long distance - speaking about how theyaposd one day decorate a flat together and what trips they would take when they were reunited. However, earlier this year Emily began experiencing night sweats, bloating, kidney pain and fatigue before she was eventually given the devastating news in March that she had germ cell oian cancer. Within a week of her diagnosis, Dave flew to London to be with Emily. Emily began chemotherapy immediately, followed by surgery to remove the seven-inch tumour.    The cancer diagnosis derailed the coupleaposs plans to live together, but Dave made the decision to quit his job in Vancouver to move to London permanently so he could support Emily. Emily believes that the months spent living together in London deeply strengthened their relationship because he remained by her side throughout her cancer battle. She said: The afternoon of my diagnosis, I met with a gynaecological oncology surgeon to discuss my options. It was shocking to hear all of this over a few hours. Then a few days later, I had a CT scan to determine whether the cancer had spread, fortunately it hadnapost. My GP said that based on the results of the CT, and the size and speed of tumour growth, I would undergo four to six months of chemotherapy to shrink the tumour before they operated. Dave arrived in London on March , and he came to an appointment with my oncologist where we were hoping to arrange a treatment plan for when I ed to Vancouver. What we were told instead was that the tumour was too aggressive, and Iaposd be starting chemotherapy that evening! After being told the shocking news of how aggressive her cancer was, Emily said Dave immediately made the decision to quit his job to be at her side.    She added: Dave and I walked to a nearby park. It was there that he told me that he was going to quit his job and move to London. I was so relieved, but I was also so angry because cancer hadnapost only taken over my le, it had taken over his too. Emily began chemotherapy at the end of March before having surgery on May  to remove the tumour, which was seven inches long and over three inches wide. Surgeons also removed her right oy, right fallopian tube, appendix and lymph nodes, leaving her with  staples in her sternum. In June, Emilyaposs oncologist permitted her toto Vancouver to complete her treatment as her recovery from surgery was going well. Emily said she was proud of what their relationship has endured, adding: The one positive thing about the cancer diagnosis was that we got to live together sooner than weaposd planned, even though the situation wasnapost quite what we had planned. Thereaposs no doubt that the months in London strengthened our relationship.

Nicola Bevan told bosses she would need to take an emergency leave of absence from her job as a registered community health nurse. But while continuing to receive her monthly wage, the -year-old was running her private business, Youthful You Wales in Pencoed, which offered anti-ageing products including Botox injections.After Bevan’s line manager became suspicious an investigation was launched by the NHS counter-fraud team, reports Wales Online.Evidence was found on social media that she was trading.    They also discovered she had been duplicating prescriptions in order to obtain medications from pharmacies to be used in treatments. She did this to circumvent a process which required an independent prescriber to sign the prescription after taking into account the patient’s medical history. As well as avoiding paying fees to the independent prescriber, it was claimed Bevan put her patients at risk as they could have been given treatments that were dangerous for them. A sentencing hearing at Cardf Crown Court on Wednesday heard Bevan, of Pencoed, was employed by the Swansea Bay University Health Board and had worked as a nurse for  years. Prosecutor Carl Harrison said the defendant signed a contract at the beginning of her employment agreeing not to carry out private medical work without the permission of the health board.    Bevan remained on sick leave from December  to June  during which time she received a total of £, in wages. Since her conviction she has fully repaid the amount she received during this period, the court heard. In regards to the prescription fraud, the defendant had duplicated  prescriptions. When confronted about her behaviour Bevan denied she had been working but later admitted to running a business while on sick leave. She also initially claimed she believed prescriptions could be submitted twice to a pharmacy. The defendant later pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud and one count of dishonestly failing to disclose information to make a gain for herself. The court heard she had previous convictions for the possession and production of cannabis.

his chance soon.And he hopes Devlin, pictured, can take his opportunity at international level when it arises.Irvine said: “I’m delighted for Mikey to be in the Scotland squad again.“The Scotland manager sees something in Mikey andhe can get a cap that will be the icing on the cake for him.“The experience of having been in the squad will help his development as a player.“He has been doing well with Aberdeen and he knows he needs to keep that up at club level.“The chances will come as they have with Scott McKenna and when the opportunity is there it’s up to Mikey to take it.“He’s untested at international level, but it may depend on the opposition as to whether he gets a cap.“If he was going in against Belgium that might not be ideal for a first cap.“But with Russia and Sam Marino the next two games they may be good for Mikey to bed into the national team.“Hopefully, he can keep learning and improving.”Irvine is a big fan of Devlin, who joined Aberdeen from Hamilton Accies in January .He admires Devlin’s approach to his defensive work and believes he could do an important job for Scotland.Irvine added: “As a former centre-half I really enjoy watching him play. Whenever I see Aberdeen play I always watch Mikey closely.“I see a lot of positives in the way he plays. Defensively there’s no frills and he gets the job done.“That’s what the job of a defender is – to win tackles, win headers and organise his back four.“On the ball it’s about playing a simple ball up the line or into a midfielder.“The stock skills you need to be a good defender, Mikey has them all in his armoury.“Some defenders are expected to play great passes and to try to play out from the back all the time.“But I’m not so interested in that.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future. In addition, in recognition of their support and contribution to our community, we are also making a donation to the Lochgilphead High School art and design department.We thank all of our patients for working with us over the past few years as changes have been made which require adjustment on all sides. Your understanding and patience is very much appreciated as we seek to find the safest way to deliver the most effective and high quality health care for us all.We look forward to seeing the talent of our local young people when competition entries close on October  and celebrating that talent when we announce our winner on October .Dr Andrew Strain, Lochgilphead Medical Centre and Furnace and Inveraray SurgerySir,My favourite activity at this time of the year is picking brambles. Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

And why in one car park do you pay a charge only on a Saturday, but in another you pay every day Back in  the Area Partnership Forum formed a committee to look at off-street car parking in the town. In  they implemented new off-street parking conditions.Councillor Tatler branded the parking arrangement ldquounusual. He explained: ldquoWe have a big carpark where there is no charge all week and then there is on a Saturday. We have another smaller carpark where there is a charge, and then there is a free carpark.ldquoThe logic behind that was it would suit all the dferent people that would require car parking, so residents, visitors, traders and commuters as well.ldquoWhen they made that decision they said that they would review it and it should be reviewed regularly. We are now looking at not far short of five years later.But after suggesting a car parking review at the June meeting of the Area Partnership, there wasnrsquot a consensus amongst the six councillors.ldquoMyself and Councillor Eric Small feel that now would be a good time to have a look at it again. We will do research and gather evidence and report back to the future Area Partnership meeting.The councillors intend to go out into the community and talk to traders but they also want to hear from locals.Councillor Tatler said: ldquoWe would like to hear from the readers of the Peeblesshire. Do people think itrsquos worth us looking at those car parks does it still work for everybody ldquoI have had representation from constituents that during the summer months they find it dficult to park. I have also heard from people confused by the system. Also are we providing for commuters  I think itrsquos great that people park and ride, do we maybe need a separate facility somewhere or a distinct park and ride section. If everyone thinks its fine then wersquoll leave it.But the Tweeddale councillor thinks that the general public do want change.He told us: ldquoTherersquos a worry that we might be losing trade from visitors who come into the car park, circle round and then leave. Also there is a lack of signage directing visitors to car parks, so is this something we need to address Peebles Community Council is in favour of the review, as is the Community Trust.But what do you think.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

Sheep can be used in so many ways to benefit the environment and naivety from mainstream media risks increasing our environmental footprint.’Livestock is also widely criticised for its methane emissions which NSA say is, again, misleading.Mr Stocker added: ‘Methane shouldn’t be ignored it is an emitted gas that has an impact on global warming.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into contact with one of her lsquocommunity connectorsrsquo related to a certain activity.Community connectors are volunteers from a iety of local groups and clubs, and people who are willing to help out in a iety of the initiativersquos smaller projects.ldquoWe are not pushing them into it, said Carol.ldquoThe connector could give them a realistic sense of what the group is like.Connectors can also volunteer their time to accompany someone, for example, to the gym on a one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you have been through something that is a huge setback then your confidence is that much lower.As well as mental health, other reasons people could use Community Connections could be due to accident, illness or being new to the area.The project is being funded by the area partnership for one year and is actively looking for more funding to allow it continue.Anyone keen to get involved should

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

We are told there is a two week wait when all the anecdotal evidence is that it is at least threenot four weeks.A spokesperson from Riverside said: ldquoIn East Lothian, as in many parts of Scotland, people are living longer with increasingly complex health and care needs.ldquoIn response to this growing challenge, Riverside Medical Practice has been working hard over the last few years to transform the way our patients are being cared for, working closely with a wider range of healthcare professionals to ensure the right care is provided by the right person at the time help is needed.ldquoThrough this, the practice has made signicant improvements in providing lsquosame dayrsquo appointments for those whose health concern may be urgent.

But the firm has been dealt a major blow after its bid for a Government contract to buy the electricity produced by the windfarm failed. And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing. Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Tories minimum wage shift shows politics is moving left","story":"And what better politician to apply the phrase to than Boris Johnson, accused of what has become known as ldquothigh-gate ndash that he placed his hand on a woman journalists leg  years ago. He denies it, of course. But for advocates of the personal is political, his casual conduct is of immense signicance.Similarly, language and the PMs use of military metaphors betray personal traits that are politically signicant. His resort to words like ldquohumbug and ldquoSurrender Act are supposedly windows into the corrupt soul of a misogynistic micro-fascist. I hereby claim , by the way, on the term ldquomicro-fascist, which is an extension of the idea of ldquomicro-aggressions, so popular on university campuses among people who believe tiny things matter a lot.But do they  The media is obsessed with language right now, and personal conduct, possibly because many of its practitioners grew up with the personal is political phrase ringing in their ears. Twitter cant get enough of this stuff, though its no slouch itself when it comes to aggressive language. ldquoRacist, Liar. Misogynist. Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns. Doesnt mean they want to kill you with cannons.Indeed,military metaphors are to be regarded as incitements to violence, then Sir John Curtice had better watch out when he next talks of the general election ldquocampaign being a ldquobattleground with ldquotarget seats, an ldquoair war and a ldquodecapitation strategy. Boris Johnson just makes jokes about all this synthetic outrage. Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious. Sajid Javid says he is adopting their policy of a living wage set at % median earnings, to eliminate poverty pay in a decade.Now, they may not mean it. But it seems to me something pretty fundamental is going on undergrowth of British politicsthe Conservatives are even talking this way. The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-women-need-support-partner-men","story":"Those of us unfamiliar with the English judiciary had probably never heard of her until a couple of weeks ago, but as the arc lamp of publicity was turned in her direction and newspaper profiles prolerated, every word Brenda Hale spoke was hoovered up. People were particularly fascinated, it seemed, in her arresting collection of jewelled insect brooches. Yet what has struck me is her advice on how a woman can reach the top of her profession.Lady Hale offered her hard-won guidance at the launch of a group called Cambridge Women in Law. A graduate of Girton College, she told those following in her footsteps that few females can reach the upper echelons of the male-dominated legal world entirely by their own efforts. For starters, they will be battling against an engrained masculine sense of entitlement that puts them at an immediate disadvantage. Even more signicant, however, is their domestic situation. ldquoProbably the most important thing when you are making your way as a woman in the law is to choose the right partner, she said, doubtless making some of her listeners delete their last text message demanding to know what time theyrsquod be home to make dinner.:Boris Johnson cant remember grope allegation eventTwice married, Hale was quick to note that her first husband as well as her second had been completely supportive. Despite all her intellectual and emotional capabilities, which in a perfect universe would catapult her and those like her to stardom whatever their personal circumstances, she was unequivocal. The choice of whether to have a le partner, and who that partner is, will prove vital to a womanrsquos advancement. Clearly, what holds for the law is equally true for other walks of le. Facebookrsquos chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wrote, ldquoI donrsquot know of one woman in a leadership position whose le partner is not fully ndash and I mean fully ndash supportive of her career.You need only think of Philip May, acting discreetly behind the arras as Theresa Mayrsquos unofficial consigliere to see this principle borne out. While the PM negotiated the most dficult job in Europe, grafting into the small hours, and on call night and day, he provided the psychological underpinning, or scaffolding, on which she stood. That ultimately her plans imploded does not diminish the fact that without his bolstering presence, his enabling faith in her ability to carry on, she would not have had the mental strength to persevere to the bitter end.Finding a partner who will be wholly encouraging isnrsquot easy. Too often the romantic knot has been tied long before the pressures of a womanrsquos career begin to escalate. If by then a couple have children, it takes deep pockets to pay for household help and childcare while two demanding vocations are conducted at full throttle, or an unusually far-sighted and self-abnegating companion prepared to put their own job, and ego, into cold storage for a few years.Such iniduals do exist, but finding him or her, while in the first flush of youth, takes greater maturity than most possess. Conversely, by the time a woman is older, wiser, and more established in her role, the biological clock can be ticking so loudly it drowns out common sense when getting hitched. Add to this the fact that women in all-consuming careers, such as medicine, law or the media, tend to get involved with those in equally full-on occupations, with similarly vaulting ambitions.:Boris Johnson to make final offer to EU on BrexitLady Halersquos comments will have struck a nerve with many working women. You can picture them, conducting a silent audit on their partners over the toast and marmalade, wonderingthey fall into the category of clinging ivy or storm-proof trellis. Yet the evidence of those who reach the top has been there all along, and what this high-flying judge says should come as no surprise.As far back as the s the brilliant mathematician Mary Somerville flourished because her second husband recognised her talent and gave her space to pursue her ideas. She still had to make sure the children were cared for, and was obliged to drop everything when guests unexpectedly called, but by the standards of the day her spousersquos attitudes were truly enlightened. Pierre Curie was another such enabler, while closer to our own times there has been no more devoted partner than Denis Thatcher or George Clooney, each treating his other halfrsquos ambitions with absolute seriousness.Weary of being an invisible launch-pad, some women like to quip: ldquoBehind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. Yet one of the questions Halersquos speech raises is whether or not men who aspire to be top dog are equally reliant on a partnerrsquos support. Could it be that, even in these more egalitarian times, women are more in need of a human coat of armour than men Like it or not, a high-powered position is not easy to sustain, whether yoursquore male or female. The toll on those at home is heavy. For true harmony, a household has room for only one stratospheric performer. Yet the back-up and moral support essential to someonersquos professional success is not the mundane business of stocking the fridge or doing the laundry, necessary though these are. Five-star house-keeping alone is not enough.If a partnership s like a Swiss watch, each cog performing its assigned role and never missing a beat, itrsquoll soon run into troublethere isnrsquot something more nourishing keeping it ticking. Surely itrsquos the deep emotional connection with a loved one, and the intellectual stimulation essential to a good relationship, that help a person achieve their best I will concede that most women probably need more overt confidence-boosting. Yet given the dearth of us at the pinnacle of whatever profession you care to name, itrsquos far too soon to know whether those who reach the uppermost rungs need more unconditional back-up from their partners than men.

Irsquove long championed reality TV. I just donrsquot rate The Apprentice or Bake-Off as great representatives of the genre. The best reality TV gives viewers a glimpse of whatrsquos shting about in the tectonic plates of our world, how humans feel right here and right now, how society is changing, how peoplersquos lives and attitudes are being shaped.Reality TV is the very heart of popular, mainstream entertainment. I donrsquot think you can fully get to grips with the world unless you embrace reality TV and use it to navigate not just pop culture, but wider culture. If you think Irsquom mad, let me call TS Eliot in defence. Eliot, probably the th centuryrsquos greatest poet, was a huge admirer of the Music Hall ndash which was seen, a century ago, as the home of trash entertainment. Culturally, Music Hall was the Edwardian equivalent of reality TV. Eliot, though, believed Music Hall ndash with its iety acts, smut and sentimentality ndash was the truest representation of the society within which he lived. He felt that the Music Hall singer and comedian Marie Lloyd ldquorepresented and expressed something signicant about the spirit of the nation. Roll forward  years and Eliot could have been speaking about Big Brotherrsquos Jade Goody.George Orwell was also a fan of Music Hall. Many like him saw it as having a ldquoredeeming socialas it held a mirror directly up to ordinary le.Big Brother had more social signicance in a single episode than every series of The Apprentice and the Bake-Off put together. From the get-go it showed society changing when it came to sexuality and gender. It revealed chasms of racism in Britain, which were not being discussed. It showed up our culturersquos cruelty, pettiness, narcissism, stupidity and greed. Yes, of course, it was manipulative, gaudy, and loud ndash but so was the Music Hall. You have to accept the bits you donrsquot like to get to the juice within.I find it an endless source of irony that the people who binge-eat The Apprentice and the Bake-Off sneer like Jacob Rees-Mogg confronted with a Greggs sausage roll when mention is made of shows like Big Brother.For the best of Reality TV, donrsquot bother watching The Apprentice tonight. Watch The Circle on Channel . Itrsquos as noisy and day-glo as Big Brother, but itrsquos also the most compelling dissection of the effects of social media on human beings that Irsquove ever seen.The show sees a group of strangers placed in isolation and only able to communicate via social media. On social media, they can be whoever they want to be. The last series was won by a man pretending to be a woman. Contestants are allowed to post fake pictures of themselves, or lie and manipulate. This series sees one man pretending to be a single mother, and a middle aged woman posing as a laddish bricklayer.As in the online world, people immediately place all emphasis on appearance ndash the selfie rules ndash but no-one knows whatrsquos fake, whatrsquos true. Contestants are addicted to clicks and likes. They lose touch with the real world and real human beings. They become needy, nervous, depressed, obsessed. They fall foul of group-think. They fear rejection ndash they crave the love of the online world they inhabit.On The Circle the mere act of posting a good or bad picture can change how everyone thinks of you. Itrsquos about curating your le so others see only your best side, not the real you. People share personal information in a way theyrsquod never do in real le. Acts of kindness are phoney and virtue-signalled. Everything comes with a hashtag and an emoji. Everything is manipulated. And when reality finally breaks in and the contestants meet each other in real le theyrsquore nothing like their digital selves. We see the real them ndash honest, shy, decent hellip normal.This is reality TV which explores the new reality in which we live: a phoney, empty, dumbed-down world thatrsquos a bit like an episode of The Apprentice or Bake-Off.Neil Mackay is Scotlandrsquos Columnist of the Year"},{"url":null,"title":"lib-dem-mp-rather-no-deal-brexit-jeremy-corbyn-pm","story":"Jamie Stone, the partyrsquos Scotland spokesman, seemed to say hewould choose no-deal ldquoevery time over handing the Labour leader the keys to Number .Labourrsquos shadow Scottish secretary Lesley Laird said Mr Stone had ldquolet the mask slip.:Mark Smith: Why on earth do so many people have a problem with Jo Swinson However, Mr Stone later insisted he had been misunderstood and was actually responding to an earlier question in which he had been asked to say which was worse, no-deal or Mr Corbyn as PM.Ms Laird said: ldquoDespite the spin about being a new and invigorated party under Jo Swinson, they [the Lib Dems] are the same party that inflicted austerity on the country and they are now willing to inflict a no-deal Brexit on the country.\"Labour has been saying for months that the Lib Dems would rather a no-deal Brexit than for Jeremy Corbyn to become interim Prime Minister.\"A no-deal Brexit would be a catastrophe for working people across the UK.

years.ldquoThis judgment recognised however that a childrsquos best interests are not merely medical, but include broader social and religious values. It also recognised the legal right of parents to request le-prolonging treatment in another EU state so that their child can be treated under that system of care and ethics.ldquoIt has been a very challenging and exhausting journey for Tafidarsquos parents. They look forward to her receiving outstanding care at the Gaslini hospital in Genoa. They will also feel at peace knowing that Tafida will be cared for under the Italian ethical and legal system.Lawyer Mathieu Culverhouse, who works at law firm Irwin Mitchell and represented Tafida, said after the hearing: ldquoThere are no winners in a case like this, but the family are relieved they are now a step closer to taking Tafida to Italy for treatment.ldquoThe court had to consider whether the hospital had a legal right to detain a child and prevent parents from transferring their child to private medical care abroad.ldquoIn the wake of strong legal arguments, the court agreed the parents should not be prevented from seeking alternative medical care abroad. A hospital in Genoa has confirmed it is willing to continue Tafidarsquos care and has the expertise to do so. The Italian hospital has confirmed that Tafida will not have her le-sustaining treatment withdrawn in her current condition under Italian law.ldquoI am pleased to have fought for a judgment from the High Court which claries a complex area of law. At the heart of this, there is still a very poorly little girl. Everyone has Tafidarsquos best interests at heart. Tafidarsquos family would like to thank the public for their support in what remains a very distressing time for the family.ldquoTafida suffers from a rare condition which causes a tangle of blood vessels with abnormal connections between the arteries and veins and suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result. She was apparently completely healthy before her injury.Ms Begum said the legal fight had been ldquoextremely traumatic. She said the family had always had Tafidarsquos best interests at heart."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-becomes-first-part-uk-ban-smacking","story":"MSPs voted by  to  to makethe physical punishment of a child a criminal offence.Scottish Green MSP John Finnie, who introduced the legislation, said it would \"send a strong message that violence is never acceptable in any setting, and that our children deserve at least the same legal protections that adults enjoy\".He said: ldquoPhysical punishment has no place in st century Scotland.\"The international evidence tells us that it can have serious impacts on children, and that it is not effective.\"As I have progressed this campaign over the last three years, it has become clear just how many people believed that striking a child was already outlawed.ldquoI am extremely proud to have brought forward the legislation that will enhance childrenrsquos rights in Scotland and believe that today we have taken a huge step toward making Scotland the best country in the world for children to grow up in.Richard Frazer, convener of the Church of Scotlandrsquos Church and Society Council, also welcomed the decision.He said: ldquoThe passage of this Bill gives children the same legal protection as adults, acknowledging that children are valuable as they are and not simply as adults in training.ldquoWe hope that the positive change marked today will enable children and families to continue to flourish and grow as equal members of our communities.ldquoHow we treat, love, nurture and discipline our children is at the heart of family le.ldquoIt undoubtedly has profound and far-reaching implications for how our children will live, behave and relate to others in society as children and as adults.ldquoNow is the time to move on from the idea that violence against children can be justied.ldquoThroughout history there have been times when, after deep and considered reflection, it has been decided that some of the behaviours once deemed acceptable in the past are deemed unacceptable.ldquoSuch shts are important as we seek to live in a way that encourages le in all its fullness and values everyone.ldquoThis is not just about a piece of legislation but it is also about a cultural sht in attitudes.ldquoWe all need help and support in bringing about this change, and it is right that such support and help will be available.ldquoThis is an important step on that journey.However, critics warned the legislation is \"imprecise\" and risks criminalising parents.Scottish Tory MSP Oliver Mundell said the legislation could ldquounnecessarily criminalise good parents and draw others needlessly into contact with the criminal justice system.He said: ldquoRather than seeking to help and support families we are pushing them towards the criminal justice system.ldquoWe say we support evidence based decisions but are happy to dispense our duty by making a criminal and moral judgement on the actions of others rather than sharing with them the best available evidence around parenting practices and trusting them to make their own decision.ldquoThese concerns about criminalisation have been dismissed throughout the passage of this Bill but the truth is no-one here can guarantee how this Bill will be implemented and interpreted by the police, prosecutors or our courts.Under current Scottish law, parents and carers are allowed to use \"reasonable\" physical force to discipline children.The Children Bill removes this defence.SNP childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd said: ldquoIrsquom very pleased that Parliament has now voted to ensure that children, without exception, have the same protection from assault as adults.ldquoIn removing an outdated provision that has no place in a modern Scotland, we are reaffirming we want this country to be the best place in the world for children to grow up so that they feel loved, safe, respected and can realise their full potential. ldquoWe will now work in partnership with organisations including childrenrsquos charities, Social Work Scotland and Police Scotland to raise awareness of the Bill and build on the existing support we offer to children and families."},{"url":null,"title":"sturgeon-savages-carlaw-conversion-no-deal-brexit","story":"The First Minister said the Eastwood MSP had changed from enthusiastic Remainer to no-deal Brexiteer in ldquoa heartbeat as he tried to become his partyrsquos full-time leader.ldquoShame on him for that, she said.Mr Carlaw, who represents one of the most Remain constituencies in the UK, has previously warned against a no-deal in case it imperilled the Union.It was a position he shared with previous Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, who quit in August citing a ldquoconflict over Brexit after Mr Johnson said he was ready for a no-deal Brexit.However at the Tory conference in Manchester this week, Mr Carlaw flipped his position and swung the Scottish Tories behind accepting no-deal, despite only being an interim leader.He said: ldquoAfter three years after an extension with everybody saying enough is enough we need to move forward. I support the PM in everything he is doing andwe canrsquot get a deal by October  - and I hope we can - itrsquos time for us to go.The sht, made without consulting all his MSPs, left some in a ldquocold fury.At FMQs, Mr Carlaw said his party was ready to support the Prime Ministerrsquos proposed deal, and asked Ms Sturgeon why her MPs were automatically opposed to it, when she said she was ready to compromise.He said: ldquoFurther dither, delay and uncertainty, and the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister, to which this First Minister is disgracefully open, is much more damaging to us all than getting this sorted now.ldquoWe are at the th hour, there is a need on all sides to compromisewe are going to reach a negotiated settlement, yet the record of this SNP Government has been to fail to do so. ldquoThe First Minister repeatedly says she will do anything possible to stop no-deal, yet despite three opportunities this year, her MPs havenrsquot ever voted for a deal.ldquoDoes she regret not ordering her MPs to vote for a deal when she had the chance The FM replied: ldquoMy alternative to no-deal is no Brexit, thatrsquos what the people of Scotland voted for. All of the efforts at compromise to keep us in the single market and customs union were spurned and cast aside by Theresa May. I will not support an option which takes us not just out of the EU, but out of the single market and customs union.She went on: ldquoJackson Carlaw has no credibility on this, or perhaps on anything  after the events of this week. Hersquos gone from being an enthusiastic Remainer to a Boris Johnson-loving, no-deal Brexiteer in what seems like a heartbeat.ldquoHe has completely abandoned the interests of the Scottish people - shame on him for that. No wonder his colleagues now want to get rid of him.Mr Carlaw said: ldquoThe real shame is a First Minister who is prepared to conspire to make Jeremy Corbyn the Prime Minister of this country.Ms Sturgeon said Mr Carlawrsquos position was ldquosimply doing whatever Boris Johnson instructs him to do.She said: ldquoHe doesnrsquot care about the best interests of the Scottish people. Irsquom not even sure he cares about the best interests of the Scottish Conservative Party, because backing no-deal is certainly not in those interests.ldquoI think Jackson Carlaw has made the miscalculation that backing Boris Johnson is the best way to remain leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, but I have to say, his colleagues seem to have a completely dferent view of that.ldquoJackson Carlaw has squandered any shred of credibility he ever had.Mr Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon was not interested in an orderly UK exit from the EU, merely a ldquoneverendum on Brexit, much like the one she pursues on independence.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard raised concerns about NHS Tayside wanting to centralise mental health services despite an independent expert recommending it should not.Mr Leonard said Dr David Strangrsquos interim report had one recommendation - no centralisation before a full review of mental health service strategy - yet the health board was proposing to ignore it.Dr Strangrsquos report was prompted by a campaign by relatives of David Ramsay, who killed himself in  after twice being turned away from the Carseview Centre in Dundee.Mr Leonard quoted Dr Strangrsquos reaction to the health boardrsquos plan: ldquoIt is disappointing. This was the only recommendation in the whole report, because I thought it was urgently needed.Mr Leonard also quoted Mr Ramsayrsquos niece, Gillian Murray, who led the campaign after his death: ldquoNHS Tayside refuse to listen, they refuse to change, they are being allowed to carry on: business as usual ... things are getting worse at NHS Tayside, not better.He asked Ms Sturgeon to intervene ldquobefore more time is wasted, before more families are made to suffer and before more lives are needlessly lost.She said: ldquoI expect health boards to properly take account of such recommendations in the decision-making processes that they are required to undertake. I will certainly consider carefully the points that Richard Leonard has made.ldquoI take the opportunity, again, to put on record my condolences to David Ramsayrsquos family and to anyone  whose loved one has lost their le to suicide.ldquoThe Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport would be very willing to meet David Ramsayrsquos family,that would be of interest, to hear at first hand their concerns about the ongoing situation at NHS Tayside.ldquoIt is important that we listen to the lived experience of patients and patientsrsquo relatives, and we will continue to do that in good faith and in all sincerity."},{"url":null,"title":"food waste really can power cars like in the 1980s back to the future movies","story":"Just as Marty McFly and the Doc discovered in Back to the Future, our food waste can be transformed into a sustainable fuel to power future energy needs.So environmental organisation Zero Waste Scotland is using this year’s Recycle Weekto raise awareness of the potential energy that can be captured by simply placing peelings, egg shells, tea bags and any uneaten produce in household food recycling caddies.The time travelling DeLorean used in the classic s movies was modied to run on food waste – and the technology now exists to use it today to power vehicles, heat our homes and grow more food.Estimates from Zero Waste Scotland reveal that , tonnes of global warming CO equivalent gas would be saved from entering the environmenteveryone in Scotland with access to a food caddy recycled their tea bags. Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

This OpenRoaming technology is being trailed in the county as part of the UK’s most ambitious testbed for connectivity in rural areas, in a project that aims demonstrate the potential and practical use cases that connectivity could bring to rural businesses.CloudNet, is enabling Orkney residents and tourists to use Cisco’s OpenRoaming services across key locations on the island including the ferries, ports, piers, distilleries and libraries. The trial is testing how handsets can provide a frictionless connected experience for residents and tourists in Orkney. G RuralFirst’s public Wi-Fi access network in Orkney is the first of its kind to support OpenRoaming in a live trial environment.OpenRoaming aims to combine the convenience of roaming with Wi-Fi connectivity. Users’ identities are authenticated once before they can access Wi-Fi without needing to login or register again. By linking access providers such as public venues, retailers, ports and offices, together with identity providers, such as carriers, devices and cloud services, OpenRoaming offers mobile users frictionless Wi-Fi onboarding.“OpenRoaming will change the way we connect to Wi-Fi and presents new opportunities for providers in a world where we expect high quality ubiquitous broadband access where ever we go,” said Dez O’Connor, Cisco and project CTO, G RuralFirst.“Customers tell us that Wi-Fi onboarding is a major pain point and there is a perception that it can be unreliable and insecure. OpenRoaming will transform the experience of using Wi-Fi into a seamless and positive one. As well as improving the connected experience for industries like tourism in Orkney, venues providing Wi-Fi to their customers will be able to use it as a means of engaging with them.”He added, “This trial shows the benefit of seamless connectivity in one of the most complex, challenging environments. It lays the foundations for many new WiFi solutions as our most innovative customers and partners join us to develop access networks and identity provider services across the UK and the rest of the world.”Around , tourists visit Orkney every year, making it a signicant contributor to the local economy. By making OpenRoaming services available to tourists, the G RuralFirst project aims to provide a fully connected experience for visitors to Orkney as well as its residents. Furthermore, Cisco say that there is a commercial opportunity for local tour operators and cruise ships through selling Wi-Fi packages which leverage OpenRoaming and augmented reality tourist applications across the island.The technology is also being used to support connected tourism by promoting Orkney Origins, an augmented reality app developed as part of G RuralFirst. The app provides digital tour guides of Orkney’s historic and picturesque sites via tourists’ smart devices, at access points. Tourists are able to download the app on the spot through OpenRoaming, rather than in advance of arriving, and be guided by digital avatars, creating a more memorable tourist experience and narrating the unique history of the Orkney Islands.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Westminster’s corrosive discussion style rewards smirk and smarm, sarcasm and grandiloquence. Ratings for the BBC Parliament channel have shot up. Many new viewers will find themselves nauseated by the baying.Bolshy tub-thumping does please a select audience. Those who rejoice in Brexit chaos and spread opportunistic lines of establishment shake-up, those who scream “traitors”, and those who require Gina Miller to have security protection.

The drawbacks of belonging in the Union are more readily demonstrable, with logic and reason increasingly thin on the ground. In this light, Sturgeon’s reputation as level-headed, intelligent, and engaged is more than ever a massive asset to persuading former No voters over the line.In , her predecessor Alex Salmond’s palpable desire to ‘win’ a point, and the relish with which he appeared to be playing the game, was satisfying for those who already agreed with him and deeply irritating for those who didn’t. Some of those developing in Salmond’s mould have more than a little hint of that egotistical hubris, and it is unlikely to do the movement favours in the long run.No-ingJoanna Cherry’s excellent contribution to legal challenges to prorogation of Parliament has both shown her strengths as a QC and boosted her UK-wide profile. There’s ato the Court of Session in Edinburgh tomorrow in an attempt to compel Johnson to seek an extension to article , should no deal be agreed before  October. It could be another remarkable moment. This kind of expertise is also in stark contrast to Johnson’s circus antics and the last few years of rationality and common sense in Westminster being wilfully eroded and derided.So it seems self-defeating, but not entirely surprising, that Cherry is billed as speaking at Saturday’s All Under One Banner rally straight after her legal triumph. The bill also includes Tommy Sheridan, notoriously convicted of perjury and who has been promoting the event on Sputnik TV. SNP women politicians and campaign group Women For Independence have spoken on several occasions about refusing to share a stage with Sheridan following the acrimonious row with a group of women in the now-split Scottish Socialist Party. We know dissuaded women voters are an important target group for the campaign.: Boris Johnson warns Brexit delay will trigger  chaos and indyref: Why it’s wrong for SNP to talk about sending me ‘homeward’ – Luke Graham MPNo matter where you stand on the logistics of no-ing, and certainly Cherry has the right to speak alongside whomever she chooses, the biggest names repeatedly appearing on these line-ups hark back to both unsavoury episodes in Scottish politics and yesterday’s has-beens, and anchors the argument with glaring lack of credibility. Responding to these events is a tricky balance for independence parties, who can’t really ignore the many decent people who have the right to demonstrate support for independence by marching and who are bolstered by having a comradely day out, but ultimately, they’ve already been won. The campaign needs to win over the more sceptical, who are likely alienated by such displays.Also speaking at the event is Cherry’s frequent cheerleader, Chris McEleny, who has similarly engaged with wedge issues like the Gender Recognition Act while remaining reticent on abortion rights, as I wrote about back in May. Transpeople and women deeply deserve consensus and a way forward rather than a fanning of ision, and everyone deserves politics demonstrating common sense right now. As clueless as it getsOne day after celebrating Cherry’s success at the Supreme Court, McEleny replied to the tweet: “Question to all Scottish independence supporters slavering over Lady Hale. Would you be willing to break ‘the rule of law’ to achieve independence ” with the answer “Gandhi, Mandela, Dr King, Rosa Parks, Bruce, Wallace... all broke the law of the time.” With the threat of Johnson aiming to undermine the crucial judicial win, this is as clueless as it gets.Angus MacNeil, the Tweedledum to McEleny’s Tweedledee, has joined him in campaigning to push ahead with independence through a Section  order. A loud, obnoxious, and not particularly bright contingent has been banging drums of discontent for some time, praising ex-leader Salmond and disparaging Sturgeon’s slow and steady leadership style. The outcome of these combined interests will undoubtedly win them some personal fans from the party fringes, and sow a few seeds of dissatisfaction with current leadership who rightly demonstrate resistance to recklessness at this crucial moment. But in its petulance, impatience, and willingness to court minority interests to dent the more widespread appeal that the leadership has, it is the exact opposite of what the Yes campaign now requires.The landscape has been fundamentally changed. The Yes campaign needs only gesture in the direction of the calamity that has ensued to show how promises by the No campaign have been turned on their head or shown to be hollow. The focus now must be, very specically, on the voters who opposed independence in  but who are horried at Brexit and rampant populism, and to present a sensible and credible alternative, argued strongly but calmly, looking secure and in control. This is exactly Sturgeon’s lane, and it’s exactly the opposite of taking a microphone after Sheridan has shouted into it.People are so tired of populists. They’re tired of those who sow ision, of reckless grandstanding, and of politics being spat out with fury rather than calmly negotiated. They’re tired of blunt stupidity. They’re tired of flags. Scottish voters who desire to remain in the EU are aghast at what has transpired and they don’t want more in the vein of self-serving, table-thumping bombast.

That will certainly catch Mr Trumprsquos attention and make clear that this attack on the Scottish economy, over a dispute which has nothing to do with us, is not acceptable.US tarfsThe tarfs are set to be imposed by the US after the World Trade Organisation ruled in May that Europe illegally subsidised planemaker Airbus, which hurt its American competitor Boeing.The ruling gives the Trump administration the legal right to impose counter-measures on the EU in the form of tarfs, and products targeted include wine, cheese and olives, which are produced in many countries involved in the Airbus consortium. Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods, but the EU has said it hopes not have to resort to that. In Scotland, other goods which would be affected include cashmere, cheese and seafood.A Number  spokesman said that the UK government was \"disappointed\" the US had resorted to tarfs, which were \"not in anyones interests. The UK is working closely with the US and the EU to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing dispute, and to avoid these tarfs from coming into force.\"The UK, through the EU, is seeking confirmation from the WTO that we have complied fully with their rulings regarding support to Airbus and should not be subject to tarfs.\"The spokesman added that despite the tarfs affecting Scotch whisky but not Irish whisky, the dispute had \"nothing to do with trade discussions\" with the US after Brexit.However a spokesman for the First Minister said that the tarfs \"undermined the UK government argument that one way to offset the challenge of Brexit would be a very quick, comprehensive, trade deal with the US, its clear the US isnt in a mood to exempt the UK or Scotland from these tarfs.He added: \"This is the hard reality that the US plays hardball on these issues and is not prepared to exclude the UK because of whats been said between Trump and Johnson. The suggestion of a free trade agreement post-Brexit is pretty fatally undermined by whats happened today.\"£bn export marketThe value of Scottish whisky exports to the US has grown from £m in  to over £bn last year, with a third of last years exports being single malts with a value of £ million. The US market accounts for . per cent of global volumes of Scotch whisky exports, with  million bottles of whisky exported to America in .Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said the tarfs were \"a serious situation for the industry\". She added: \"We heard overnight that a  per cent import tarf will be imposed on all single malts into the United States and also all Scotch whisky liqueurs, and thats from a position of zero.\"Weve had a zero tarf on imports to the United States for the past  years, so this is quite a hike.\"She added: ldquoThe tarf will undoubtedly damage the Scotch whisky sector. The US is our largest and most valuable single market, and the tarf will put our competitiveness and Scotch whiskyrsquos market share at risk. \"We are also concerned that it will disproportionately impact smaller producers. We expect to see a negative impact on investment and job creation in Scotland, and longer term impacts on productivity and growth across the industry and our supply chain.We believe the tarf will also have a cumulative impact on consumer choice.\"We believe it is imperative that the EU and US now take urgent action to de-escalate the trade disputes that have given rise to these tarfs, to ensure that these latest tarfs are not implemented on October , and to ensure that other tarfs ndash including on the export of American whiskey to the EU ndash are removed quickly. In particular, the UK government must now work with both sides to urge a negotiated settlement and to ensure that these damaging tarfs do not take effect.Serious blowScottish Labours finance spokesperson, Rhoda Grant MSP said: ldquoThis will be a serious blow to the Scotch whisky industry. Peoplersquos jobs and living standards should not be put at risk because of a dispute between politicians.ldquoIt is no surprise Donald Trump doesnrsquot care about this. He has spent his whole le using his inherited wealth and power to exploit working people. The UK Government must do all it can to ensure the United States reverses this decision.Scottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Murdo Fraser said: ldquoThis is obviously a very serious blow to the Scotch whisky industry. We will be speaking to our colleagues in the UK Government to see what can be done to sort this out.\"Ultimately, the responsibility here lies with the EU as it stands, and they are the ones who will need to explain to the sector why this has happened. This is something that needs to be resolved as a matter of urgency.Liberal Democrat Scottish Affairs spokesperson and MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross Jamie Stone said the tarfs \"will be a bitter blow to the Scotch whisky industry and deeply damaging to peoplersquos jobs on both sides of the Atlantic.\"He added: ldquoThe EU remains the largest export region for Scottish whisky and rather than turning our back on it we need to maintain frictionless trade. Instead the Government is creating barriers with our largest export partner.ldquoThe distilleries in my constituency are already worried by the Governmentrsquos plans to pursue a hard Brexit and Trumprsquos decision adds more concerns to the future of the Scotch export market.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sought advice on sacking prime minister source claims","story":"The monarch reportedly asked aides for first time in her reign just how and when should could dismiss a PM.The Queen sought advice on the circumstances in which she could sack a prime minister ahead of Tuesday’s incendiary Supreme Court ruling, i has been told.A source claims that the monarch asked her aides for the first time for clarication on just when and how she could dismiss a prime minister who refuses to step aside.The alleged consultations reinforce suggestions that the monarch and her most senior aides had deep concerns about Boris Johnson’s decision to prorogue Parliament, even before the country’s most senior court was asked to declare the move unlawful.It was reported on Sunday that Mr Johnson phoned the Queen to personally apologise for the embarrassment caused by the crushing Supreme Court ruling that he had acted unlawfully when he advised the monarch to suspend Parliament for five weeks - advice which she was obliged to accept.: Johnson refuses to confirm he apologised to the Queen​ Constitutional crisisi has now been told that the Queen personally asked for advice on the constitutional circumstances in which she can effectively sack a prime minister.Under the rules of the British constitution the Queen can only \"advise, encourage and warn\" ministers. It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland becomes first part of uk to ban smacking of children","story":"The Scottish Government last night pledged to lead a public awareness campaign along with police and social work chiefs.Read more: Last-ditch bid to halt Scotland smacking ban as MSPs prepare to pass lawMorag Driscoll, the Law Society of ScotlandrsquosFamily Law Committee convener, said the legislation brings Scotland in line with commitments under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.Read more: Smacking ban lsquosends clear message physical punishment isnrsquot acceptablersquoBut she said: ldquoDriving meaningful behavioural change requires much more than changing the law. ldquoNow is the time to move on from the idea that violence against children can be justied.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad ","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

It is not a fight we can afford to lose.”At the weekend a major protest was held at the gates of Green Pastures Church where Wrightbus main shareholder, Jeff Wright, is lead pastor.Hundreds of ex-employees yesterday attended a redundancy clinic in Ballymena following the firms collapse. Former workers queued to fill in claim forms almost a week after the bus manufacturer crashed into administration.The Wright family, who founded the bus-making company in , said the collapse of the business was due to a big fall in demand for buses in the UK market.Meanwhile, a debate in Westminster yesterday heard calls for bus operators to be encouraged with economic assistance to buy British.DUP MP Ian Paisley pushed for the commitment after seeking assurances that potential investors in Wrightbus know what British government support looks like, in terms of research and development, soft loans or grants.Asking an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Paisley asked Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith: Could he recognise that the arms- bodies, such as Translink and First Group and other bus buyers, need to be encouraged directly with economic assistance to buy more British-made buses Could he ensure in future all bus orders go through British companies therefore supporting British jobs and British investment Mr Smith said the government is making any potential Wrightbus bidders aware of what support could be available, adding: This is a commercial process.Its been managed by an administrator and many of the actions are required to take place at a devolved level.But we will continue, and I do continue, to speak actively to all stakeholders in this issue and I am conducting meetings in the course of this week.

The yard went into administration in August following the collapse of its Norwegian parent company.InfraStrata said it will retain the  workers who are still employed.Trade union Unite says it expects people toto work as early as this week. Unite regional officer Susan Fitzgerald said the workers had “defied the cynics”.SDLP Councillor Brian Heading welcomed news that a buyer had been found.Cllr Heading spearheaded efforts to bring together a coalition of public agencies to secure the shipyard after it fell into administration.“At last the shipyard workers have some positive news. They have fought tooth and nail to defend their livelihoods but also to secure one of Belfast’s most iconic industries. They deserve immense credit for their work over the last number of months,” he said.“What’s needed now is an economic strategy for the shipyard that will allow the site to grow and prosper. We have a real opportunity to create a green energy hub on the site, forging ahead with the assembly and manufacture of cutting edge wind technology. That’s where the economy of the future is and we should be preparing for it now.“I want to pay tribute to the immense strength and resilience of the shipyard workers and their trade union representatives who made this a pressing political priority.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lamh dhearg and portglenone get ready for part three","story":"BOTH Lámh Dhearg and Portglenone will be hoping it’s third time lucky in Ballymena this eveningas they meet once again to see who will advance into Sunday’s Antrim Senior Football Championship final.Thursday’s replay at Queen’s Arena was another night of high drama as Conall Delargy kicked an equaliser deep into stoppage time to force extra-time and Casement’s thought they had got it done as they led by one in the dying seconds of the additional period, only for Ben Rice to storm through and kick another equaliser with the last act of the game and force a free-kick contest.After five kicks each, the teams were level at - so it went to sudden death with the five kickers going again and all converted, prompting Antrim chairman Ciaran McCavana to step in and offer the teams the opportunity of another game to decide it in a more orthodox manner.His decision mostly drew praise from throughout the county and it was also applauded by Lámh Dhearg manager, Mairtín Lynch, who felt McCavana did the right thing.“I thought it was terribly brave of the county board a to advocate this and they should be given great praise for what they did,” he said.“Both teams need massive respect because they#ve brought tremendous goodwill to Antrim football. Spectators got good value for their money and I think this has brought Antrim football up another level.“It was a nail-biting finish – exactly like the last one, two teams who were highly motivated and prepared.“The dference I thought tonight was that no team was prepared to concede. The character of our own team was great because we were trailing for long stages of the match and I think both teams were a bit wasteful towards the end, but the main thing coming out of this was the drama.”Portglenone boss Barry Dillon believes the GAA should look at the policy of replays going to shootoutsrequired as it places unnecessary pressure on players, especially at club level.He was full of praise for the efforts of both teams who again emptied the tank, so this evening’s second replay could come down to who has sufficiently recovered from Thursday’s exertions.“The rules say it has to be decided, but the chairman stopped in and explained his side of it, saying that boys don#t need to be put under that kind of pressure,” he said.“I wouldn#t be for frees in the first place. A game should be won on the football pitch and not by hitting frees.“If someone was to miss a free for either team in that situation, it would be a big cross to bear to miss out on a county final like that.#You couldn#t have written the way it worked out – nine-all after free-kicks and the county chairman intervenes.#It#s great to be involved in games like that, seeing boys giving their all and the two games have been amazing.#Thursday’s game came at a huge cost for Lámh Dhearg as Pearse Fitzsimons was stretchered off with a suspected cruciate knee injury.They are still awaiting confirmation on the extent of his injury, but he certainly misses out tonight.Both teams have had little time to recover ahead od this evening’s third installment of this semi-final saga, but there will be no backward step from either as they aim to join Cargin in Sunday’s final.“We just have to go back and prepare properly,” added Lynch.“We#re up for it, we#re not prepared to concede and inch and neither are they, so it will be another great game for Antrim football.”All proceeds of this evening’s game will be split between deterMND, Paul McKeever’s Cancer Focus NI and Friends of Cancer Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"residents in stand off with contractors at glassmullin green","story":"CAMPAIGNERS opposed to the development of a new sports facility at Glassmullin Green have continued to occupy the space as contractors attempted to move on site this morning.Education NI has provided £.million for the project, which would see a G pitch, car park and pavilion built for De La Salle College.Work was initially due to begin on August , with Contractors Haffey Sports Grounds leaving the site following intervention from the Friends of Glassmullin Open Green , who have campaigned to protect the green space since .FOGOG have occupied the site for the past seven weeks and have opposed today#s attempts by contractors to begin work on the development.La Salle has previously faced accusations of failing to properly engage with residents, who have described the plans as a #land grab#.

customs union, were other potential ways to resolve the border issue.He said a fth theoretical solution, Ireland re-joining the UK, was never going to happen.“There are one in five ways that this can be done, and at least four of those would be acceptable to the Irish Government, but the best one is of course a backstop or some form of backstop, and that’s what we are trying to achieve,” the Taoiseach said on a visit to Sweden.On the prospect of a united Ireland, Mr Varadkar said: “There probably isn’t a majority for that at the moment, although some opinion polls would suggest there is.”Commenting on the likelihood of the UK staying in the EU, the Taoiseach added: “All the polls since Prime Minister Johnson became prime minister suggest that’s what the British people actually want, but their political system isn’t able to give them that choice.”Later, Ireland’s deputy premier said the island of Ireland was not ready for a poll on unication.Simon Coveney warned that such a debate would create more isions at a time when the focus should be on the post-Brexit arrangements.Mr Coveney, addressing the parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee in Dublin, said it was not the time for a border poll.“But all of the isions that flow from that, and the calls for more radical change and so on in Northern Ireland, which I don’t believe we’re ready for,” he said. ”“So these are dficult times where we’re writing history at the moment for what the relationship between Britain and Ireland and the EU and the UK will look like for the next  years and we need to get it right.”He added: “Ultimately, we’ve got to make sure that we aren’t going back to a border on the island of Ireland being a political debating point again, and all that flows from that in terms of the corrosive impact on relationships and the disruption to trade, which has been such a reinforcer of normality and peace in the border region for the last two decades.“We want to work with the British Prime Minister and we’re working as part of Michel Barnier’s team.“We will do everything we can to try to get a deal In the next week or so.“But it’s got to be the right deal so that we don’t let people down and find that the border becomes the topic of debate in Ireland for the foreseeable future.”Mr Coveney added: “If we’re going to replace the backstop with something , it has to do the same job, which is to reassure border communities that they’re not going to face border infrastructure and the disruption in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit deal cannot hand dup veto over wishes of

So I think that’s the kind of thing that we need to explore with our British friends.”Mr Varadkar was asked whether a reform of the petition of concern mechanism at Stormont could pave the way to a resolution.“I think all these things have to be discussed, but probably best not discussed in the forum of a press conference without having the other players here,” he said.After talks with Swedish prime minister Stefan Lofven in Stockholm, Mr Varadkar said he could not fully understand how the UK envisages Northern Ireland and Ireland operating under dferent customs regimes, without the need for customs posts.Mr Varadkar said he was reassured by Mr Johnson’s comments that there would be no new customs infrastructure installed, but he said that pledge appeared to contradict the text of the UK plan, which indicated checks could be carried out at unspecied designated locations.He said there was a need to “tease out” the detail of the Prime Minister’s customs proposals.Mr Varadkar said the operation of two dferent custom zones on the island would create a “real dficulty”.“Our objective is very clear, we don’t want to see any customs posts between north and south, nor do we want to see any tarfs or restrictions on trade between north and south,” he said.“They were all abolished in the s and we don’t want to go back to that.“The majority of the people in the north don’t, and the majority of the people in the Republic of Ireland don’t.“Butwe are going to be in two dferent customs unions I think that’s going to create a real dficulty, that’s going to be very hard to reconcile.”Mr Varadkar said there were five ways to avoid a hard border – the reunication of Ireland the Irish Republic re-joining the UK the UK remaining in the single market or customs union the border backstop mechanism or the UK reversing the Brexit decision.“There are one in five ways that this can be done, and at least four of those would be acceptable to the Irish government, but the best one is of course a backstop or some form of backstop, and that’s what we are trying to achieve,” he said.On the prospect of the UK staying in the EU, the Taoiseach said: “All the polls since Prime Minister Johnson became prime minister suggest that’s what the British people actually want, but their political system isn’t able to give them that choice.”Mr Varadkar said the new economic investment package for Northern Ireland proposed by Mr Johnson as part of his plan was a positive development.We cannot support any proposal that essentially suggests that a minority can determine what the majority have to live with, its just not going to workSimon CoveneyHis remarks in Sweden echoed the comments of deputy premier Simon Coveney in Dublin earlier on Thursday.Mr Coveney said that, while the plan tabled by the Prime Minister did not provide the basis for a final agreement with the EU, it did represent “progress” and could potentially be a “stepping stone” towards a resolution.Addressing the Dail parliament, Mr Coveney said: “We cannot support any proposal that essentially suggests that a minority can determine what the majority have to live with, it’s just not going to work.“Andthat is the proposal, I believe it would be very, very dficult to get an Executive up and running.“Why would other parties buy into an Executivethey believe that Executive could essentially prevent solutions linked to Brexit ”Mr Coveney also said the proposal for Northern Ireland to operate under a dferent customs regime from Ireland presented “legal and technical” problems.The Tanaiste said he believed Mr Johnson wants a deal, but he said people have a right to be sceptical, suggesting Ireland has not been treated well by the UK to date.“Ireland has not been treated well at dferent periods during these negotiations, because the policy and the proposals and the approach of the UK has shted towards Ireland at dferent times,” he said.“But, that being said, we need to work with the negotiating team that is there in front of us, that’s what we are doing.“There is a serious proposal now on the table, it won’t be the basis of final agreement but I hope it can be a stepping stone in that direction.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dup leader criticises dublins rejection of uks latest brexit plan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

We will not buy that.”Ms Foster added: “The Irish Government’s preparedness to dump the consent principle for their country’s expediency is foolish in the extreme and sends a very clear message to unionists.“From our  manesto to paragraph  of the December  Joint Report, the consent of the people of Northern Ireland for specic solutions has been key.“It is at the heart of the Belfast and St Andrews Agreements, yet the Irish foreign minister is now railing against it because it doesn’t suit his agenda.“There will be noto the flawed backstop.

The median age is under . Its a wonderful thing to see a new generation rise up and the first in my letime that % of marchers were women.\"I would put all my trust in the young women of Ireland to make a dference. I dont mean to be patronising but they are leaders of the future.\"Campaigns can rise and fall when the excitement passes but it is of the utmost importance that we stay on the same track because together we will save the climate, and world, for another generation.\"On Friday school pupils throughout the North of Ireland joined with millions of people around the world in staging protests.Some primary school classes, accompanied by their teachers, could be seen making their way to the city centre with placards carrying environmental messages.The iconic Free Derry Wall bore a stark message throughout the week. It read: “YOU ARE NOW ENTERING EXTINCTION ”, and encouraged people to join the environmental movement.By Saturday that message had been defaced by someone who scrawled \"globalist agenda\" underneath.The catalyst for the environmental movement is fteen-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg. Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable. This team has never put back-to-back championships and then all you have from everyone is that they are one-hit wonders, theyrsquoll get a championship this year, but sure next year itrsquoll not happen, he said.ldquoThey havenrsquot the heart for it, but they showed the heart they have.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC. To date  UDR recruits have completed a four-week course at the camp.HORSE RACING mdash More than  entries have been received for the Ulster Cesarewich meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse on Saturday.The card produces another bumper programme, following on the heels of the successful August Bank meeting, and the entries have been split over six dferent races.The meeting again has had to depend on sponsorship, as the Downpatrick course continues to do what isnrsquot done anywhere  in the racing world mdash carry on racing without government support.Major William Brownlow, in his annual report recently, said that he was confident that racing would continue at Downpatrick mdash the second oldest course in Ireland mdash for at least another few years.

With the leadership in the team it leaves me in no doubt they will give %, as always.Club PRO and coaching officer Gerard Lenaghan is also looking forward to Sundayrsquos showdown.ldquoI would like thank our management team and the players, especially for their dedication over the past nine months as we look forward to the final on Sunday with great anticipation, he said.ldquoThe squad has a good balance of experience and youth with an abundance of talent at their disposal. It would be remiss of me not to mention also our vibrant and hard-working executive committee who have taken a lot of the pressure off some of our footballers involved at committee level in the week to week running of the club.ldquoThe league success and now a first ever championship final is fitting reward for all our combined efforts both on and off the field. Tada gan iarracht is our club motto mdash nothing without effort, he aded.Bright chairman Marty Ranaghan, who played in several previous finals for the club, is convinced this is their year.ldquoFor many people number seven is a lucky number and hopefully this is our lucky seventh final. We are always the bridesmaid, never the bride. Not this time. We are walking up the aisle married to the cup, he enthused.ldquoFrom the start of the year the team have worked hard to get to where they are. I think the two best teams in the league are in the final and truly deserve to be there for their performances throughout the year.Team skipper OrsquoConnor canrsquot wait for the action to start.ldquoAs a local man born and reared in Killough, I know how important a win on Sunday will be for the Parish of Bright and canrsquot wait to get going, he beamed.ldquoUnfortunately, we narrowly lost out on winning the league and being promoted by only one point, but we can make amends for all that on Sunday.ldquoI am looking forward to seeing all the yellow and green flags on Sunday.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station. The extent and nature of this work will largely dictate the timeframe going forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/2nd October 2019 Speeders.jpg","title":"Speeders ‘to face pupils in school trial’  ","story":"DRIVERS caught speeding past local primary schools could soon find themselves in front of pupils who will decide their punishment at a kidsrsquo court.As part of a radical new initiative being proposed by the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership, drivers caught speeding outside a school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special court where the judges are children.Motorists who do not want to participate in the initiative will have to pay a speeding fine and accept penalty points on their driving licences.The idea of kidsrsquo courts started in England and now is being trialled in Northern Ireland. After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/ource srcset=/resources/images/10425473.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If the EU wants to insist on border check points on the island of Ireland that is a matter for them. There will be no internal UK border in the Irish Sea.”For the DUP to maintain that these new proposals are compatible with their previousstatements is to take the wider unionist community for fools. The facts are very clear. Northern Ireland would stay in the single market for goods, in an all-island regulatory zone. There would be additional checks for goods travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which is clearly a breach of the UK’s internal single market.I have no idea what threats have been made or promises offered to persuade the DUP to accept these proposals, but I am very clear that they represent a complete abandonment of the DUP’s previous position that there should be no border in the Irish Sea. I am shocked that anybody describing themselves as a unionist would be not simply accepting but advocating a border up the Irish Sea. I do not know how any unionist can possibly stand in front of the electorate and say that. It is an outrage, and people need to think very carefully where we are going with all of this.If the NI assembly will have a role in whether or not to accept EU regulations, it will certainly not be a veto — there may be some form of consultation. But, lest some will claim that there will be an effective unionist veto over accepting EU regulations for a limited time period, may I point out thata decision of the assembly is needed to agree to that, then Sinn Fein and other nationalists will have a veto over whether or not we can get out of that regulatory regime when any time period would be agreed with Brussels. Is this what the DUP’s Brexit campaign was all about  I do not think they ever saw Northern Ireland being in such a constitutional mess. They have not thought things through.\"  \"  N.I. takeaway owner caught employing illegal immigrant - court orders her to pay back more than £, in criminal profits Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"These proposals are dangerous they clearly weaken Northern Ireland’s position as a full and equal member of the United Kingdom and regardless of whatever is going on with the DUP, the Ulster Unionist Party has no hesitation in saying so.Lord Empey, Ulster Unionist Peer, House of Lordstry catch  TrendingIts official -

Agri-food goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would do so via a Border Inspection Post or Designated Point of Entry as required by EU law, building on the provisions that already exist to support the SEU. They would be subject to identity and documentary checks and physical examination by UK authorities as required by the relevant EU rules.says that:“Northern Ireland would also align with all relevant EU rules relating to the placing on the market of manufactured goods. This would reinforce the arrangements above by ensuring that regulatory checks can be implemented at the boundary of the zone, as appropriate and in line with relevant EU law, minimising the potential for non-compliance.The official UK government position articulated in this document therefore makes it clear that all goods coming into Northern Ireland will have to do so via border inspection posts.No regulatory border with the Republic, but one with Great Britain! Leaving Northern Ireland alone in the EU’s single market like this is totally unacceptable and it is staggering that any unionist would even countenance such proposals for a moment.\"  \"  Northern Ireland abortion law a breach of human rights commitments rules Belfast courtMan charged with string of offences after trying to sell stolen tools at Milton Keynes cash converter store Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Northern Ireland would remain subject to EU law, not British law, when it comes to the single market.

Does anyone seriously believe that nationalists will not use this as a pretext to argue that we would be better off with MEPs in a united Ireland We would remain under the European Court of Justice on all single market issues.While paragraph  commits the government to guaranteeing Northern Irish businesses and farmers continued unfettered access to the rest of the UK market it does not say that in reverse. In fact, it expressly says the opposite. Goods and services will be able to flow unhindered from Northern Ireland to Great Britain,but when they come from Great Britain to Northern Ireland they will be subject to checks — a key flaw in Mrs May’s proposals therefore remains.Under these proposals Great Britain can and will erge from EU single market rules, creating increasing severance with the rest of the UK.Evenone puts aside the very serious constitutional ramications of agreeing to these proposals, economically they make no sense.NISRA publish data annually as part of their Northern Ireland Broad Economy Sales and Exports Statistics.Its analysis of purchases and imports from trade partners split by goods and services for  showed that • The total purchases from Great Britain in goods was £, million while the purchases of services from Great Britain was £, million. • The total imports from the Republic of Ireland in goods was £, million while the purchases of services from the Republic was £ million. In fact, the total purchases in goods from Great Britaindwarfed the total purchases in goods from the Republic and the rest of the EU combined . So, for sake of easy access for £, million of goods from the Republic these proposalsfetter £, million goods from Great Britain — the very goods that stock our supermarket shelves and are part of the vital supply chain to our industry.Doubtless we will be told that these proposals are improvement on those put forward by Mrs May because it gives the Northern Ireland Assembly a say. But let’s consider that.Paragraphs  and  say that the Assembly and Executive must give their consent on an on going basis “before the end of the transition period, and every four years afterwards”. This is a recipe for instability, not stability.This plan creates a new crisis date —  — which you can see becoming the focus for Sinn Fein’s campaign for a unity referendum. It also gives them all the time they need to talk up the supposed clf edge and a new project fear focused around that date.At best it is very easy to see how  will see Brexit become the key feature of crisis Stormont talks.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

They must know that there are real-world consequences from dangerous language.I have many friends who took a respectful and dferent view from me on Brexit. Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.
