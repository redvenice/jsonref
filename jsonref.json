The ageing fleet, with a large influx of solar and wind power and a fractured climate policy framework, has presented the electricity market with a major headache.State, territory and federal ministers will this year consider reforms proposed by the ESB to ensure the exit of coal-fired power plants occurs in an orderly manner. Experts say the national electricity market needs to be “fit for purpose” for a future in which power generation is more decentralised and rooftop solar even more prevalent.But in an accompanying paper on the health of the national electricity market, the ESB said the transition “would be less difficult if there was an agreed national emissions reduction trajectory” among the nation’s energy ministers.Asked whether she would support the federal government endorsing net zero by 2050 so that everyone was on the same page, Schott said: “Yes, I would.”Schott added: “But it’s interesting, isn’t it? Because I think the federal government’s under international pressure about its emissions target overall, not just the electricity sector … They’re softening their language and clearly, you know, moving in that direction without actually saying so.”The Morrison government says it is committed to net zero in the second half of the century, and while it has never explicitly ruled out a 2050 target, it has argued it won’t do so without spelling out the costs.Political pressure has mounted as an increasing number of Australia’s trading partners including Japan, South Korea and the European Union, have embraced the goal, while China has set 2060 as its goal.After the US presidential election – when Joe Biden prevailed with a platform that included returning the country to the Paris agreement and setting the nation on a course to net zero by 2050, Scott Morrison said he aspired to get there “as quickly as possible”. The prime minister was rebuffed from speaking at a recent climate ambition summit.The ESB paper notes all of the states and territories in the national electricity market have backed net zero by 2050.“What is not agreed among these jurisdictions is the trajectory to reach their targets and as each state and territory pursues its own target out to 2030 and beyond to 2050, governance of NEM operations is an ongoing challenge,” the report says.Schott said the states were “all going at different speeds” but needed “to recognise that the policies that they’re doing on their own are actually having an impact across the whole national electricity market”.She said NSW’s electricity infrastructure roadmap was relatively recent, but Victoria and Queensland “have been going flat out on renewables” and that had an impact on neighbouring states. Schott called for better coordination among the jurisdictions.Schott also said investors in large-scale renewable energy needed confidence that they would not “spend a few hundred million putting in a generator and then you find you can’t dispatch your power because the grid is congested”.The ESB report spells out priorities for post-2025 reforms, including ensuring reliable supply during the energy transition, better managing demand, and ensuring renewables link in with the network.Schott was upbeat about the opportunities the transition offered to ordinary energy consumers, saying the uptake of rooftop solar was spawning a decentralisation of power generation.“Consumers have always been rather inert in that they take the power and pay the bill, and that’s sort of the end of it,” she said.“But these days with rooftop solar, a lot of people are putting in batteries. A lot of people will be buying electric vehicles. That means that people will be storing power and they can also, of course, export it. So consumers are going to have the opportunity to have sort of smart little energy systems in their homes.”The board’s accompanying report on the health of the national electricity market charts progress against the strategic energy plan agreed at the Council of Australian Governments in 2019.That plan was designed to make sure energy stayed affordable, reliable and secure as coal plants closed and more renewables came on line.“Progress is being made and the outlook is improved on previous years,” the report said.The biggest concern was still maintaining the supply of electricity in a market with more variable renewable generation. The ageing coal fleet was also becoming less reliable, the report said.The Covid-19 pandemic had also created affordability issues for consumers. Renewable generation had driven lower prices, the report said, but a failure to deliver a “smooth transition” could see prices go up again.The federal energy minister, Angus Taylor, said the nation needed “a coordinated approach to market design to keep the lights on and costs down”.“The NEM needs to adapt to address risks to reliability, security and affordability, particularly sudden, unexpected exits of thermal generators,” Taylor said in a statement.“We need long-term signals for private sector investment in reliable generation and storage, to replace exiting generators with like for like capacity.”The ESB paper rules out a Grattan Institute proposal requiring coal-fired plants to nominate their own closure timeframes and then make ongoing payments to the energy market operator, which are held so that compliance can be enforced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a499ef117dbf21f7bd6c393b7ae637120fdd99a/0_0_5534_3323/master/5534.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7afecff924f9594afbd412bb0469686b","title":"ftse 100 covid vaccine stock markets europe","story":"Hopes of swift economic rebound give way as country heads for tighter restrictionsThe FTSE 100 rose strongly on the first trading day of 2021, although optimism over the newly approved Oxford coronavirus vaccine was tempered by the prospect of tougher lockdown restrictions.Analysts said a lack of widespread disruption for cross-border trade after the end of the Brexit transition had also buoyed markets. Truck movements are, however, below normal for the time of year, after firms rushed to move goods before the transition expired and a last-minute deal was agreed between the UK and the EU before the 31 December deadline.Tougher government restrictions and the rapid growth in coronavirus infections are however expected to hit the economy at the start of the year.

Borrowing soared to £5.7bn in November, up £1.2bn on the level in October.The number of new mortgage approvals – which provide an early indicator for borrowing levels in future months when buyers take up their mortgage offers – have increased more than tenfold, after hitting a low point of 9,400 in May.Figures from the Bank also showed households repaid £1.5bn of credit card debt, personal loans and car finance in November, in a reflection of weaker consumer spending during the second national lockdown and some households in which people work from home being able to save money.Since the start of the pandemic in March, households have repaid £17.3bn of consumer credit, according to the Bank, bucking a trend in recent years for rapid growth in credit-card borrowing.While many low-income workers have suffered a financial hit during the pandemic, total household deposits increased by almost £5bn on the month to reach £17.6bn, as people saved money while much of the high street was closed.Despite the boom in mortgage approvals – equivalent to the last days of the mid-2000s property bubble when zero-deposit mortgages were still widely available – analysts warn that a sharp drop in activity is looming.The UK housing market boomed in 2020, with property prices soaring to a six-year high as people rushed to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday and re-evaluated their living arrangements during lockdown.Faced with the potential downturn, lenders have made it tougher for buyers with smaller deposits to purchase a home – hitting first-time buyers.Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said demanded looked set to remain strong right up until the starting threshold for paying stamp duty – the tax paid on property purchases – returns to £125,000, from £500,000 at present.“The mortgage market is heading for a hard landing,” he said.House price growth is, however, expected to return in 2022, according to analysts, despite the cost of a home rising out of reach for increasing numbers of people in recent years.Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at the estate agents Knight Frank, said: “While the end of the stamp duty holiday in March will clearly have an impact on transaction numbers, the effect will be reduced if the pandemic has entered the endgame. Some buyers and sellers may hesitate in coming weeks, but sentiment will ultimately improve over the course of the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adbd97735bb715cefae78e3b8e74a90ca5c2f48a/0_235_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c69010809f927e7d5cd20edd14edfbcb","title":"parents in england how have you been affected by the delay to schools reopening","story":"We would like to hear from parents about childcare after some local authorities closed schools the day before children were due to returnIn parts of England, parents face more uncertainty as some local authorities delayed the reopening of schools due to the rise in coronavirus cases in the country.

At its most primal, it involves deliberately releasing animals such as beavers or wolves in the belief that the re-entry of a single alpha species brings with it a cascade of ecological benefits.Either way, rewilding has come to be associated with big acreages, whether that be at Knepp Park in Sussex or at the 18,000-acre Glenfeshie estate in the Cairngorms. The perception is that it is expensive, far away and often inaccessible. It certainly isn’t something that just anyone can do.But what if the wildest places of all were right under our feet? In the forgotten spaces in our cities, rewilding has always happened naturally, , land falling under stone and resurging again, concrete lids flipped off before submerging once more. In the margins and the demilitarised zones, the abandoned embankments, the bits we don’t want or the lands already contaminated beyond human tolerance, ecology is thriving.In some places – such as the land around the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant in Ukraine – plant and insect life has adapted to the extreme conditions: boars have moved in, there is a new radiation-munching fungus and, in the thin strip of no-man’s land between the borders of North and South Korea, leopards and Asiatic black bears have been spotted. In the past century, Greenham Common in Berkshire has transformed from open heathland grazing to the home of US Trident missiles to an SSSI nature reserve with a weedy runway.In Scotland, the 40-mile strip between Glasgow and Edinburgh has always been mined, for not just coal, but stone, gravel, lead and even gold. After centuries of hard pickings, parts of Lanarkshire and Ayrshire have an upended appearance. What was underground is now on top and what was above has gone below, with buildings and bridges slumped over old drift mines and razor-lined spoil heaps terraced by extraction tracks. Wildfowl nest on lochs made from old coal holes and an orchid called Young’s helleborine, discovered in 1975, favours only the best iron ore.The Ardeer peninsula in Ayrshire is home to the unusually bracing combination of a nudist beach and an explosives factory once owned and operated by the Alfred Nobel Company. Parts of the site are still in use, but most of the 330-acre site was long ago abandoned. Along the cracks in the old pipelines and through the decaying buildings, it would be quicker to list the native plants that are no longer there than those that are.In theory, industry and mining companies are supposed to follow restoration plans for abandoned sites, but in practice they often plead poverty. Besides, ecologists sometimes find themselves ensnared in a paradox. Public feeling is that big business should be obliged to make good what it has taken, but human attempts to restore land are often amateurish. Planting a few conifers and flinging around a mix of wildflowers may be a quick fix, but sometimes it appears that the best thing to do is nothing.The M74 motorway runs up the front of Scotland past new windfarms and second world war PoW camps. Not far from Broken Cross, Europe’s largest opencast coal mine, there’s Castle Dangerous. In 1913 the 13th Earl of Home tried to lift local unemployment at Douglas by allowing mining nearby. The mining unseated the castle, it was demolished, and the flooded workings (known locally as the Black Hole) are now so patterned with commuting birdlife that it resembles an avian Heathrow.Further up the motorway, near Port Glasgow, the old timber ponds attract birds of a seaborne kind. The ponds are shallow estuarine mudflats ided by ancient wooden stakes (or stabs) and were once used to grade and store logs for shipbuilding. It is an atmospheric place, the stabs shrouded in black weed like cartoon ghouls while beyond them the lights of Dunbarton shine over the water. Poking around in the mud and sunken tyres I hear a curlew for the first time this year, its song for an instant rhyming with an ambulance siren.On the other side of the Clyde, between the Erskine Bridge and the old John Brown shipyard, lies what used to be the Beardmore naval construction works in Dalmuir. In the early 20th century it produced munitions, planes, submarines and warships before being converted into a fuel-supply depot and then being gradually abandoned.Now a cycle path runs through it, but otherwise there is nothing new here except nature: golden leaves of birch springing from the concrete jetty, hawkweed drifting Ophelia-like in the drowned oil storage tanks, wrens nesting in the rusted embankments, mallards cackling from the blackthorn scrub. “Have you seen the deer?” asks a dog walker. There are two, apparently – one red, one roe, both favouring the grazing just beneath the giant electricity pylon.Dalmuir is beautiful, dangerous – and almost certainly contaminated. Like many of the other sites, it has always been used by more than just squirrels and crows. Since industry retreated it has been a flytip, a heroin shooting gallery and probably a place to dispose of worse things than just old mattresses.Halflands like these can be among the most joyous and optimistic places on earth, but they can also carry with them a polluting sense of menace. Finding them means that you may end up meandering across an indeterminate line between a walk in the park and full-scale urban exploration you explore at your own risk. Some places encourage public interest and others, despite Scotland’s differing access laws, discourage it.They also have a habit of vanishing. Brownfield sites tend to be classified as wasteland, and with the pressure on housing, they are first in line for redevelopment. Ardeer is intended for “regeneration” and Dalmuir will shortly be dug up to make way for the Scottish Marine Technology Park, a deepwater ship hoist and a new small-vessel fabrication yard. Malin Group, which owns the site, says it will create 600 short-term jobs and give a multimillion-pound boost to the local economy, which it claims is “sure to bring back to life this area of the river”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3034ec89ef796459a6a40c6885c70d2e2e4ce184/0_119_2750_1650/master/2750.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=881790517c407920df6c77c384516226","title":"southampton v liverpool premier league live","story":"37 mins: Indeed, in terms of genuine goal threat there has basically been nothing, apart from the goal. Salah is played through on the right and for a moment looks like he might change that, but Bertrand gets back to take the ball.34 mins: Mane works a good shooting position, but from just outside the area scoops his effort over the bar. Liverpool are yet to have a shot on target.31 mins: Tella has come on. Walcott shifts to the left in the ensuing reorganisation.31 mins: Djenepo is on the turf and looking unhappy, having gone down holding a hamstring. Nathan Tella is getting ready to come on.28 mins: Southampton just seem to have lots of players all over the pitch. Thiago lifts a pass to Robertson, who is in space on the left when the ball is played to him, and has four red shirts on him by the time it arrives.26 mins: Armstrong lifts the ball to Ings, who manages to control with his head before laying off to Djenepo, whose shot from the edge of the area prompts a routine save.24 mins: Stephens stops a Liverpool attack by wrapping an arm around Salah’s neck and keeping it there, and the referee seems entirely unbothered by this approach.22 mins: Liverpool had a strong spell after the early goal but in the last few minutes they have struggled to break through Southampton’s high press, managing a few passes in their own half before giving the ball away. 20 mins: A terrible pass from Alisson is intercepted by Walcott, but instead of passing to an unmarked Djenepo to his left he dribbles into a dead end.19 mins: Chance! Mane plays Salah through, but the Egyptian takes a heavy touch and by the time he catches up with the ball Forster is practically upon it, and the keeper gets a foot in the way. And Salah was also offside.15 mins: Robertson flicks out a foot at Armstrong. There’s little or no contact, but it looks petulant to the referee, who waves a yellow card.14 mins: A beautiful little dribble from Mane on Liverpool’s left. It doesn’t lead to anything, but it was 10 seconds of pure pleasure.13 mins: Liverpool win a corner, and Wijnaldum wins the header, but its path to goal is blocked by Stephens and Southampton clear.12 mins: Then Alexander-Arnold sends in a fine cross to the far post, and Walker-Peters es ahead of Mane to deny Liverpool a near-certain equaliser.11 mins: Salah spins nicely on the edge of the area, but then has the ball stolen off his toes.7 mins: Walcott is playing very centrally, lurking on the shoulder of Liverpool’s makeshift backline, and generally promising to cause trouble. Already Ings has only just managed to release him with a first-time ball over the top. 4 mins: Thiago, who gave away the free-kick, has now been booked.3 mins: It’s a free-kick from just beyond the centre circle, which Ward-Prowse chips over the defence for Ings to run onto, and he brilliantly lifts it first-time over Alisson and in!A lovely free-kick delivery, a lovely finish, and an instant breakthrough for Southampton!1 min: Peeeeeep! Southampton get the game started!The teams are on the pitch, and seconds away from kick-off!“Evening Simon,” writes Stephen Carr. Hello! “Ings will fancy his chances tonight but Henderson alongside Fabinho makes sense as both centre backs will need to be comfortable on the ball to cope with Southampton’s high press. Phillips showed against Newcastle that he’s not able to carry the ball or pass it to the required standard and Williams is practically glacial in his movement.” It’s strong decision-making from Klopp, who if things go wrong is much more likely to be criticised for putting Henderson in defence than he would be for picking either of his available specialist centre-backs, but is secure enough to back his judgement.Jurgen Klopp has a chat, first about the return of Thiago:Look, Southampton in a 4-4-2, really lively, aggressive, front-footed, brave, you need to play football. We are a football-playing side, that’s why we decided on the line-up. I hope he can be influential but he can’t do it on his own, there are enough good players around.And then about why he has asked Jordan henderson to play at centre-half:Experience. We need speed, we need technique, we need a lot of things that Hendo has. We need everything of him. That he didn’t play the position very often it’s true, but he played a few yards ahead of it. Together with Fabinho he played very often, just a line up front. If he makes a mistake it’s my fault, if he’s doing good stuff then credit to him.“Liverpool are starting an outfield of three forwards, four attacking midfielders, two attack-minded fullbacks, and one holding midfielder,” notes Paul Done. “Heavy metal football has returned.”Ralph Hasenhüttl has a chat with Sky, first about Fraser Forster:He developed his game massively with Andrew. All the goalkeepers made a good step forward. They are very oftne part of our sessions also. You can see he never stopped learning and now is the chance for him to play.Then about the absence of Che Adams and Oriol Romeu:Both have injury problems. I think Che everybody saw in the last game a horrible kick in the head, he had concussion. Oriol had problems with his calf in the session and it’s not wise to take a risk, it’s more important to have him in the next weeks. And finally about the prospect of facing a Fabinho-Henderson backline:Both still are fantastic footballers, and I know they are tactical on the highest level so it’s not difficult for them to defend as a centre-back, and when you see Thiago plays, it’s definitely a team with very good players in every position. You don’t see a lot of weaknesses in this team.So Southampton bring in Fraser Forster in goal, with Diallo and Armstrong also coming in while McCarthy, Romeu and Adams drop out (not just out of the team, but the entire matchday squad). Liverpool also make three changes, with Thiago, Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wijnaldum in and Jones, Milner and Phillips dropped to the bench. Jordan Henderson partners Fabinho in central defence.Team news is in, and this is how the two teams line up:The team with the sixth-best home record plays the side with the 11th-best away results: this should be pretty one-sided. But Southampton are without goalkeeper Alex McCarthy after a positive Covid test, Danny Ings has only scored once in the last two months and Che Adams is, according to Ralph Hasenhuttl, “a little bit tired I think at the moment”. Meanwhile Liverpool might be able to call on Thiago for what would be just a second start this season. “We will see,” said Jürgen Klopp. “He has a chance.

More regions followed within days.Then three days before Christmas, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested evidence showed infections would soar if schools were allowed to open as normal.Yet allies of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, briefed hard that he was mounting a counterattack to stop schools from closing, before Johnson yet again bowed to the inevitable last week and ordered classrooms in high-risk areas to shut to most pupils.Conservative MPs are united in their deep frustration at the chaos – but are split on its root cause.Many blame the government’s communications’ strategy, which has never fully recovered since cabinet ministers were ordered to defend Dominic Cummings as a model father after he was accused of flouting lockdown rules. Others point to the birth of the “stay alert” slogan in May as the moment where public compliance began to give way to ridicule.But communications chaos alone does not explain the flip-flopping and about-turns when it comes to policy and strategy, critics say. Often the sequence goes: news of government scientific advisers’ grave warnings leak, ministers sombrely opine on the need to act – and there follows a days-long vacuum of information set against a backdrop of growing and increasingly urgent calls for action.Last week there were stark and repeated warnings about growing pressure on the NHS, as cases surpassed 50,000 day after day. On Sunday the prime minister said there was “no question” England would need tougher Covid lockdown rules soon, echoed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, on Monday morning. It took 36 hours for the next steps to become clear. But in that vacuum, there is no transparent strategy for how action is decided.Though the UK is in a bleak situation, some MPs who blame communications say the government’s strategy and policy have not differed hugely from other countries that have also found themselves in deep difficulties.Government communications has been beset by leaks in addition to strategic decisions to hand key announcements to certain papers or broadcasters, meaning public information filters out in the strangest of ways.Several MPs pointed to the near-farcical news of the new tier 4 and the cancellation of Christmas for many – which emerged via tweets from the Sunday Times deputy political editor, Caroline Wheeler, who got the leak. However, the journalist was locked out of her Twitter account and used a new account – meaning reporters, MPs and the public were initially unsure whether the news had been faked.Government advisers will privately say that delayed decision-making and a rapidly changing situation with the new variant of the virus are to blame rather than any communications strategy.Andrew Mitchell, a veteran Tory MP who has not been afraid in the past to criticise the government, says the government is dealing as best as it practically can. “The truth is that it is the new variant of the virus that has driven a horse and cart through policy,” he said. “I have great sympathy with the government in trying to take very tough but essential decisions.”Yet there are gaps in the strategy that continue to baffle many MPs from all sides – including arrivals into the UK where travellers do not even routinely have their temperature checked, let alone are required to show a negative Covid test result.A number of normally loyal Conservative MPs have broken ranks in the past few days to call out the delay and indecisiveness, implicitly a criticism of ministers and Johnson himself.The other call came from Jeremy Hunt, the former cabinet minister and now chair of the health select committee who normally restricts his campaigning to mass testing, but who joined the clamour for a change of strategy on Monday. “We need to close schools, borders, and ban all household mixing RIGHT AWAY,” he tweeted.Once again, the path for the government seems inevitable, but MPs are beginning to wonder if it is the fault of the communications or ministers themselves as to why they keep repeatedly falling into the same missteps."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72d624dda7370b9988f32f0bfa93dc10824ff589/130_74_2719_1631/master/2719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1247088a1f94992bff89f899694bd6fd","title":"no 10 resists pressure to step up england covid 19 lockdown","story":"Boris Johnson to make TV announcement on Monday night after pressure to tackle soaring infection rate The government is expected to announce new steps to control the spread of coronavirus, as the chief medical officers recommended that the UK move to the highest coronavirus alert level.Boris Johnson is due to make a TV address on Monday evening where he is set to announce mass school closures and tight lockdown restrictions. MPs will be recalled to parliament from Wednesday.In a joint statement, the UK’s four chief medical officers said the alert level should be moved to the maximum of five, warning that without action there was a risk of the NHS “in several areas” being overwhelmed.They said: “Cases are rising almost everywhere, in much of the country driven by the new more transmissible variant. We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days.”The news came amid soaring infection numbers and hospital admissions, many linked to a new, more easily transmissible variant of the virus.A Downing Street spokesman said: “The spread of the new variant of Covid-19 has led to rapidly escalating case numbers across the country. The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives. He will set those out this evening.”Johnson was to update the country on the next steps at 8pm on Monday. The Commons, which had been put into an extended Christmas recess until next week, will return on Wednesday.Speaking to reporters earlier on Monday, the prime minister said there was “no question” England would need tough rules, but gave no timetable.It remains unclear what fresh measures could be introduced, but one option was expected to be moving areas under tier 3 rules into tier 4.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said a national lockdown “in the spirit of March” was needed, with schools closed. He said the government also needed to spell out clearly its plan to defeat the virus through vaccination with a goal of 4m vaccines a week by February.“The virus is out of control. The tier system clearly isn’t working and we all know tougher measures are necessary,” he said.“If we are asking the British people to be subject to tough national restrictions – and we are, because that needs to happen straight away – then the contract needs to be that the vaccine programme is rolled out as quickly as possible, 2m a week in January and double that in February. That needs to be the deal.“It needs to be back to the spirit of March. Now you see lots of people out and about, trains that are half full. We need very strong messaging about staying at home.” Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, who chairs the Commons health committee, had urged immediate action, saying moves to close schools and ban all household mixing must happen “right away”.“I know all these things will be under consideration with decisions potentially imminent,” Hunt tweeted. “My point is, in the face of exponential growth, even waiting an extra day causes many avoidable deaths, so these plans must now be urgently accelerated.”The new measures would need to be in place for only about 12 weeks, until enough people had been vaccinated against coronavirus, Hunt said, adding: “So there is light at the end of the tunnel.”He wrote: “To those arguing winter is always like this in the NHS: you are wrong. I faced four serious winter crises as health sec and the situation now is off-the-scale worse than any of those.“It’s true that we often had to cancel elective care in Jan to protect emergency care, but that too is under severe pressure, with record trolley waits for the very sickest patients. Even more worryingly, fewer heart attack patients appear to be presenting in ICUs, perhaps because they are not dialling 999 when they need to.”An inundated NHS could also mean more potentially avoidable cancer deaths as people stayed away from hospitals and GPs, Hunt said: “The No 1 lesson is countries that act early and decisively save lives and get their economies back to normal faster.“We therefore cannot afford to wait: all schools should be closed, international travel stopped, household mixing limited and the tier system reviewed so that the highest tier really does bring down infection levels (as with the first lockdown).”It was, Hunt added, “our moral duty” to ensure that frontline NHS staff were the first to receive the Covid vaccines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d82e7aa80636c3cd5f58a3a2bcc5bc69c2bb8919/0_247_7625_4577/master/7625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9c2d21b4866d84e37a6b2fc6afae8b9","title":"uk coronavirus live matt hancock south african covid variant lockdown schools latest updates","story":"Latest updates: Boris Johnson says all schools in England must close UK sees new record high of 58,784 cases and 407 deathsThe Labour leader supports the lockdown and is calling for support for parents and children, says the LabourList editor. Yesterday, Starmer called for Johnson to introduce national measures “within 24 hours”.The leader of the Lib Dems has criticised Johnson for “ducking the difficult decisions” and “acting too late”.Lib Dem leader Ed Davey said in a statement:“This is the public health policy the prime minister should have announced before Christmas, but yet again, Boris Johnson ducked the difficult decisions, failed to listen to experts and acted too late.“Just yesterday morning Johnson was telling parents that schools were safe and children should definitely go. Today he is telling us that they must all move to remote learning but without any proper future plan.Davey said Johnson’s “failure to act earlier means we are seeing record numbers of new infections, a rising death rate, hospitals overwhelmed and NHS and care staff exhausted”.He called for the government to set out an economic plan for businesses and the self-employed, as well as plans to increase carer’s allowance.Davey added: “All around the world, the evidence is that acting early is critical to minimising damage to the economy and protecting public health.

Just yesterday, the prime minister said “there is no doubt in my mind that schools are safe” and advised parents to send their children in.“With every jab that goes into our arms we’re tilting the odds away from Covid and in favour of the British people,” Johnson says. He says the end is in sight, and we know “exactly how we will get there.”That’s the end of Johnson’s address. He’s just tweeted this: “Now more than ever” it is vital to follow the rules, Johnson says. He adds that they will become law in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and parliament will meet remotely later that day.If we give these four groups the first dose, we will have removed huge numbers of people from the path of virus, Johnson says.If our understanding of the virus doesn’t change, the vaccine rollout continues to be successful, if deaths fall, and everyone “plays their part following rules”, Johnson says he hopes we can move out of lockdown from mid-February. Then regions will start to “cautiously” move down the tiers.The pace of vaccination is accelerating with new AstraZeneca vaccine rolled out today, Johnson says. From the middle of February, “if things go well”, Johnson says the government expects to have offered the first dose to everyone in the four top priority categories.Johnson says the problem is not that schools are unsafe, adding that children are still unlikely to be affected by new variant, but they can “act as vectors for transmission”.Government will provide support to ensure children who receive free school meals continue to receive them, and for children who need devices to learn remotely.Education secretary will work to put alternative arrangements in place as government recognises exams will not be able to go forward as normal, Johnson says.Primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England will move to remote teaching from tomorrow - except for key workers’ children and vulnerable children.Government is advising people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to begin shielding again. People will shortly receive a letter on this.People must stay at home. Johnson says you may only leave home for limited reasons - shop for essentials, work if you cannot work from home, exercise, seek medical care, or to escape domestic abuse. England must enter national lockdown tough enough to contain this variant, Johnson says.It’s clear we need to do more together, Johnson says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3030c2f2b269f8bb9ded305e496de5cf3c8fa308/511_167_2976_1786/master/2976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=026ee2d1509d0e1af568a5d22d227496","title":"brian pinker is first to get oxfordastrazeneca covid 19 vaccine","story":"Dialysis patient Brian Pinker received jab at Oxford’s Churchill hospital on Monday morning An 82-year-old retired maintenance manager has become the first person in the world outside clinical trials to get the vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.Speaking after getting the jab at Oxford’s Churchill hospital at 7.30am, Brian Pinker, 82, said: “The vaccine means everything to me. To my mind, it’s the only way of getting back to normal life.”Pinker, who is a dialysis patient from Oxford, said he was only told on Saturday that he would be getting the jab on Monday.The government hailed the first injection outside clinical trials of the Oxford vaccine as a “pivotal moment” in the fight against the virus, but senior medics cautioned against over-optimism amid continuing alarm about record new cases.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: “This is a pivotal moment in our fight against this awful virus and I hope it provides renewed hope to everybody that the end of this pandemic is in sight.”The chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, urged the public not to get carried away. He tweeted: “Vaccines give us a route out in the medium term. The NHS is, however, under very considerable and rising pressure in the short term. We must all follow social distancing for now.”Prof Andrew Pollard, the head of the Oxford Vaccine Group who was among others who also received the shot on Monday morning, echoed this caution. “It gives us a bit of hope, but I think we’ve got some tough weeks ahead,” he said.He said that with record daily case numbers, the next few weeks would be a challenge despite the optimism provided by the distribution of Oxford’s vaccine.“This is a really critical moment. We are at the point of being overwhelmed by this disease,” he said.Boris Johnson, who watched health workers get the vaccine at London’s Royal Free hospital on Monday, has promised that tens of millions of people will be vaccinated by spring. Hancock admitted that only 530,000 doses of the vaccine were ready for use this week, but promised the distribution programme was being accelerated.Speaking to the BBC, he said: “It’s a matter of getting the vaccine as soon as it’s manufactured, and then goes through the crucial safety checks, which obviously are very important and getting it into the NHS and delivered into people’s arms.”Sam Foster, Churchill hospital’s chief nurse, who administered the first Oxford vaccine, said: “It was a huge privilege. There’s nothing more that the NHS wants to do now is to get this programme going at real scale across the NHS.”NHS England’s medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said: “The NHS’s biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs.“Throughout the pandemic their response has been phenomenal, from introducing world-leading treatments for coronavirus, which have saved patients’ lives as well as delivering the very first Covid-19 vaccines outside of a trial in a landmark moment in history, and now rolling out the new OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine, chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks.”Oxford University denied that Pollard, who is 55, had jumped the queue in getting the vaccine of the first day. It said: “In line with the JCVI’s priority list, any member of the Oxford University vaccine trials team who are frontline healthcare workers, will be eligible for vaccination. Prof Pollard had been waiting to receive a vaccination in line with this policy.”Pollard said: “It was an incredibly proud moment for me to have received the actual vaccine that the University of Oxford and the AstraZeneca teams have worked so hard to make available to the UK and the world.“As a paediatrician specialising in infections, I know how important it is that healthcare workers along with other priority groups are protected as soon as possible – a crucial role in defeating this terrible disease.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1fd5e424295699de3fcbf3e5de6e8727b658152/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a6b517ea1474cda52190f7efd4c7e8d4","title":"take time off and move office functions online 10 ways to win at the new way of working","story":"The global pandemic has transformed work in a way many employees and executives want to maintain. So what can managers do today to ensure these different working practices remain a success in future?As each day passes, we’re constantly adjusting to the realities of our “new normal”. And in the unsettled world of work, worries about health and safety are compounded by other anxieties – with companies concerned about employee wellbeing, workplace services, and business continuity. Indeed, the need for organisations to continue operating has been one of the few constants of 2020.The good news is that new practices have evolved to keep businesses up and running and to protect employees. Here are 10 strategies and measures business leaders can implement to ensure this new way of working keeps working for everyone:1. Companies need to recognise the importance of supporting employees’ mental healthBusinesses have long known the importance of financial resilience. But this year, many have learned the importance of “emotional resilience” – something that can only be achieved by being supportive of employees’ mental health. Businesses need to acknowledge that Covid-19 has affected us all – and has caused a rise in mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Business leaders need to support employees through a variety of measures, including keeping in regular contact, focusing on work-life balance, and promoting access to support services. Above all, managers need to show understanding and flexibility.2. Guard against the emergence of a two-tier workforceSome employees may be happier to come into the office more regularly, while others might prefer heeding government advice to work from home where possible. But it’s important to guard against the emergence of an inefficient two-tiered workforce, where teamwork can be hampered by feelings of resentment.After all, work isn’t a one-size-fits-all proposition. Workplaces are erse – comprising traditional offices, call centre operations, manufacturing floors, retail locations, and more.6. Be aware of burnout Unfortunately, working from home can make people even more anxious about booking time off work. Leadership needs to stress that time off is essential and encourage employees to take time away from the office – even if that office is in their kitchen. Burnout leads to decreased productivity, so it is beneficial for both employees and employers to encourage a work-life balance.7. Employees’ working hours need to be respectedFor some employees, working from home translates into working all the time. They may feel like they need to overwork themselves to prove they’re doing a good job or simply have a hard time stopping without the ritual of leaving a physical office. Managers should emphasise that work done during normal office hours is valued, and model this behaviour by working reasonable hours themselves.8. Respect your employees’ work preferencesWhile it should go without saying that staff shouldn’t be pressured into the office against government advice, there are other reasons to remain flexible about office working. Some people are high-risk for Covid-19 or may live with someone who is. No one should be made to feel that this will impact their job security or career prospects. Equally, however, some employees who don’t have homes conducive to remote work may want to get back into the office as soon as possible. By supporting each inidual’s personal preference, business leaders demonstrate the caring and respect that leads to lasting employee loyalty.9. Safety measures beyond government requirements are a good moveSince the launch of the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite, more than 550 organisations have downloaded the apps. This includes employee readiness surveys, health and safety testing, and automated contact tracing to help businesses reduce workplace transmission of Covid-19.10. Provide the digital tools that make it easy to get work doneCovid-19 accelerated the need for digital transformation for companies across the board. This was especially true as businesses scrambled to support the abrupt transition to remote work. Employees whose companies already had digital workflows and platforms in place were able to keep working far easier than those that still relied on manual, offline processes.By delivering employees the right digital experience, business leaders can increase engagement, improve productivity, and maintain business continuity. Just as importantly, by leaning into digital transformation now, companies will be better equipped to survive and thrive during the current crisis – and whatever disruptions come next.If your business has yet to adapt a digital workflow platform to support cross-functional collaboration, now is the time.However work works right now, you can do it confidently with the ServiceNow Safe Workplace suite.

Outdoor team sports will not be permitted, but professional sports, including the Premier League, may continue.Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be advised to shield as far as possible and should not go to work even if they cannot work from home, the government will advise.The lockdown is set to come into effect in law as soon as possible, with regulations laid on Tuesday and voted on by MPs on Wednesday. However, Johnson said new rules should be followed from this evening, and businesses and the public should not wait for regulations to be passed.The prime minister was advised on Monday that cases were rising rapidly in every part of the country, with the chief medical officers recommending that the UK move to the highest coronavirus alert level – five – for the first time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/093af6c7c13d4316e4abb770d39741fb018812c0/68_0_1012_607/master/1012.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a0a22db09dd427729bc26d9c593e8989","title":"netherlands refuses entry uk nationals non essential travel brexit coronavirus","story":"Thirteen people barred since Brexit because UK no longer exempt from EU Covid-related travel restrictions More than a dozen UK nationals have been refused entry to the Netherlands since 1 January because Britain is no longer exempt from Covid-related restrictions on non-essential travel from outside the EU since it left the bloc.A Dutch border force spokesman confirmed on Monday that up to 13 British citizens had been turned away at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport since Friday because their trips were not necessary and third-country coronavirus regulations now applied.The news came after British citizens living in Spain were barred from boarding flights in the UK because the airline said their pre-Brexit residency papers were declared no longer valid, while others were refused entry to Germany.There were also reports of passengers turned away from KLM flights from UK airports to the Netherlands because they did not have a negative test, their journey did not qualify as essential, or they could could not show proof of Dutch or EU residency. Only a handful of countries with low coronavirus rates are exempt from EU rules barring non-essential visitors from outside the bloc and European Economic Area. The UK was removed from the list at the end of the Brexit transition period.“They all had a negative PCR test, but they forget the basic rule that it must be a necessary trip, for example for work or due to serious personal circumstances,” gendarmerie spokesman Robert van Kapel told the NOS public broadcaster.“People from safe countries are allowed to pass, but the UK is certainly not a safe country right now,” Van Kapel said. He added that some of the travellers “only wanted to visit Amsterdam”, while one man was planning to fly from Schiphol to Spain for a skiiing holiday. “That’s just not the intention now,” Van Kapel said.EU member states agreed in October to adopt a European council proposal to allow non-essential travel from a small group of countries with lower levels of Covid infections, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea.European nationals and British citizens living in the EU can still travel from the UK to the bloc with a recent negative test and proof of residence, while EU member states can in theory override the European council recommendations should they wish to.Few have, however, meaning that as long as the restrictions remain in place, British nationals can now only enter the bloc in certain cases, mainly for urgent family reasons, study, or work – including aid workers, care workers, diplomats, healthcare professionals, military personnel and transport workers.Since the end of the Brexit transition period at midnight central European time on 31 December, passengers from Britain who have a valid reason to travel to the EU must in any case also have at least six months left on their passport.They can no longer use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes, and should be prepared to show a return ticket, provide evidence that they have enough money for your stay, and have their passport stamped.On Sunday eight Britons living in Spain were turned away from a BAIberia flight to Madrid. The airline refused to accept their green cards as proof of residence despite assurances by the British and Spanish governments that the old foreign national identification (NIE) document and the new foreign ID card (TIE) were valid.A small number of British citizens were also barred from entry into Germany. A Lufthansa spokesman said the airline was aware of a British citizen being stopped from boarding a flight in the UK after failing to prove their residence in Germany.Victoria Dobbie tweeted on Sunday that she was stopped from boarding a flight to Munich after Lufthansa rejected her rental contract, work contract and her German tax number as adequate proof of residence.Britons resident in Germany are not expected to receive new types of residence documents confirming their status for several months and Germany’s federal police have said border staff would also accept rental or work contracts as proof.There are concerns, however, that ground staff at airports are not qualified to assess the validity of documents and could demand proof residents are not legally required to present. British in Germany, a campaign group, has written to the German embassy in London to express their concern."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449688.1609787169!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools likely to remain closed next week sources say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘We do want to avoid a long-scale shutdown, but we are keeping the situation under review.’ Photograph: David SleatorThe  FileIt is now more than likely that schools will remain closed beyond January 11th due to rising Covid-19 levels, senior Government sources have told the . Some sources expect there to be at least an extra week of closure and possibly two. Most Ministers privately believe that Cabinet will decide on Wednesday to delay the reopening of schools, although officials may be asked to examine keeping certain schools open in Level 5, such as disadvantaged schools or other special schools.It is understood that there are also conversations at a senior level about whether construction should remain open or not for the rest of the Level 5 lockdown.Earlier the Teachers’ Union of Ireland has called for school reopenings to be delayed until at least January 18th. TUI general secretary, Michael Gillespie said this would allow 14 days to deremine if Level 5 measures have been effective. “To re-open too early is recklessly to tempt fate,” he added in a statement issued ahead of a meeting withe the Deparment of Education The Labour Party has written to chief medical officer Tony Holohan to request that the State’s public health team carry out an urgent risk assessment on the reopening of schools in the next 24 hours.Party leader Alan Kelly and education spokesman Aodhán Ó Ríordáin have written the letter this afternoon amid concerns at what they say are “shockingly high” Covid-19 figures.“The public would greatly benefit from understanding the analysis and projections available to Nphet on how many infections are expected by the end of the week. We are particularly concerned that without increased testing capacity and a robust tracing system it is very difficult to see how schools can reopen, as there won’t be a mechanism to track down cases as they arise. “That is why we are writing to ask you if Nphet will consider urgently carrying out a public health risk assessment in the next 24 hours on the potential reopening of primary and secondary schools on 11th January. “It is our view this is needed as quickly as possible so that families, workers and school communities will know what will happen next week and can adequately plan and prepare,” they wrote.The two Labour TDs have also called for various opening options that would allow some teaching activity to continue in schools for identified cohorts such as the children of essential workers, vulnerable pupils and exam students.Minister for Education, Norma Foley, met the Opposition education spokespeople today . The Opposition say they do not believe schools will open on Monday as planned.In what is being interpreted in political circles as a change of tone, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the situation was evolving rapidly and schools were part of an ongoing conversation in Government.A decision about school reopening would be taken by Government on Wednesday when it took advice from the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) and the decision would be based on “the most up-to-date information we have”Ministers wanted to give as much notice as possible to schools and families, he said.January 18thDamien White of the Primary Principals’ Association suggested schools should not reopen until January 18th, arguing that would allow the current surge to abate and contact tracing to be re-established. Earlier, the Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman said the Government wants to avoid a “long-scale shutdown” of schools and childcare facilities because it would not be beneficial for children, especially for those with special needs or in disadvantaged areas.Mr O’Gorman said the situation was under constant review.Mr O’Gorman said the advice from Nphet had always been that schools were safe places, and the decision to delay their reopening until January 11th was part of a sustained effort to reduce movements in the community and to halt transmission of the virus.“We do want to avoid a long-scale shutdown, but we are keeping the situation under review. If the public health guidance from Nphet changed at any stage, obviously Government policy would change.”As for the position of the educational sector on the vaccination priority list, the Minister said that if there were changes in the sector then that position would be reviewed. Level 5 restrictions had been introduced on December 24th and December 30th and it would take 10 to 14 days for their impact to be seen. Mr O’Gorman told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that the Government would do more if necessary but “we need to give the restrictions time to work”.A daily record of 4,962 Covid-19 cases was confirmed on Sunday, pushing overall infection numbers beyond the 100,000-mark.CrechesMr O’Gorman defended the Government’s plan for crèches to remain open to care for the children of essential workers. When asked if there should be a second list to prioritise health care workers, Mr O’Gorman said that a second list would confuse the situation.However, he did agree that crèches should prioritise cases where the parents could not work from home. A long shut down of schools would not be good for children, he said, but the Government would keep the situation under review.Mr Donnelly said there was more contagion and more infection than during the first coronavirus surge, but stressed the arrival of vaccinations was “the great hope”.He said 4,000 people had been vaccinated and that figure would be scaled up this week. This week a Pfizer delivery arrived two days early so there could be 35,000 vaccinations this week in 20 hospitals and 25 nursing homes. He said efforts would be made to see GPs included in early vaccinations.Meanwhile, immunologist Professor Luke O’Neill has said that he cannot envisage schools reopening next week if the number of Covid cases continues to rise.Speaking on the Pat Kenny Show on Newstalk, he acknowledged that keeping the schools closed would be a difficult decision, but said that an extended closure might be necessary if transmission “is out of control.”“Closing the schools will have all kinds of knock-on effects, so it’s a very hard one. If we get to Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and the numbers are even higher, I can’t see the schools opening, because it’s another risk,” he said.Separately, public health expert Professor Anthony Staines has warned that reported plans not to alert all close contacts of positive cases would be counterproductive.“One of the basics of public health is the more you know about the cases you’re dealing with the better,” he told Newstalk’s Breakfast Briefing.There was also the real concern that if people were not tested, they would not be “in the system” and would not be contact traced which was really important for breaking down transmission of the disease, he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"The first test is for governments to stop subsidising fossil fuel industry which knowingly contributed to global over-heatingEvery 0.1 degree matters as the world attempts to keep within 1.5-degree rise\u0026lsquo2020 is on course to be the 10th consecutive year of above-normal temperatures\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449984.1609790288!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dodds seeks urgent action to safeguard suspended deliveries from britain to north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDiane Dodds: “Significant cause for concern from both businesses and consumers.” Photograph: Jonathan PorterPressEyeThe North’s Minister for the Economy has written to the UK government calling for “urgent action” to safeguard deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland which have been suspended due to the end of the Brexit transition period. A number of retailers have suspended parcel deliveries to the North from Britain and some firms particularly in the agri-food sector – have halted sales to Northern Ireland due to concerns over additional paperwork and checks. Diane Dodds said there was “significant cause for concern from both businesses and consumers” and placed Northern Ireland in a “much worse position compared to GB consumers.” The UK government must provide “long-term solutions,” she said. Under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, which came into force at 11pm on Thursday, the North remains part of the EU single market for goods and must apply EU customs rules at its ports and airports. Customs declarations are now required for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain and agri-food products must be checked at border control posts, though some “grace periods” have been agreed to ease the transition. The UK’s Customs and Revenue has adopted a “temporary approach” on parcels until March 31st, during which only businesses receiving deliveries of goods worth £135 or more from Britain will be required to fill out a customs declaration. It is not clear what will happen from April 1st. Amazon has warned that some items may be unavailable for delivery to Northern Ireland, and some deliveries may take “slightly longer than usual” due to the additional requirements. In her letter, the Minister, Diane Dodds, said that in recent weeks “numerous GB-based retailers” had withdrawn from offering deliveries to Northern Ireland. “On regulatory issues we have seen retailers of plants, food and drink ceasing to offer products for delivery in Northern Ireland due to increased costs,” she said. Ms Dodds said the UK government must “urgently engage” with retailers and marketplaces to have deliveries to Northern Ireland reinstated, as well as “address the regulatory barriers which have caused delivery for some products to be halted.” She also said London must “put together a plan now to ensure that the end of the grace period does not cause retailers and marketplaces to withdraw from this market.” Meanwhile, the volume of freight arriving at Northern Ireland’s ports has remained low following the holiday period and stockpiling by firms before the end of the transition period. Border control posts – where products of animal and plant origin arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain are checked – have been in operation since Friday. A few lorries arriving into Belfast from Scotland were delayed because of incorrect paperwork, but the new processes will not be fully tested until normal volumes of freight resume. The Department of Agriculture said a “pragmatic” approach would be applied in the first week, with the “expectation from that point . . . that businesses must arrive at point of entry having completed all the necessary paperwork and notifications.” Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Alan BetsonDublin Port’s first working week of 2021 got off to a smooth start on Monday – due in part to the extremely low volume of traffic arriving from Holyhead.Cars and lorries arriving from the UK passed without a hitch through the European Union’s new trade border inside the port as well as the Garda checkpoint, where Covid locator forms were also required.The first Irish Ferries vessel to dock, the 2.40am Ulysses sailing from the Welsh port which arrived in Dublin at 6am, carried just 15 articulated lorries, one truck, two vans and 15 cars, together with a related number of passengers.One of the ship’s deck hands, surveying the vast empty space with capacity for 241 lorries and 1,342 cars as the ship set sail, exclaimed cheerily: “Brexit England – nothing we can do.”This may, or may not, be the explanation for the low volume making the early crossing from the UK but Holyhead port officials, and the shipping companies, expect Irish Sea volumes to increase sharply later this week and throughout January when importers, especially supermarkets, seek to replenish their stocks.However, complying with the requirements of the EUUK trade deal, in force since January 1st, can present unexpected difficulties, as Scott McCann, owner of Event Transport Ireland Limited, and Sean Carry, his transport manager, found on Sunday.Prior to Covid striking early last year, the company provided rigging for major events but, when the virus emerged and the live entertainment industry died overnight, Mr McCann’s business had to ersify fast or die as well. Now, 10 months later, the company has eight 40-foot-long articulated lorries crossing the Irish Sea daily, transporting goods for an international distribution company.With the new EUUK trade deal regulations coming into force over the weekend, Mr McCann and Mr Carry decided to stress test the system for themselves by driving a load over from England, just to see what their drivers faced.He already had Pre Boarding Notification (PBN) issued by the Irish authorities but without the companion MRN number, they would not be able to catch the early Monday morning Stena Line ferry from Holyhead to Dublin.They took a pit stop at the Holyhead McDonalds, hoping to hear from the broker that the MRN had come through.“We should have it within the hour,” Mr Carry said hopefully, having just missed the 8pm sailing.But it was not to be: as of Monday morning, both men remain stranded in Holyhead, frustrated as their predicament.More fortunate was Kaspars Ukis, the driver of an O’Toole Transport articulated lorry bringing a consignment of salads from the UK to outlets in Ireland. His papers in order, he experienced no difficulties but was anxious about Dublin Port’s capacity to cope when traffic volumes increase.So far, however, the Port’s system of streaming vehicles through the checks, where cheery customs officials waved most through without demur, while gardaí checked identities and ensured Covid tracking locator forms had been filled in, is working smoothly.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Tess Harper-MolloyLife on the Aran Islands breeds resilience. Following a year like no other, islanders begin 2021 filled with worries and hope, but with less in reserve if the coming year brings new troubles.Having grown up in Malahide in Co Dublin, Dara Molloy found urban life unfulfilling before he ultimately retraced the steps of his parents, who had moved from a country childhood to the city, by moving to the islands in 1985.Molloy, who was a Marist priest at the time, quickly knew he was home. In the years afterwards, he lived in a tent then in a hut. Later he left the priesthood. Today, he is married, with four children.He works as a wedding celebrant on the island and on the mainland for those seeking spiritual but non-religious ceremonies. With so many weddings on hold, last year was quiet.“I have a car outside my house I can’t reinsure. We just have no money. And it will take time because people will have to repay what they owe.”Events on the mainland eventually affect the Aran Islands. But in the startling year that was 2020, there was one striking distinction between the two, since the islands managed to remain almost entirely free of Covid-19.Just one household was affected there. During the first lockdown, islanders fretted over whether they should open ferry and plane routes to summer visitors once national restrictions lifted. In the early summer, a vote was held to gauge local feelings. The vast majority of residents – some 80 per cent – wanted to keep their area closed.“We ended up having a vote through phone messaging. I was very against that because I knew it would be isive – and it was. We all got very angry and we all took sides,” Molloy says.Tourism is crucial for many Aran islanders. But the water between them and the mainland offered a natural fortress against the virus. To many, it seemed foolhardy to invite strangers to walk among them. This led to a tense time in what is usually an easygoing society.“For me, I don’t think anyone has the right to deprive anyone else of an income. The difference here was that if the country was allowed to be opened up, then why weren’t we? We are part of Ireland.“That is how we came to be open in the end. I understand the element of fear that people had. Not everyone here is dependent on tourism. Quite a lot are, but not everyone.”A grim yearInis Mór, the main island, is definitely big enough for one ex-hermit and, it turns out, several Kiwis. Dave O\u0027Halloran\u0027s great-great-grandfather left Ulster in the 1860s to seek his fortune in the New Zealand gold rush.Now, O\u0027Halloran is one of four New Zealanders living on Inis Mór. With his wife Jenny O’Halloran, he runs a seaweed-harvesting business that was started by his father-in-law, Máirtin Concannon, in 2000. The pandemic hit them like a lightning bolt.“We are really lucky that we have a erse pantry of things we can harvest and because we only have myself and my wife employed at the time, we didn’t have to let anyone go.”Usually upbeat, O\u0027Halloran frets about the year ahead and what it will bring.Once the decision was taken to reopen the islands and visitors began to reappear in July, there was no acrimony. Some B\u0026ampBs stayed closed. So, too, did the American Bar on Inis Mór’s quayside. Only Joe Watty’s Bar and the Aran Hotel served hot meals.Unspoiled experienceTourism on the Aran Islands is decades-established. Its profile is changing, with the wifi signal now enviable. Glamping is now available, too, yet the Aran experience has somehow remained unspoiled.If anything, visiting feels like an escape, an opportunity to step back. This year, a strange thing happened. With international tourism obliterated, Irish visitors returned to the Aran Islands in volumes not seen since the late 1970s.“The facilities aren’t really here for that. But I think people were surprised by how much they enjoyed the experience here. I personally think there is a spirit here you can kind of feel. It is a good place with good people.”O’Malley owns and runs Joe Watty’s, located five minutes’ walk from the Inis Mór pier, with her husband, PJ Flaherty. High season meant 13-hour days and seven-day weeks. The bar is now closed, amid the latest coronavirus restrictions.With 19 staff, she was nervous of the virus. However, demand from visitors was constant. On long fine evenings, holiday-makers stood in line outside for hours waiting for a table. A fortune could have been made ferrying out drinks, but they stuck religiously to the Covid-19 rules.Leaving people waiting so long went against O’Malley’s hospitality instincts, but everyone got fed. Every venue lacked live music, too, an abnormality on the island. But sticking by the rules kept the virus at bay, she believes.“For bed and breakfast owners, generally speaking, this was their home they were opening up, which must have been very difficult. But I think they were just scrupulous about the rules,” she says.“The gardaí were in frequently to us. We got one phone call one time saying that someone who ate on the deck one Sunday tested positive later. That was it.”By 4pm the winter light is dipping and the Christmas lights twinkle. What comes in 2021 is an unwritten book, but O’Malley believes the pandemic, no matter when it ends, has permanently changed lives.“I feel it will never be the same again in my working life . . . We used to do a lot of groups from America, France, Australia. That will be slow to return,” she says.“This has turned the whole world on its head. The Irish we had this year were wonderful. If that is sustained, it would be great. If we can return to music sessions, even better. But I haven’t a clue how it will pan out.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"Northern Ireland secretary could detract from Blair statement of regret, officials feared-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449686.1609780147!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"julian assange cannot be extradited from uk to us judge rules","story":"Julian Assange\u0027s partner Stella Morris and his lawyer Jennifer Robinson have called on the US government to drop their case against the Wikileaks founder after a British judge ruled he could not be extradited to the United States to face charges.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Julian Assange: has been held in high security Belmarsh prison since he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London.

Photograph:  Facundo ArrizabalagaWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the United States to face espionage charges because of the risk of suicide, a British judge has ruled. District judge Vanessa Baraitser rejected Mr Assange’s claim that he was the victim of a political prosecution that endangered press freedom but she accepted medical evidence about his mental health. “The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future,” she said. The judge said that faced with conditions of near total isolation and without the protective factors that limited his risk at London’s Belmarsh prison, she was satisfied that the procedures described by the US would not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to take his own life. “For this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge,” she said.The US authorities have 14 days to appeal the decision, during which time Mr Assange will remain in custody unless the judge grants him bail at a hearing on Wednesday. The US sought his extradition to face charges relating to WikiLeaks’s publication of hundreds of thousands of classified documents leaked by former army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. Ms Manning spent seven years in prison for her role in the leaks before Barack Obama commuted her 35-year sentence and she was released in May 2017. The documents included tens of thousands of pages of military reports that became known as the Afghan War Logs and the Iraq War Logs, as well as more than a quarter of a million US state department cables from American embassies around the world that became known as Cablegate. Secret filesInitially charged with one offence of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in jail, Mr Assange was indicted in May 2019 on 17 new charges under the 1917 Espionage Act, each of which carries a maximum of 10 years’ imprisonment. Judge Baraitser ruled that Mr Assange’s communications with Ms Manning about how to gain access to secret files “went beyond the mere encouragement of a journalist”. She said his alleged aiding and abetting of hacking and theft and the disclosure of the identities of US informants which put their lives in danger would also be offences in Britain and there was no reason to believe he would not receive a fair trial in the US. Mr Assange spent seven years in the Ecuadorian embassy in London after Swedish authorities sought to question him in connection with allegations of sexual assault. While he was in the embassy, he fathered two sons with lawyer Stella Moris, who appealed outside the court to Donald Trump to pardon him. “Mr President, tear down these prison walls,” she said. “Let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all.” Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), welcomed the decision not to extradite Mr Assange but said there was much that was troubling in the judgment. “The judge rejected the defence case that the charges against Assange related to actions identical to those undertaken daily by most investigative journalists,” she said. “In doing so, she leaves open the door for a future US administration to confect a similar indictment against a journalist.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4449666.1609754906!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"oxford man 82 is first to receive oxford astrazeneca vaccine","story":"The United Kingdom has started the rollout of the Oxford UniversityAstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, with 82-year-old dialysis patient Brian Pinker the first in the world to receive the shot.

Photograph:  Steve ParsonspoolAFP via Getty ImagesThe UK has become the first country to administer the OxfordAstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine to its population amid rapidly rising case numbers and growing pressure on the NHS.In a statement on Monday, the NHS said that Brian Pinker, an 82-year-old kidney dialysis patient, received the jab at Oxford University Hospital. The vaccine was approved for emergency use by the UK regulator last week.The vaccine will be delivered at a small number of hospitals in the first few days for surveillance reasons, before being rolled out to GP-led services later in the week.Earlier on Monday, health secretary Matt Hancock said that the UK would have more than 1,000 vaccination sites operating by the end of the week.Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca chief executive, has said that his company could supply 2m doses of the vaccine each week.Asked how soon vaccinations could take place at that rate, Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, told BBC Breakfast on Monday: “Certainly this month we’ll be able to get up to that sort of number but that would depend on supplies. We’ll be delivering it as soon as we get it.”The UK is betting on a pragmatic approach to immunisations by lengthening the period between vaccine doses in a bid to deploy wider immunity amid a rapidly resurging outbreak. Some hospitals are under severe strain.The approach is not without controversy: Pfizer, which makes one of the two vaccines approved in the UK, has hit out at the decision, while doctors have criticised pushing back second immunisations for patients who had already received their first jab.The UK has also drawn up emergency provisions to mix vaccine doses under very limited circumstances, which some scientists warned was unusual and not supported by evidence. Health officials insist it would be an emergency measure to be used in extreme cases.Meanwhile, drugmakers are racing to secure their supply chains as officials warn that vaccination targets have not yet been met. The EU, UK and US have all fallen short of their immunisation targets for 2020.European regulators have said they do not expect to approve the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine before next month, while US approval is not expected until April. Indian authorities gave the jab an emergency green light, similar to what the UK has done, over the weekend.The vaccine’s portability and cost make it a much more practical solution for countries that do not have access to ultra-cold supply chains, on which the Moderna and BioNTechPfizer vaccines rely. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boris must bold go history pm lost union","story":"Boris Johnson does not want to be remembered as the man who won back British sovereignty from Brussels, only to lose the British nation itself. Yet this is the fate he risks unless he takes a bold approach to saving the Union. Just over six years ago, Scotland came close to voting for separation. Since then, our leaders might have asked searching questions about our constitution and the cultural, institutional and political reasons for the growing estrangement between Scotland and the rest of the UK. Instead, in a state of panic, they offered more devolved powers, and then ignored the problem altogether.Now the consequences of this inattention are becoming clearer. In the Holyrood elections in May, the Scottish National Party will almost certainly win a majority of seats, and perhaps a majority of the vote. Polls show that most Scots favour secession, and nationalism is most popular among younger voters. The future, Nicola Sturgeon believes, is hers.But all is not yet lost. Nationalists know that support for separation might yet recede. Brexit – held as a reason why Scotland might want to go its own way – in fact makes secession more complex. The old questions for the Nationalists – not least about the currency and border – are still unanswered. And while Scottish voters will not take kindly to the PM refusing to hold another referendum, as he did yesterday, neither will they appreciate an unseemly Nationalist rush for a second vote during a pandemic. Behind the scenes in Whitehall, work is underway as ministers ponder what they can do for Scotland. MPs from across the political spectrum are anxiously discussing what can be done to save the Union. There is talk of yet more devolution, and even a constitutional convention. Still unclear, however, is what the Government actually thinks.The Prime Minister was criticised for his comment that Scottish devolution had been “a disaster”, but he was quite correct. Devolution has misaligned power and accountability, allowing Scottish ministers to claim the credit for successes while escaping scrutiny for their failures. This helps to explain what one Scottish writer calls the “Sturgeon paradox”: the worse she does, especially on education and health, the more popular she becomes. Devolution has allowed the Nationalists to use the Scottish state to attack the Union. The school curriculum, for example, has been manipulated grotesquely to indoctrinate voters of the future. As Gordon Brown, the politician behind Scottish devolution in 1998, has admitted, “It was naive not to anticipate that devolution could create a megaphone for intensifying resentment.”But it was also naive to think that devolution would not cause a dangerous constitutional imbalance. The famous West Lothian Question – which asks why Scottish MPs should have a say on English matters when English MPs have no say over such matters in Scotland – remains unanswered because it is unanswerable. English votes on English laws, the fix provided by the Cameron government, fails to answer the question and creates new problems. By saying legislation applying only to England must have a majority among English MPs as well as the Commons overall, EVEL, as it is known, creates two classes of MP, and makes it harder, perhaps impossible, for an MP from a Scottish constituency to become Chancellor or Prime Minister. It also sets up an inevitable future constitutional crisis: a government elected with a UK majority but no English majority would be unable to govern England and would, for many voters, lack the legitimacy to do so too.So devolution is a disaster for all these reasons and one more: the powers it grants to the Scottish government are clearly insufficient for most Scottish voters. But what can be done? First, the Government must break the cycle of devolving in a panic. Ministers must be clear that they want to reform the constitution because they understand the urgent need to do so, not because they are appeasing nationalists out of fear. And second, their approach must be guided by principle: decentralisation, not devolution, and equality, not disparity, between the four nations.This means moving quickly to a fully-fledged federal model, with a government and parliament for each of the four nations, and a federal government and parliament residing in Westminster. Core functions – foreign policy, defence, international trade and aid, national security, immigration and border control, citizenship, extradition, monetary policy, the constitution and the maintenance of the UK single market – would rest with the federal government. Everything else, including almost all tax policies, would be the responsibility of the four national governments and parliaments.There will be many arguments against this course of action. Constitutional reform is always treated as an inconvenient distraction, but as Brexit shows, where power resides matters. Some worry that England is too big for a federal structure, but if that logic were true, it would be too big for the Union itself. A federal system could anyway still weight constituencies to give a stronger voice to the smaller nations, and would make it more likely than now that a Scottish politician can become Prime Minister.Nobody should be under any illusions of the radicalism of this kind of change. It would require new constitutional laws, and a new role for the Supreme Court. It would almost certainly herald further constitutional change, with the House of Lords replaced at last. But it would bring power closer to the people. It would put right the dangerous imbalances in the way we are governed. It would avoid the kind of constitutional crises that are heading our way. And instead of yet more piecemeal and self-defeating devolution, it would be a self-confident and comprehensive offer to the people of Scotland. For that is what is now necessary. The PM should recall the wise conservative insight that if we value something and want to keep it, we must be prepared to change it. If he values the Union, and wants to avoid the wrong place in history, the change must be great.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"analysis south african coronavirus variant worrying","story":"If the coronavirus was a horror film, we have now reached the obligatory ‘not dead yet’ scare, in which the seemingly conquered monster returns from the grave to give a final fright. Just as light was beginning to emerge at the end of a very long and gloomy tunnel, the South African variant of the virus threatens to undermine the vaccine and testing gains of recent months.Brian Pinker, 82, received the first Oxford vaccine on Sunday, yet there are real concerns that he and the hundreds of thousands of others who have had their jabs may not be fully protected against this latest mutation.Clearly the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expecting some vaccine tweaks to be needed as it has already begun to look at how quickly an altered jab could be approved, and Matt Hancock has said he is very worried.The problem lies in how the virus has mutated. Variants of coronavirus have been around since the beginning of the pandemic and are a natural evolutionary process by which viruses adapt to their hosts as they replicate.Most of these mutations have no effect, but occasionally they can improve the ability of the virus to infect or become more resistant to the body’s immune response. This is one such occasion.The South African variant has three mutations in important genes. One, the N501Y mutation, has already been found in the UK variant and could be responsible for it being so infectious.However, the South African version carries two more mutations (E484K and K417N) that are absent in the British version and make it far more worrying. “These two additional mutations may interfere more with vaccine effectiveness in the South African variant than in the UK variant,” said Dr Julian W Tang, honorary associate professor and clinical virologist, University of Leicester.“This does not mean that the existing Covid-19 vaccines will not work at all, just that the antibodies induced by the current vaccines may not bind and neutralise the South African variant as well as it would the other circulating viruses, including the UK variant.”The South African variant carries mutations in a gene which builds spike proteins – the rod-like structures on the outside of the virus which attaches to human cells.Spike proteins are also produced by vaccines so that the body knows what to look for and what to fight off. So, any significant changes to the spike protein may mean the body can no longer spot the virus, even after vaccination or a previous infection, and antibodies produced in anticipation may not be able to attach properly in order to clear it away.Worryingly, the mutations may also mean that it is harder to pick up cases through the normal Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, so it could have already spread widely. It quickly became the dominant variant in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.Yet there is still hope. Even if the new variant is more infectious, it may not cause more severe disease. England\u0027s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific officer, Patrick Vallance, are believed to have briefed Boris Johnson, claiming they are not overly concerned about the new variant.And even if the South African variant becomes more widespread and dominant, both vaccines can be modified to be more effective against this variant in as little as six weeks. Most scientists believe that existing vaccines will still work to some extent, even if the new variant lowers the overall efficacy. The mutations have not altered the shape of the spike protein to such an extent that antibodies cannot bind at all, they just may be less effective. “It is not anticipated that this mutation is sufficient for the ‘South African’ variant to bypass the protection provided by current vaccines,” said Prof Francois Balloux, professor of computational systems biology, University College London (UCL). “It’s possible that new variants will affect the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, but we shouldn’t make that assumption yet about the South African one.”Researchers are working round the clock to find out just how dangerous this new variant is, and new lockdown measures introduced by the Government will undoubtedly help to stem the tide, and give scientists room to find a new solution.Prof James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, and University of Oxford, said: We can all help if we redouble our efforts to wash our hands, wear a mask and socially distance. The faster and further the vaccine is rolled out, the quicker the end to this nightmare.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel blocked bid secure coronavirus vaccine","story":"Angela Merkel came under fire on Monday after it emerged she intervened personally to block a bid by European health ministers to secure larger orders of coronavirus vaccine over the summer.Public anger is growing across the continent at the European Union’s failure to order enough doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine which was developed in Germany and manufactured in Belgium.But it now appears Mrs Merkel blocked an initiative by the German, French, Italian and Dutch health ministers to order more stocks of  vaccine last summer.Bild newspaper published a leaked letter from the four health ministers to Ursula von der Leyen in which they agreed to drop the initiative and hand over control of vaccine orders to the European Commission.According to the newspaper, the letter was written under pressure from Mrs Merkel, who wanted to send a signal of solidarity at the start of Germany’s six-month EU presidency.“We believe that it is of utmost importance to have a common joint and single approach towards the various pharmaceutical companies,” the four ministers wrote.“We also consider that speed is of the essence in this case. So we deem it very useful if the Commission takes the lead in this process.”In fact, Europe began to fall behind in the race to secure sufficient stocks after the Commission took over.The four ministers had already negotiated an order for 400m doses of the Astra-Zeneca vaccine, but the Commission became locked in protracted negotiations as the UK and US secured large orders.The row came with the European Medicine Agency (EMA) poised to approve the Moderna vaccine this week. It will become the second vaccine approved for use in the EU, following the Pfzier-BioNTech vaccine.Jean-Claude Juncker, Mrs von der Leyen’s predecessor as commission president, spoke out against the EU’s response to the virus, telling Luxembourg’s Télécran magazine the bloc had “reacted very weakly”. But he added that the EU was hamstrung by the fact member states retain control of health policy.Mr Juncker claimed he continues to act as an unofficial advisor to Mrs von der Leyen, and compared himself the former Pope Benedict XVI.“I always say I am like Ratzinger in the Vatican Gardens: I am their Ratzinger,” Mr Juncker said, using Pope Benedict’s birth name. “She likes it a lot, and it gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas from time to time, which is very useful for both of us.

Some of the characters and catch phrases were more suitable for the pages of the  than others.One particular sketch, funny even to those of us with no interest in football, featured a coach and his assistant, the latter of whom mimicked exactly the movements and words of his boss to try to make it look like he knew what he was doing. The sketch became an internet meme earlier this year when it was used to criticise Nicola Sturgeon who, it should be remembered, started off this Covid-19 pandemic by only announcing restrictions once she was certain Number 10 was just about to do the same. Safety in numbers, and all that.And then Keir Starmer. Yesterday, with speculation mounting that the prime minister was about to introduce stricter measures to counter the virus, the Labour leader told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in … many parts of the country … I’m fully, fully reconciled to that.”A few hours later, presumably having eaten a third Weetabix, Starmer was becoming positively pugilistic: “We can’t allow the prime minister to use up the next two or three weeks and then bring in the national lockdown that is inevitable. Do it now. That’s the necessary first step to get the virus back under control.”Strong stuff. A refreshing show of leadership when the country needs it most. Perhaps., perhaps inadvertently, put it succinctly: “Speaking after the prime minister acknowledged that Covid-19 restrictions were ‘probably about to get tougher’, Starmer said immediate action must be taken.” Note the second word of that sentence.And then there was the difficult question of whether primary schools should re-open this week. The teaching unions, as usual, are demanding they remain closed (they will find themselves on the front page of every newspaper the day they call for schools to function normally). Surely Starmer would take a stand on an issue so close to the hearts of so many of his own members (especially those without school aged children)? Nope. “I don’t want to call for the closure of schools tomorrow morning and add to the chaos, but we do need to recognise that it’s inevitable that more schools will close, and we need a plan in place to deal with that.”Were it to become clear that Johnson was about to announce that all primary schools were to remain closed, you get the distinct impression that Starmer would be doing his assistant coach act again, running out to the media minutes before the prime minister got the chance to do the same and “demanding” that Johnson keep all schools closed. This behaviour seems to have been a pattern throughout the pandemic and throughout Starmer’s short tenure as leader of the opposition. The tactic is shrouded in phrases like “constructive opposition” so that a refusal to advocate radical, perhaps even unpopular, solutions can be explained by the need for national unity. Yet such a commitment to pulling in the same direction hasn’t prevented Starmer and his team from seeking party advantage by claiming to be one step ahead of ministers, when in fact they’re merely pre-announcing whatever the government has already decided to do.Does Starmer have an alternative? It seems unfair to expect the opposition to advocate solutions to a crisis when all the resources and scientific support is concentrated in the government’s corner. And there is much wisdom in Napoleon’s dictum that you should never interrupt your opponent when he’s making a mistake. But even that doesn’t excuse a safety-first strategy where Labour comes out in support of government decisions only when they’re sure that policy will, in fact, be enacted. If ministers make mistakes, then Labour, by offering support in advance, will find it difficult to distance themselves from them.It’s not as if the party can afford to remain silent on the biggest issue facing the country (although Starmer must wish that certain members of his team would do exactly that). But waiting until you’re sure of what the government is planning to do next before advocating exactly that policy, except with a few bells on, is hardly the kind of courageous and principled leadership that Starmer promised.He’s hardly endearing himself to the left of his own party either. A quick Twitter search reveals deep unhappiness among some Labour activists because of Starmer’s refusal (so far) to do exactly what the teachers’ unions tell him to do. But it’s not the unions whose lead Starmer is following, it’s the prime minister’s. That’s the safest course.And he’s right. Pre-announcing whatever Number 10 says is the most risk-free strategy for a party leader who values responsibility and electoral credibility far more than voter-repellent radicalism. But the tactic is also cynical, and it’s becoming more transparent every day.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid alert levels coronavirus 5 uk","story":"The UK’s coronavirus threat level has been moved to the highest rating for the first time, as the four chief medical officers (CMOs) on Monday warned the NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed in just three weeks time.The Joint Biosecurity Centre has moved the country up to Level 5, signalling that the spread and severity of the virus has now eclipsed the first wave in March. In a joint statement, the CMOs warned that “many parts” of the four nations’ health systems are “already under immense pressure”. “There are currently very high rates of community transmission, with substantial numbers of COVID patients in hospitals and in intensive care,” they continued.Cases are rising almost everywhere, in much of the country driven by the new more transmissible variant. “We are not confident that the NHS can handle a further sustained rise in cases and without further action there is a material risk of the NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days.While the alert levels, which were first established at the onset of the pandemic, are separate from the Tier system, they are used by the Government to help assess how draconian measures should be. The level is determined by a number of factors, including the UK\u0027s R number and the number of confirmed Covid cases at any one time.During the first lockdown, which saw non-essential retail, schools and hospitality shut down for months, the alert level was set at Level 4, reflecting the fact there was a “high or rising level of transmission.”However, under Level 5, the virus is deemed to be spreading to such an extent that stricter social distancing measures are required. It means that measures will likely need to go beyond those implemented in the second lockdown to bring the virus under control.So what are the five different levels and what are they likely to mean to us and daily life? For our lives to return to normal, we would need no transmission of infections in England. This situation is currently only foreseen in the event of a successful vaccine being administered across the country. Oxford University hopes to have a vaccine ready by as early as September.Likely response: No venue closures clinically vulnerable able to leave homes.The Government would need to be confident that virus transmission was at minimal levels.Likely response: Shops and restaurants could be allowed to open with social distancing measures. Supermarkets have already successfully implemented social distancing and restaurants are considering ways to space out tables. Clinically vulnerable people are likely to be advised to remain indoors.The number of new infections would not be increasing significantly. The reproduction rate, or R number, would be below one, meaning that each infected person is transmitting the infection to less than one other, on average.Likely response: Partial lockdown, although with significant relaxations compared to level four.The virus is not contained, with the R number above one in at least some areas. However, as is the situation now, hospitals would be able to cope with the levels of admissions.Likely response: Nationwide lockdown imposed by the Government, with the vulnerable shielded and those who can work from home asked to do so. During the UK lockdown, Britain was at this level. Infection spreading at a highly dangerous rate, with the R number significantly above one. The NHS would be overwhelmed with patients, with many hospitals over capacity. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"debate should teachers moved front vaccine queue","story":"At some point, Boris Johnson’s Government may find itself having to take on the National Education Union just as Mrs Thatcher took on the National Union of Mineworkers. Throughout this crisis it has acted as a huge block to the education of children. Back in the spring, it objected not just to schools reopening but also to teachers being asked to give lessons remotely. The Union’s letter to its members suggesting that they refuse to go to work on the grounds that working conditions are “unsafe” is tantamount to calling for a national strike, without a vote. It is a raw exercise of power in the manner of Arthur Scargill. It isn’t hard to imagine what would happen if workers in the food and supermarket industry adopted the same attitude – the nation would starve.Yet there is one simple way in which the Government could manage to keep schools open and sidestep a potentially costly political row: to follow the suggestion made by some prominent union figures and make a priority of teachers, and other workers in public-facing roles, in the vaccine rollout programme. At the moment, there are no plans to administer the vaccine on the basis of occupation, aside from healthcare workers and care home workers. Understandably, they come pretty high up the list – they are being vaccinated along with the over 80s and ahead of the 75 to 80 year olds.But as for other occupations, all the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will say is: “Occupational prioritisation could form part of a second phase of the programme, which would include healthy iniduals from 16 years of age up to 50 years of age”. That means, bizarrely, that someone like me – 54, working from home in a low-density rural area – will take precedence over 49-year-old teachers, bus drivers, police officers, security guards and other occupations whose members constantly come into contact with members of the public. Research by the Office for National Statistics in April found a huge difference between various occupations in age-standardised death rates from Covid. Security guards, at 43 deaths per 100,000 up to April 20 came off worst of all professional occupations, at 6 per 100,000 suffered the least. Taxi drivers (36) and Factory workers (37) came off far worse than carers (23) and health care workers (10.2) – although the latter doesn’t distinguish between intensive care doctors and nurses, and, say, consultants in disciplines which saw fewer patients than normal.    Few teachers at that point, were working in school. But making a priority of vaccinating them now – along with workers in other vulnerable occupations – would turbocharge the process of getting society back to normal as soon as possible. Schools are especially important in this, and not just because children suffer terribly from an absence of schooling, those from low income families in particular, but because closing schools creates a huge childcare problem for parents who work in other fields.It would be impossible not to sympathise with the frustrations of those in the vulnerable category who may have to wait if teachers and others were to be moved above them in the queue, but with so much of society on hold and likely to be so for several months to come difficult choices must be made about our immediate priorities.Moving teachers up the list would finally dispel the arguments of teaching unions that their workplaces are unsafe, allowing schools to remain open while the rest of the population awaited the jab. Why can’t the Government spot this wide open goal and tap the ball in?The Denial by Ross Clark is published by Lume Books Teaching unions’ main purpose used to be to defend the rights of teachers, typically over issues like pay and accusations of misconduct. These days, however, the National Education Union is more of a political lobbying group than a workers’ union, taking any opportunity to oppose the Conservative government.Recent calls from union leaders for schools to close until teachers have been vaccinated are clearly political, essentially blackmailing the government and holding schools to ransom until their unreasonable demands have been met. Ministers must not be tempted to cave in.There has been a lot of careful thought and planning behind the decision as to who should benefit from the first wave of vaccinations. As a former teacher, I don’t think most of my colleagues would feel comfortable skipping the queue, especially as teachers don’t tend to be in the “at risk” group, with an average age in the early 30s. Schools are possibly the safest place to be, with all the extra hygiene and cleaning measures in place to protect young people and teaching staff. It makes no logical sense to take vaccines away from those who need them, merely to appease a militant union’s extreme demands.The vaccine is a life-saving measure and must be distributed in the first instance among those who need it the most, the vulnerable and the elderly. The intended aim of the lockdown restrictions is to reduce the number of deaths and the number of hospitalisations caused by Covid. Vaccinating teachers will not help significantly on either of those fronts. Vaccinating the vulnerable elderly, on the other hand, will – and can help shorten the time we spend in lockdown.Prioritising teachers would also risk setting a dangerous precedent. If we start changing the criteria now it will surely lead to other professions wanting to readdress their situation. However, we cannot expect the vulnerable to wait until all of them have had a jab. While supplies are limited, we must be stringent and sensible. Throughout the pandemic we’ve seen unrealistic demand after demand from the unions. If the Government were to agree to vaccinate teachers, it is easy to predict what the unions’ next one would be – that schools only reopen once every staff member has been vaccinated. It is difficult to say how long that might take, but it would be a delay that many children simply cannot afford.What is most disturbing is the widening of the social ide over the last year. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are falling behind their wealthy peers. School is a sanctuary for many vulnerable children who would otherwise suffer neglect, abuse and exploitation, not to mention the academic impact of being out of education for extended periods of time. Not every household has a fast internet connection, a working computer or a safe and quiet space to work. We’re already seeing a worrying lack of progress, with key stage three pupils 15 to 22 months behind where we’d expect.Attempting to move all schools online does our young people a disservice. We owe them more than this, we have a duty of care. The teachers’ unions are being short sighted in their political lobbying.

We\u0027ve already delivered over a million vaccines of the Pfizer jab now we\u0027ve got the AstraZeneca one, so we aim to get it into people\u0027s arms as quickly as it is supplied to us.If we get two million doses a week, our aim is to get two million doses into the arms of those priority groups.Asked what AstraZeneca has said about supplies, Prof Powis said: As the Prime Minister said, we\u0027re aiming for tens of millions of doses by the time we get to April. This is a new vaccine, each batch will need to be looked at before it\u0027s released, so that schedule will become clearer over the next few weeks, but, as I said, we are raring to go. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: This is a pivotal moment in our fight against this awful virus and I hope it provides renewed hope to everybody that the end of this pandemic is in sight.He urged everyone to continue to follow the coronavirus restrictions while the vaccination programme is under way to keep cases down and protect our loved ones.The UK has secured 100 million doses of the OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine as part of its contract, enough for most of the population.While some 530,000 doses are to be available from Monday, the Department for Health said that tens of millions more are to be delivered in the coming weeks and months once batches have been quality checked.It comes almost a month after rollout of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech began, with more than one million people having now received their first dose.Second doses of either vaccine will now take place within 12 weeks rather than the 21 days that was initially planned with the PfizerBioNTech jab, following a change in guidance which aims to accelerate immunisation.This has been defended by the UK\u0027s four chief medical officers following criticism, including from the British Medical Association (BMA).The doctors\u0027 union said it was grossly and patently unfair for at-risk patients whose imminent second jab appointments would now be rescheduled.The OxfordAstraZeneca jab is easier to transport and store than the PfizerBioNTech vaccine, which needs cold storage of around minus 70C.Because it can be stored at fridge temperatures, between two and eight degrees, it is easier to distribute to care homes and other locations across the UK.In line with recommendations of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), vaccination is being rolled out to priority groups including care home residents and staff, people over 80 and healthcare workers.GPs and local vaccination services have been asked to ensure every care home resident in their local area is vaccinated by the end of January, according to DHSC.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"georgia run offs democratic odd couple carry joe bidens hopes","story":"The sky was pure blue and the trees heavy with Spanish moss on Sunday lunchtime when Jon Ossoff took the microphone in a park on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia.“Y’all, Tuesday is it,” said the 33-year-old Democratic candidate for the US Senate, tie-less in a blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up. “Tuesday is everything.”Around 200 supporters had turned out, above expectations. Some muttered “yes sir” and “preach it” as Mr Ossoff’s stump speech outlined what was on the line.“The whole country is watching us right now,” he said. “The whole country is watching Georgia to see what kind of a statement we’re going to make about the values that we stand for, about what\u0027s in our hearts as a state and as a people.”He was not wrong. Across the rest of America, the US election - which happened two months ago - is already fading into the past along with the rest of 2020. But not in Georgia.Thanks to the quirks of the state’s electoral system, the occupants of its two US Senate seats will be decided on Tuesday after ‘run-offs’ were ordered when no candidate got more than 50 per cent of the vote in November.Hanging in the balance is not just state power, however, but control of the Senate. Currently the Republicans hold 50 seats and the Democrats 48 with these two races outstanding.Win both and the Democrats pull equal, with Kamala Harris, the incoming US vice president, casting the deciding vote - allowing them to control proceedings. Lose just one and the Republicans keep their majority and ability to veto measures.US president-elect Joe Biden’s legislative agenda is on the line.Those watching Mr Ossoff in the Savannah sun were pulling out all the stops to flip the seats in the Democrats\u0027 favour. Sam Gostomski, a 24-year-old volunteer checking the temperatures of attendees as a coronavirus safety precaution, had travelled all the way from Austin to help out.He was among a group of 25 young Texans who upped sticks to Georgia on Boxing Day to knock doors and help run events. Most had worked on the Biden campaign and saw the state as unfinished business.“All of that work doesn’t mean as much if we don’t take the Senate and get some reforms passed,” Mr Gostomski said. “It’s not an exaggeration to say this is the most important race in America right now.Mr Ossoff is a documentary filmmaker who shot to prominence in 2017 by almost winning a House of Representatives seat in Georgia and packs his speeches with lofty appeals to the greater good.He has a youthful exuberance similar to Beto O\u0027Rourke, the ex-Texas congressman who ran for the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.The Democrat seeking the other Georgia seat, Rev Raphael Warnock, is quite different. A 51-year-old African-American, he was the pastor at Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church - famous for once being Martin Luther King\u0027s congregation - before turning to politics.Rev Warnock’s addresses have the ring of the pulpit. Speaking at a drive-in rally also in Savannah on Sunday - his hometown - he referenced his spiritual upbringing while taking aim at his Republican opponent Kelly Loeffler, 50. “She’s been busy, as we say in church, calling me everything but a child of God. Lying on me, misrepresenting my record. We say in church, scandalising my name,” Rev Warnock said.“But that’s alright. My mumma told me that it’s not what they call you, it’s what you answer to. And in just a few days she can call me Senator Raphael Warnock.”They make an odd couple, these two politicians who carry Mr Biden\u0027s hopes of passing bold new left-wing laws. “My brother from another mother” is how Rev Warnock refers to Mr Ossoff. They also represent two cornerstones of the Democratic Party\u0027s support base: young progressives and African-Americans.To win, supporters and politicians on both sides agree, the Democrats need vast turnout. They did just that in November, registering scores of new voters - many African-American - and making Mr Biden the first Democratic presidential nominee to win Georgia since 1992.The signs are encouraging. Early voting, which tends to favour the Left, has been high. Polling averages suggest both Democrats lead by around two percentage points.Donations have poured into the state, with Mr Ossoff and Rev Warnock each raising more than $100 million, making them the best-funded Senate candidates in US history - though their rivals are close behind.But Republicans, who have dominated politics in the southern state for decades, remain hopeful. They believe the chance to rob Mr Biden of Senate power will reinvigorate conservatives eager to block progressive causes.Ms Loeffler, who is married to the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange and estimated to be the richest US senator, dubbed her opponent Rev Warnock a “radical liberal” 13 times during a recent debate, summarising the key Republican attack line. Campaign adverts have dredged up controversial comments Rev Warnock made while preaching, framing him as anti-America. He in turn released a smiley ad of himself walking a puppy and while wearing a gilet to allay fears. It has been viewed 6 million times online. Mr Ossoff’s opponent, the 71-year-old incumbent Republican David Perdue, took a different track. He has attempted to ignore his young opponent, even refusing to debate him - leaving the Democrat free to answer questions next to an empty podium.The election\u0027s biggest unknown factor comes thanks to Donald Trump, who like Mr Biden was due to campaign in the state on Monday. His repeated insistence without evidence that mass fraud robbed him of election victory threatens to deter Republicans from voting.Furthermore he has gone to war with leading Georgia Republicans who have refused to meddle with vote counts to overturn Mr Biden’s win, most recently calling the Georgia secretary of state for an hour to demand action. The leaked audio triggered a new scandal.The political danger was evident on Sunday afternoon as around 50 Republicans gathered amid $50 cushions and wooden carved crosses at a boutique furniture store in downtown Savannah for a pre-vote pep talk.Tim Scott, the Republican senator from nearby South Carolina, praised the virtues of a sign he had seen in the Peach State which declared “pick peaches, not socialism”, hammering home the party’s main message while not mentioning claims of voter fraud.Both for some attendees that issue was front and centre. Melynda Loomis, the 52-year-old treasurer of the local Republican branch wearing a bright red MAGA face mask and a Trump Deplorable badge, expressed concern. “I’m terrified,” she said of the outcome of Tuesday\u0027s vote.Asked if the result will be close, she echoed Mr Trump’s unproven allegations: “It won’t be if you could only count the humans that are alive, but there are all the ballots from dead people.”Ms Loomis went one step further - she knows Republicans who will not vote in the run-off after losing faith with US democracy. “They don’t believe it anymore and that’s sad, she said. They don’t think their vote counts.If many others follow suit, Mr Trump’s last month in office could deliver a final irony: in pursuing claims of election fraud so relentlessly he could hand the Senate to the man who defeated him. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlTo order The 2020 limited-edition Matt Christmas jigsaw, go to telegraphcartoonjigsawsOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson confirms third national lockdown to last until MarchThe priority list for the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines - and how they will be rolled outNicola Sturgeon imposes full \u0026#39stay at home\u0026#39 lockdown in Scotland until at least end of JanuaryMan questioned in Egypt after posting viral video showing Covid patients \u0026#39running out of oxygen\u0026#39Hospital boss calls covid deniers behaviour \u0026#39shocking\u0026#39 and \u0026#39awful\u0026#39 after they are removed from siteAre gyms open?

But he stopped short of wearing trousers, mistakenly believing his lower half was safely out of shot of his phone\u0027s camera.Unfortunately for Mr De Wever, a mirror behind him revealed his sartorial choices to viewers tuning into Flemish broadcaster Radio 2’s morning show.It took until the four-minute mark of the short interview on Saturday for the presenter to gently break the news to the mayor.“You are wearing a very nice shirt, probably you donned it especially for us. But under that shirt, could it be that you are there in your underwear?” Kim Debrie asked Mr De Wever, who heads the Flemish separatist party, N-VA.“How do you know that?” De Wever said, before realising the problem. “I’m probably sitting in front of a mirror. I had not taken that into account. The year begins with a particularly embarrassing moment, I’ll remember this for a long time.”Georges-Louis Bouchez, Mr De Wever’s counterpart in the French-speaking liberal party, cheekily wished the mayor a happy New Year in a tweet that also included a picture of a pair of boxer shorts decked out in the Belgian flag.Mr De Wever is not the first political figure to be caught trouser-less. Irish MEP Luke Flanagan accidentally set his iPad in portrait mode during a meeting in June that included budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn while only wearing what appeared to be underpants.Flanagan later insisted that they were running shorts and that he had just returned home from a run when the meeting was scheduled to begin. The Irishman also quipped that his legs had aroused such immense interest on social media that he should get them insured.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"schools stay closed january where when reopen uk areas covid","story":"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a new national lockdown at 8pm tonight to try to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus.The tightening of measures could mean that schools in England are forced to close until February half term, only a day after most schools reopened for face-to-face learning.But it is still unclear whether Primary as well as Secondary school pupils will return to remote learning from home.Boris Johnson had insisted it was safe for parents to send their children to school on Jan 4, and said the risk to teachers is no greater than it is to anyone else.He spoke on the Andrew Marr Show on Jan 3 following another government U-turn, in which all primary schools in London were told to remain closed for the first two weeks of the new term after protests from local authorities.But the move prompted backlash from four national teaching unions, who called for the delay to apply to all schools in England amid concerns the new strain of Covid-19 poses a threat to teachers.Ofsted\u0027s chief inspector Amanda Spielman said children\u0027s time out of the classroom should be kept to the absolute minimum.While Anne Longfield, the Children\u0027s Commissioner for England, echoed Mrs Spielman\u0027s sentiments and called for teachers to be vaccinated as a priority.Some councils have taken matters into their own hands, such as Brighton and Hove City Council, which advised its primary schools to reopen remotely despite government advice.The Prime Minister said: My message to such councils is that they should be guided by the public health advice, which at the moment is that schools are safe in those areas where we\u0027re not being driven by the new variant to close them.Senior government sources have admitted some schools could stay shut until mid-February if Tier 4 restrictions fail.Asked if he would close primary schools if the restrictions could not contain the virus, Mr Johnson said: We\u0027ve got to keep things under constant review but we will be driven not by any political considerations but entirely by the public health question.Ministers are due to review school closures on Jan 18.The overwhelming majority of primary schools are opening as planned on Jan 4, Gavin Williamson said, but in a small number of Tier 4 areas where infection rates are highest, only vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers will attend primary schools in person.  Every school has been instructed to draw up plans to ensure children continue to receive an education even if they have to stay at home.Keeping schools open as long as possible is uppermost in all of our plans, Mr Williamson told the Commons.The evidence about the new Covid variant and rising infection rates have required some immediate adjustment to our plans for the new term.Read more on the tier system: In the following areas, primary schools will only open for vulnerable children and children of key workers on Jan 4:Pupils will return to secondary schools on a staggered basis during the first full three weeks of January. This is to allow for mass Covid testing, in which pupils in Year 11 and Year 13 will be prioritised because of GCSE and A-Level studies.This means most secondary school pupils will stay at home until at least Jan 18, when secondary schools and colleges will reopen fully after two weeks of mass testing - two weeks after term was supposed to start.Because the Covid infection rate is particularly high among this age group, we are going to allow more time so that every school and college is able to roll-out testing for all of its pupils and staff, Mr Williamson said.This kind of mass testing will benefit everyone in the community. It will break those chains of transmission.When schools reopened in September the Government published 25,000 words of guidance explaining how school children and staff should be kept safe.Older children will be encouraged to avoid close contact with one another, in part because risks increase with age. Teachers are not restricted to a single bubble, but are urged to stay at the front of any classroom to reduce contact. In class, pupils must sit spaced out side-by-side and facing forward.The use of the staff room by teachers is also meant to be “minimised”. Schools must contact local health protection teams immediately so those in close contact with the child can be traced. Currently, pupils in a bubble, year group and very rarely the entire school could be asked to self-isolate. A mobile testing unit could be sent to a campus. Schools will be offered serial testing of close contacts of staff and pupils who test positive to negate the need for entire year groups to self-isolate at home.Teachers who help a child with symptoms do not have to self-isolate unless they develop symptoms themselves. However, they should thoroughly wash their hands and wear PPE while with the child. The area where someone suspected of having Covid-19 has been must then be intensively cleaned.If a parent insists a child with symptoms should attend school, the headteacher can refuse to take the pupil if they believe there is a threat to others.Staff will also supply and promote the use of tissues as part of the “catch it, bin it, kill it” technique to control germs.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"south korean flagged tanker seized iran state media reports","story":"Iran provoked fresh confrontations with the West today by seizing an oil tanker in the Persian Gulf and confirming it would further enrich the raw materials for a nuclear bomb, in violation of international agreements.  South Korea mobilised its forces in the Strait of Hormuz and dispatched an anti-piracy unit to the Gulf on Monday afternoon after a ship bearing its flag, the MT Hankuk Chemi, was intercepted off the coast of Oman and escorted into Iranian waters.The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) later confirmed it had seized the vessel and detained its crew in the southern port of Bandar Abbas, due to the repeated infringement of maritime environmental laws.Iranian media reported that the ship, which was carrying 7,200 tonnes of oil chemical products from Saudi Arabia to Fujairah, in the United Arab Emirates, had been “polluting the Persian Gulf with chemicals”.  But this was denied by the South Korean foreign ministry, which demanded the immediate release of the vessel and its crew of 20 from South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam and Myanmar.The American Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which patrols the Middle East, said it was monitoring the incident amid a backdrop of escalating tensions between Tehran and Washington DC in the final weeks of the Trump Administration.Iran is also in dispute with South Korea, which has for months refused to release $7 billion (£5.2 billion) Iranian oil revenues currently held in its banks, citing US-led sanctions.The seizure came as the Iranian government announced that it would resume enriching uranium at five times the limit set by a 2015 pact with major world powers, complicating any efforts by European nations or US-President elect Joe Biden to save the deal.The process for producing 20 percent enriched uranium has started at Shahid Alimohammadi enrichment complex,” the spokesman Ali Rabiei said, referring to a facility at Fordow, south of Tehran, which is deep within a mountain.Enrichment at 20 per cent remains short of the 90 per cent purity required to make a viable nuclear bomb, but the European Union warned the move was a “considerable departure” from the 2015 nuclear deal signed with the US, Britain, China and other leading nations, under which Iran was supposed to keep enrichment below 4 per cent.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the announcement meant that Tehran could only be trying to develop nuclear weapons. He added that his country would “not allow” that to happen.The nuclear deal has been in jeopardy since 2018, when President Trump withdrew from the agreement and imposed sanctions designed to cripple the Iranian economy.He subsequently ordered the killing of Qassem Soleimani, the IRGC commander, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport last year.The Pentagon on Sunday said the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, would remain deployed in the Middle East to counter Iranian threats following the first anniversary of the killing, which has been marked amid renewed threats of vengeance from Iran’s allies and proxy groups across the region.The IRGC has previously seized or attacked ships in the Gulf, most recently in 2019 when it impounded the British tanker Stena Impero for two months and was accused of placing limpet mines on other foreign vessels.On Thursday a limpet mine was discovered aboard MT Pola, a Liberian-flagged tanker in the Persian Gulf off Basra, Iraq, and had to be defused by military experts, although it was not clear who was responsible.    The Foreign Office did not respond to requests for comment. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tier 5 lockdown rules restrictions covid uk","story":"The  understands that discussions about the return of shielding have already begun in Government, and a further announcement on school closures could come as soon as tonight.  He told the BBC\u0027s Marr show on Jan 3: It\u0027s the Tier 4 restrictions, it\u0027s obeying them. It is thinking about breaking essentially every possible route of transmission we possibly can. Those are the things that are absolutely necessary and it is pretty clear we\u0027re going to need more.When asked if he thought that schools also would need to close as part of these measures, he said: We know transmission happens within schools, we know that a person between 12 and 16 is seven times more likely than others in a household to bring an infection into a household.Three-quarters of England is now living under Tier 4 restrictions.Rules in Tier 4 are similar to those of the last national lockdown:Pressure has been mounting on ministers to expand Tier 4 restrictions in the face of increasing strain on hospitals in England, where the number of patients has surpassed the April peak of the first wave.On Dec 29, the NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens warned that doctors and nurses were back in the eye of the storm.Speaking on Jan 4, the Prime Minister stated that there were tough, tough weeks ahead, hinting that another tier of restrictions could be introduced in an attempt to control the virus. On Jan 2, the UK recorded  57,725 new cases of Covid-19, with cases topping 50,000 for five days running.

This took the country\u0027s total to 74,570.Healthcare workers have pleaded with people to take the restrictions seriously, as hospitals report huge difficulties with capacity and staffing. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, said some trusts were reporting up to three times the number of Covid patients as at the peak of the first wave.This means hospitals and also ambulance services in Tier 4 areas and beyond are incredibly busy, compounded by increasing staff absences due to illness and the need to self-isolate, she said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ex snp mp margaret ferrier","story":"NewsEx-SNP MP Margaret Ferrier arrested for alleged breach of Covid restrictionsThe Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP was suspended by the SNP after she admitted travelling to London and back when she should have been self isolatingmirrorShareByLizzy BuchanPolitical Correspondent:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video sir-keir-starmer-calls-snps-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

He was also Boris Johnson’s rival for the Tory leadership in summer .Mr Hunt wrote on Twitter : Time to act: thread on why we need to close schools, borders, and ban all household mixing RIGHT AWAY.To those arguing winter is always like this in the NHS: you are wrong. I faced four serious winter crises as Health Sec and the situation now is off-the-scale worse than any of those. Itaposs true that we often had to cancel elective care in Jan to protect emergency care but that too is under severe pressure with record trolley waits for the very sickest patients. Even more worryingly fewer heart attack patients appear to be presenting in ICUs, perhaps because they are not dialling  when they need to. Full credit to NHS for keeping cancer services open but in Wave  there was still a   drop in cancer appts: people didnapost come forward to GPs or want to go to hospitals, with many potentially avoidable cancer deaths. We hoped to avoid that this time but now looking unlikely. Ministers face mounting pressure to stop dragging their feet and announce another national lockdown amid concerns the new iant is spreading out of control.  The Prime Minister said there was “no question” about the need for tougher measures. But yet again he wouldnapost say how quickly the change will come - telling reporters it would be announced “in due course”. And we wouldnapost say what the measures might be. New data show a % rise in the number of confirmed coronavirus patients in hospital in England between Christmas Day and January . More Covid- patients are now in English hospitals than during the first peak in early April. It is thought some or all of the % of England currently in Tier , will move into Tier . Both Tiers  and  ban pubs or restaurants opening, and ban social gatherings between households inside or in gardens.  Tier  also shuts non-essential shops and hairdressers orders people to “stay at home” other than essential reasons bans non-essential travel or overnight stays away from the house and bans social gatherings even in parks. But government advisors SAGE have warned Tier  alone will not be enough to bring the crucial R number below . Primary schools in  council areas are already told to close, and more areas may be told to join them later this week.

All schools must shut until at least the February half-term and you must stay at home except for five specic reasons. Shielding will resume and all pubs must shut - with takeaway pints banned. Boris Johnson gave a TV address after , people tested on a single day - December  - tested positive.England has , patients in hospital, % more than during the first peak of the virus in April, as a new iant rips through the nation. And the case rate in England up to December  was over  per , - three times the . on December . The lockdown will begin tonight but only actually begin in law as soon as possible - probably tomorrow or the next day. People and businesses are being asked to follow the rules from now, even before they become law. How will the new lockdown affect you  Have your say in the comments below. The new lockdown applies across the whole of England, even the Scilly Isles which had been in Tier . There is no set end date, but it will be reviewed by the week of February . People who have been vaccinated will not be exempt from any lockdown rules. MPs will get a vote on the new measures when parliament is recalled on Wednesday. There is likely to be fury at the PM for delaying over precious days after he knew the new iant was spreading through society. The lockdown is more similar to the first one in March than the most recent in November but there are subtle dferences. Here are the new rules that have been announced and what they mean for you. Full details were due to be published tonight on gov.uk. aposStay at homeapos order  There will be a very firm “stay at home” message similar to the March lockdown - and effective immediately. You may only leave home for one of these five specic reasons:To go to workit’s impossible to work from home, e.g. construction or critical worker who can’t work from home To shop for necessities including food and medicine To exercise, which can be with up to one other person from outside your household or bubble. The exercise should ideally be limited to once per day. Guidance is that people should try to do this locally. To provide care or help to a vulnerable person. To attend medical appointments or seek medical care or fleeing the threat of harm or violence.Police will have legal powers to enforce through fines and dispersing orders. Fines will stay at their current level of roughly £ for a first offence. Schools, education and childcare  All primary schools, secondary schools and colleges will shut to almost all pupils from tomorrow. Only children of key workers and vulnerable kids can attend in person. Others will learn remotely. This is in line with the March lockdown and much stricter than the November lockdown. There will be a system to get free school meals to eligible kids but it hasn’t been announced or rolled out yet. BTec exams will go ahead this week but GCSEs and A-levels this summer are unlikely to proceed as planned. Boris Johnson said: We recognise that this will mean it is not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer as normal. The Education Secretary will work with Ofqual to put in place alternative arrangements. Thereaposs no current plan announced to hand out more laptops to disadvantaged children, but itaposs something ministers are looking at.Early years such as nurseries alternative provision and special schools remain open in the lockdown. Nursery age, vulnerable kids and kids of critical workers over  can still attend childcare. University students will not be able toand will be expected to study from their current residence where possible until at least mid February. In person teaching at university will only be allowed for a small number of critical courses previously announced such as those studying to work in the health service. Meeting friends and family  You cannot meet people from outside your household or bubble anywhere - indoors or outdoors. The only exemption is that one person can take exercise outside with one person from another household. But you cannot sit down and have a drink together in the park, as you could previously under Tier . Under Tier , children under  or certain adults with care needs didn’t count towards that two-person limit. It’s not fully clear yetthat rule has survived into the full lockdown. Boris Johnson saidpeople were shielding before, they must begin shielding again. They will receive inidual letters shortly. However, itaposs thought that, practically, rules for the million-plus previous shielders remain as they currently are in Tier . The ‘clinically extremely vulnerable’ should stay at home as much as possible and should only leave for exercise and health appointments. They should not go to work eventhey cannot work from home, and avoid busy places including shops and pharmacies. But there is not a special support or food parcel package like there was in March. Contrary to reports, the shielding group is not being expanded to include blanket groups such as the over-s. Support bubbles  Support and childcare bubbles will remain as they currently are under the new lockdown. Support bubbles allow a single-adult household, or a couple with a child under one, to permanently ‘bubble up’ with one other household of any size. They can act as though they’re in the same household. A childcare bubble is where one household links with one other household to provide informal childcare - unpaid and unregistered - to anyone under .Children of orced parentsChildren of orced or separated parents can continue to move freely between both parents’ homes, as in previous lockdowns. Furlough  There is no change to furlough in today’s announcement. Employees not at work can be paid % of their usual salary up to a cap of £, a month, funded by the government. It applies to anyone who was employed on October  last year. The furlough scheme has been extended several times and currently expires on April . Parents who can be at work themselves, but have kids out of school, can be furloughed but that’s up to the employer. Unions have called for firms to “do the right thing and support parents” who can’t work due to childcare responsibilities. All non-essential shops shut  All non essential retail, hospitality and personal care services must shutnot already, and remain closed. Essential retailers which include supermarkets, pharmacies, garden centres, and buildersapos merchants may stay open. All pubs, cafes and restaurants shut - and takeaway pints banned  Restaurants, cafes, pubs and other hospitality venues must shut. They can continue doing delivery or takeaway - but only for food. Takeaway pints will no longer be allowed from pubs. This is a tightening of the rules since Tier  after people got drinks and gathered outside venues. However, you will be able to walk to a pub, restaurant or other outlet and pick up takeaway food. All hairdressers and beauty salons shut  All personal care services including hairdressers, nail bars and tattoo parlours must shut. All gyms and pools shut All outdoor gyms and pools must shut. This goes further than Tier  when they could remain openthey were outdoors. Other sport Outdoor sports venues including gyms, tennis courts and golf courses must close. Outdoor team sports will not be permitted.Elite sport - such as the Premier League - will continue.PE lessons and sports clubs for children attending schoolcan continue.

Prison wardens discovered Leigh Anthony Gardiner lying leless on his bed. The -year-old was put on suicide watch after his June  arrest for the murder of John Pender at an Irish pub in the popular resort of Fuengirola. Acupuncturist dad-of-two John, from Shankill in south Co Dublin, was attacked with two broken bottles after asking his alleged killer to stop pestering his charity boss we Caroline McGuigan and the partner of a pal he was with. Gardiner, a chef at a well-known Costa del Sol hotel resort, was being held at Alhaurin de la Torre prison near Malaga ahead of his trial. Two investigations are now underway, an internal prison probe and a second led by police in conjunction with a local court. Well-placed sources said the death was being treated as suicide and there was nothing at this stage pointing to foul play. The insider said: “He was found leless on his bed after failing to respond to morning roll-call. “He had been dead for several hours and nothing could be done to save him.” Another added: “The death is still being investigated but everything is pointing towards suicide. He had left a note saying he was sorry to his family.”  Other sources confirmed Gardiner had been taken off suicide watch after being placed under an intensive monitoring programme when he initially arrived at the maximum-security prison. Prison workers’ association TAMPM said in a statement, identying the dead man only by his initials: “We regret to have to confirm the death of an inmate in Module Five of Alhaurin de la Torre Prison. “The -year-old foreigner L.A.G was discovered dead in his cell during morning roll call on December . “Prison workers found him lying leless on his bed when they opened the cell. “He appeared to have died several hours earlier and nothing could be done to save him. A Spanish Prison Service source added: “The separate judicial and internal Prison Service investigations are ongoing and there won’t be any official comment on the possible cause of death at this stage.” Expat dad-of-two Gardiner was arrested in the early hours of June   after allegedly attacking Mr Pender with two broken bottles while he was using the loo at the Pogs Old Irish Rock Pub. Police said at the time the Irishman was targeted after politely asking the suspect to stop bothering his we and the partner of a friend he was with. Witnesses told detectives the dead man was attacked with two broken beer bottles as he was relieving himself and had no chance to defend himself as he was stabbed several times in the neck and body. Police who happened to be passing by the pub where the crime occurred tried to save the tourist’s le but he bled to death in front of them. He was on holiday with his we Caroline McGuigan, founder of charity Suicide or Survive, and their two children Conor, then , and -year-old Amy who were not in the pub at the time. Mr Pender, a qualied acupuncturist who trained in China, was on the board of his we’s charity.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was “incredibly worried” about the South African iant after the intervention by vaccine leader Sir John Bell. A small number of cases of the more contagious African iant have made it in to the UK which is currently battling a huge surge in its own iant which developed in South East England. Sir John, regius professor of medicine at Oxford, said that of the two, “I would worry a lot about the South African strain. “The mutations associated with the South African form are really pretty substantial changes in the structure of the protein. “My gut feeling is the vaccine will be still effective against the Kent strain. I don’t know about the South African strain - there’s a big question mark about that.” Incoming flights were cancelled from South Africa after the Government detected cases of the South African iant already in the UK. Mr Hancock said the iant was a “very signicant problem”, adding: “I’m incredibly worried about the South African iant, and that’s why we took the action that we did to restrict all flights from South Africa.  “This is a very, very signicant problem... even more of a problem than the UK new iant.” If the virus does change, then it should be possible to tweak the vaccines without going through full regulatory approval. Sir John estimated that would take a month to six weeks.

Both vaccines need to be given in two doses which are now set to be given  weeks apart in a bid to give more people their first shot sooner. It is hoped the Oxford vaccine in particular will lead to tens of millions of people to be inoculated by April and drive down coronavirus cases, which would also help unlock Britain from constant lockdown restrictions. With two coronavirus vaccines now available in Britain, it has naturally left people wondering when they will be inoculated.

Alexander Parkin, , who worked on the popular Radio  show Late Junction and won nine Sony awards for his work, was first convicted of drug dealing in . Back then he admitted selling GBL to celebrity barrister Henry Hendron after the death of Hendron’s -year-old boyfriend Miguel Jimenez.Hendron was sentenced to  hours of unpaid work after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply. Parkin also faced a trial in  over claims he had been selling crystal meth, ecstasy and ‘liquid ecstasy’ GBL from his Marylebone flat - but was cleared.  But he has now admitted possession of crystal meth with intent to supply and being concerned in the supply of the Class A drug after g was found in his flat on September  last year. Kingston Crown Court heard the Oxford graduate now has an interior design business, and befriends clients before inviting them to his parties and selling chemsex drugs at ‘cost prices’. It was said he was selling crystal meth for around £ a gram and not making a profit. Experts analysed Parkin’s phone messages in which he used drug slang including ‘Fanta’ for MDMA, ‘water’ for GBL, and ‘tea’ for crystal meth. Jonathan Hardy, defending, said: “One of his character traits is warmth, love and generosity towards others. That may seem alien in the drug world.” Judge Jonathan Davies replied: “This is exceptional, doing it out of generosity.”  The court heard police arrived at Parkin’s south London flat after finding evidence on another suspect’s phone that he had been drug dealing. A specialist search team found g of methamphetamine hidden in the flat “within home-made concealments”. Prosecutor David Povall said: “It is accepted that Mr Parkin himself is a drug user, an addict. “The people he engaged with are not only known to Mr Parkin but many of them are known to each other as well. “It is a networked supply situation which takes place within the inidual’s own social lives.”The prosecutor said there was “some” financial motive but there were no accounts to estimate a profit. Parkin’s lawyer said the drugs were not sold for profit but for “pleasure” at sex parties because his client is a “party man”. He said: “The defendant can now be recognised as someone who supplied only to friends… He did not seek to make a profit beyond his own personal re-investment. “In general terms my client supplied to those who he trusted and had a degree of emotionalnot physical intimacy, and it was very much taken in the confines of his home.” "},{"url":null,"title":"exercise only allowed once day","story":"NewsExercise only allowed once a day under new lockdown as all gyms set to closeSimilar to the lockdown in March, people should ideally only exercise outdoors once a day and should try and do this in their local areamirrorShareCommentsByDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video boris-johnson-explains-new-lockdown-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Similar to the March lockdown, the guidance announced by Boris Johnson this evening limits the number of times you should ideally exercise and says that people should try do this locally. Unlike in March however, playgrounds will remain open this lockdown. You can also exercise with one other person from outside your household or bubble. But although you can go for a walk or run with a person from another household, you can’t sit down and have a drink with them in the park.Outdoor sports venues including gyms, tennis courts and golf courses must also close under the latest strict rules. Outdoor team sports will also not be permitted. Elite sports will continue as will PE lessons and sports clubs for children attending school including vulnerable children and kids of key workers.The new rules will come into effect in law as soon as possible and are expected to remain in place until the middle of February. Measures apply across all of England and people who have been vaccinated are not exempt from any of these rules.It comes after Boris Johnson was given advice today showing cases rising rapidly in every part of country.Government sources earlier said the Covid- alert level will be raised to five – the highest setting.

The owner told police it was only workers in the building. But after they entered the premises they saw a group of people emerging from a back room. The owner sends them back into the darkened room and tells them to come out one by one. He can also be heard in the clip telling police: A lot of these youngsters, they donapost have a mask on and theyaposre playing dominoes. Under the current lockdown rules restaurants in Tier  are allowed to stay open for delivery and takeaways only but the Government advises people to stay home unless a journey is essential.  All  people found in the restaurant were issued with a Fixed Penalty Notice. The restaurant owner could face action as the police has referred the business to Tower Hamlets Council which could impose a fine.

In the late s, the men and women in her friendship group found they just werenapost meeting people who took their fancy, and who shared their views and ambitions, in bars and clubs - they were getting frustrated. Long before online dating became a thing, Karen had the idea of setting up a matchmaking company to bring together like-minded singletons - and  years later, sheaposs responsible for thousands of marriages and countless babies. Speaking to The Mirror, she explains: There was nothing like it around. I was in my s. A lot of my friends couldnapost meet the right kind of people so I thought maybe there is a business in it - and there was. The dating rules had changed. Women had their own careers, their own mortgages. We werenapost looking for someone to provide for us. We wanted to be independent. It was dficult to meet people in wine bars and pubs that you had something in common with. They wanted someone who had mutual respect for them, where they would be a team and not one part of the equation was more successful than the other. There was nothing for young, forward thinking professionals who wanted to take charge of their own le.Karen jumped straight into her new venture, Sara Eden, quitting her job at Buckingham Palace with enough money saved up to keep her going for a few months. She started interviewing people at her kitchen table, finding out everything she could about the singleton to find them their perfect match. She said: Iaposm good with people and I had a fantastic gut instinct. It wasnapost long before she was able to move her business into an office in Windsor and start to step things up. At the beginning, she charged singletons £ to help them look for love. For the fee, they would visit the office once a month and be allowed to pick  dates. After getting to know each inidual, Karen would try to work out who was best suited to who. Before long she was making good money, which allowed her to start advertising in national newspapers. She said: I started going to pubs and handing out business cards.People were fascinated because there was nothing like it. In those days we had to sell the concept because there was a stigma, but itaposs changed completely now. People now say they hope we can take them on. The Internet has brought dating into peopleaposs homes. Youaposre meeting people who want to be met and who want the same as you. Summing up online dating and match making services perfectly, Karen compares it to buying a house - saying that you would never look for a new home by just walking up and down streets. You find an expert who shows you the ones that are available, and go from there. Karen set up the business in September, and was invited to her first matchmade wedding in the following December, in , - Malcolm and Vicki. The couple invited Karen to their wedding celebrations, and she says it was a fantastic day. She says: I remember it like it was yesterday. He phoned me to say he was going to propose, it was lovely.Iaposve still going the wedding photo on the wall. At the wedding of another couple she set up, Karen was shocked when the mother-of-the-bride asked the vicar to call her up to the alter to be part of the official photos. A few years and two children later, the couple invited Karen to a barbecue at their house and they recreated the fun photo. One of her favourite success stories is a two-generation set up, where she matched up a couple and then introduced their son to his bride. After  years of matchmaking, Karenaposs business has come a long way but while the logistics are very dferent, her aim is the same - to help people fall in love. Sheaposs set up thousands of couples and has lost track of the number of weddings and babies that have come from her matchmaking skills. She now has a second office in Westminster and has clients around the world. She explains: The best part is changing peopleaposs lives. When people phone up and say this time last year I was by myself, and joining the agency was the best thing Iaposve ever done. Sometimes you just get a feeling about two people. You get a feeling that they are similar and they want the same things. I canapost explain it but Iaposm not often wrong. You never know who is going to walk through the door. You canapost help everybody, sometimes people are single for a reason, but by large itaposs very exciting. How many jobs can you go into in the morning and by the afternoon you might have changed someoneaposs le. Karen has seen her company change drastically through the pandemic. The first few weeks were extremely quiet and she was forced to furlough the entire team, but things started to pick up. All of a sudden it went bonkers.

Felicity explained she didnapost know where she caught it from, perhaps at a shop or because her sons, aged  and , had brought it home from school. With the positive test result coming in on Christmas Day, Felicity decided to keep a diary of how she was feeling each day, including some of the lesser-known symptoms, such as a swollen and stf neck that left her feeling like a zombie. Sharing her diary on Teesside Live, Felicity said: There are thousands who, like me, have managed their symptoms at home - so here’s my experience.Below is Felicityaposs day-by-day account of her experience of Covid-, originally published on Teesside Live. Christmas Eve - Day One In the early hours of the morning I wake up with a temperature, a shocking aching in my bones, particularly my legs and lower back, and a thumping headache. By the morning the headache spreads to my eyes - I couldn’t open them more than half way and could only look straight forward as moving them left, right, up or down, hurt the muscles behind them too much.I also have a sore throat and feel hot yet cold.We are due to meet members of my family for a festive walk with hot chocolates in the afternoon, but despite feeling like I just had the onset of flu, I didn’t dare risk it. It’s the high temperature that made me go for the covid test. The kids symptoms are much less than mine at this point, but they still had a higher than normal temperatures so we all booked a test online at Canon Park, in Middlesbrough, at .am. This was the first test we’d had. It was a seamless operation from pulling into the test centre, being handed our packs to carry out a self test, swabbing both the back of our throats and nostrils, to leaving about  minutes later. Return home and treat our symptoms with cold and flu remedy and paracetamols but still felt pretty shocking putting out the lads’ presents on the night time.  Christmas Day - Day Two Woke up feeling equally as horrible as the day before - achey bones, head ache, eye ache, sore throat, hot and cold - pretty grim. Just want to lay down but can’t obviously so neck a couple of paracetamols and continue the festivities not wanting to ruin it for the kids. The eldest son is complaining of aching in his eyes and a sore throat, while the youngest is also having trouble with his eyes hurting. Then an email pings through and the dreaded news that we’ve all tested positive for coronavirus and must isolate until January . I can’t lie I did panic. Whatwe were going to get seriously ill  Was I going to end up in hospital  Would we be able to breathe  The thoughts are the worst. But you can’t do anything. This thing is in your body now and you just have to get on with it. Paracetamol and Lemsips become our best friends from this point. I get a phone call from NHS Track and Trace asking me about mine and the boys’ symptoms, who we’ve been in contact with, where we’ve been - so that these people and places can be contacted. You wrack your brain wondering when and where you’ve picked it up when myself and my whole family has been very careful since March. I’ve been working from home, visiting Aldi or Asda once a week for the shopping, and the boys have been going to school. This was the routine for  months. The only dference is I’d had a week off work in the run up to Christmas and had visited a few more shops such as TK Maxx, Next, Matalan, and all the supermarkets, looking for last minute Christmas presents. Anyone I’d met up with, friends and family, was outside for socially-distanced walks in open spaces, like the beach or the sea front. So my best guess is its either come from school or the extra shopping visits. Anyway, back to Christmas Day, pumped full of painkillers I managed to pull off a half decent dinner and a few games before collapsing to the couch in the evening feeling utterly dire. Boxing Day - Day Three Feel worse today. This was the first day the so-called’ brain fog hit. I’d heard of this but haven’t ever experienced anything quite like it. It’s like walking round with a cloud around your head. You’re completely wiped out. You can’t think straight. Even something as simple as what you’re going to make the kids for dinner takes a whole lot of mental effort. I feel weak, can’t hold my head up. Still can’t move my eyes properly, starting to lose sense of taste and smell. Eating a sandwich for dinner and could literally be eating an old boot….you can tell you’re chewing something but you can’t tell what it is. Underneath my tongue is swollen. Can feel a coldness in my chest but daren’t think about it. Refuse to acknowledge it because it makes me panic. Sleep the whole afternoon. Wake up when the phone rings and it’s the Test and Trace people checking to make sure we’re isolating. Would love to say I’d had the energy to escape….but no.  Sunday, December  - Day Four Wake up. Feel just the same. No let up in the symptoms. Eye ache, head ache, dizzy, weak, congested, pain in chest, hot, cold, tired beyond belief. Make the breakfast - wrecked again. Back to bed. Monday, December  - Day Five Wake up. Feel just the same. Boring now. So fed up. Mental health taking a battering. Feel like I’m in a groundhog day prison. I’m a fit healthy -year-old, I don’t smoke, and barely drink. Iaposd hate to think how this could affect someone  older or in ill health. If ever I doubted the importance of self isolation or social distancing, I now know for sure it’s there for a reason. Iaposd hate to pass this to anyone. Iaposm supposed to be back at work tomorrow. Message my boss and tell him I can barely lt my head off the pillow let alone sit at a computer all day and think. Was so looking forward to being off work in the run up to Christmas. Now I’d love to be back. Tuesday, December  - Day Six Wake up. Look around. Eyes aren’t hurting as much. Do I feel better  I think I do. Oh my god I think I might feel better. Buzzing. Get up, go downstairs and make a cuppa. Mam rings to ask how I am. I tell her I think I feel a lot better. Finish cuppa. Dizziness s. Eyes start going fuzzy. Feel a bit sick. Start with a cough. My condition check was premature. Wrecked again. By am I’m back in bed. Sleep until pm. House looks like it’s been burgled. Can’t do a thing about it.  Wednesday, December  - Day Seven Wake up. Look around. Pain in eyes about the same as yesterday. My neck hurts today. Touch it and it’s so sore. Get up and look in the mirror. The glands under my jaw have swollen up like Frankenstein. Looks like I have half an apple under each side of my neck. My lips are so dry and peeling. Eyes blood shot. What an absolute state. Test and Trace ring again. Like seriously, I’m not going anywhere. Leave me alone. Sleep again until the afternoon. Wake up and despite the big fat neck I feel a bit brighter. This must be good news. I’m gonna be sorted tomorrow. New Year’s Eve - Day Eight Don’t be silly. It’s coronavirus tricking me into a  set of pretences. This is is the absolute worst day. It’s like I’ve gone right back to the beginning and any progress I’d made has gone out the window. My neck is still swollen, I’m dizzy, have a shortness of breath, I keep going so hot I feel sick, but then start shivering. I’m like a zombie, so so tired. I lay on the couch with my eyes closed but am not asleep. I’m shallow breathing - literally can’t move. Starting to get panicked thoughts now. Why am I not getting any better.

Lorna Whiston, , was forced to deliver her babies early in November to have scans and get treatment for Stage  breast cancer.Now she does not know how much time she has left with them, reports the Manchester Evening News.Lorna is undergoing treatment for the cancer at the same time as looking after newborn twins, Reuben and Arya, and her first son, Mason, who is three. The mum, from Cheshire, now wants to use her story to urge younger women to check their breasts, as the disease can develop at any age. Itaposs the second time Lorna has been diagnosed with cancer, the first being in February . I was playing with Mason, who was only one at the time, and he hit my boob and I thought it seemed a bit sore, she said. I felt it and found a lump, but I thought it was just hormonal because I was only  at the time and on my period. I had a biopsy and then on February , ironically World Cancer Day, I received my diagnosis of breast cancer. The young mumaposs treatment was vigorous she had a double mastectomy with reconstruction the following month, froze her eggs and six months of chemotherapy. After finishing her final round, Lorna rang the bell at Christie Hospital in Withington to signy the completion of her treatment on August .  When she turned around, she saw that her fiancée Jonny Parkes, , was down on one knee, ready to propose. By January , Lorna had been given the all-clear after a follow-up MRI which showed no evidence of cancer. However at the beginning of May, she says she had a aposfunny feelingapos and decided to take a pregnancy test, which came back positive. A scan three weeks later revealed she was having twins. She said: You arenapost supposed to try and get pregnant in the first couple of years after chemo, and it was an accident, but a good accident! Chemo can make you infertile and thataposs why I froze my eggs, and after you get told that you are probably going to be infertile itaposs all you can think about.  But we fell pregnant naturally, and twins were even more of a shock - I released two eggs but there arenapost any other twins on my side of the family. I was so excited and overjoyed, and both mE and Jonny felt blessed, like it was meant to happen. Her pregnancy continued normally until after five months Lorna started getting breathless easily, even after just going up the stairs she would want to sit down. She said: I thought it was just down to it being twins at first, but then in November I developed a little cough. The cough quickly got worse and after three days I struggled to get to the end of a sentence when reading a book for my son. Jonny rang , and Lorna was worried it could be Covid, so they went into AE on November  where an X-ray was taken of Lornaaposs chest. She said: They thought my aorta could be enlarged, which is dangerous for the babies, so they did a CT scan to rule it out and that was when they saw there was a mass just above my collarbone. Even though they couldnapost confirm anything, I immediately thought the worst and was a bit upset. Itaposs hard to hear it a second time once youaposve been through it all once.  After a couple of days in hospital and a biopsy, Lorna decided to have the babies early in case she needed to go ahead with cancer treatment. She said: They didnapost confirm it was cancer but they had a pretty good idea, and wanted to do a full body CT scan to check for any more masses so had to get the twins out. It was all a bit of a blur- we were rushing around to get things ready for the twins, but the decision to give birth early was a quick one because weaposd been thinking about it ever since they found the lump. Just one week after her biopsy, Lorna gave birth to her twins on Monday  November by emergency C-section. Reuben and Arya were premature, born  weeks and  days along, at lb oz and lb oz respectively and were taken to the neonatal ward for care. She said: I was so relieved because they said they might not come out crying as they were so young, but they did, which was the best thing. Lorna had her full-body CT scan the day after giving birth and, just four days later, was told her breast cancer had ed but this time it was at Stage  and terminal. She said: Itaposs hard, I have days where itaposs all I can think about whether Mason and the twins will even remember me because theyaposre so young. I worry the affect it will have on Mason because heaposs not old enough to understand, he just thinks mummyaposs poorly. Lorna, from Crewe, is four weeks into her treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and friend have launched a fundraising campaign to help her complete her bucket list. So far almost £, has been raised to help the young family buy a house, go on holiday - and for Lorna and Jonny to finally get married. She said: I want to marry Jonny, which we originally cancelled in order to have the twins but now weaposre bringing it forward and will have a proper party once the restrictions have eased! We really want to put a deposit down on a house to make some memories in and also offer a bit of security for Jonny and the kids, but I also want to go round the world feeding giraffes! Friends are also planning on walking  miles from Crewe to Chester in order to raise awareness."},{"url":null,"title":"primary school employs puppy help","story":"NewsPrimary school employs puppy to help pupils struggling with coronavirus stressStephanie Armstrong, Headteacher at Salusbury Primary School in London, brought Kobe into the school to offer the children some stability during these \"testing times\"mirrorShareCommentsByPaige HollandShowbiz Audience Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsHeadteacher Stephanie with Kobe \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Our free email newsletter sends you the biggest headlines from news, sport and showbizWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

So she and the rest of the team at the school decided to bring Kobe, an adorable support dog in to help the children when they’re feeling stressed or sad during their school week - and now they canapost wait for Kobe Time. Stephanie said: We’ve seen a really positive response to Kobe, the kids really enjoy seeing him walking around the school grounds. Over the course of this year, we have had a huge focus on not just their educational goals, but also their general wellbeing day to day – getting a support dog seemed like a great option to do that. We did a lot of hunting around for a dog that we knew would be safe around the kids, thinking about temperament and background and we finally found Kobe and knew he was the dog we needed. One of the best parts of having him around is seeing the kidsapos faces when he comes to their classroom, it just gives the kids such a lt. We started a new reward system where they could win Kobe time, which is a personal or group session with Kobe where the kids get to know him and spend time with him.  It’s been such a testing time for our students, with children and families managing a number of changes outside school, so having their teachers, classmates and Kobe here has offered some stability. She continued: The kids know that Kobe will usually be at the gate in the morning to welcome them and wave them off at the end of the day. Making sure Kobe was well looked after was very important to us, he has his own timetable and sees the kids after he has slept, eaten and had time for himself. He’s a really playful pup so he settled in with the kids instantly, we’re so happy with how he has adapted to his new job. He can help in many ways, when a child is upset and needs some attention Kobe is first in line, and he’s happy to play with kids who are due a reward for doing a good thing for a classmate or doing well with schoolwork.  He has changed the vibe at the school, there’s new excitement in the halls knowing that Kobe has been trotting around the place. Kobe isn’t a support dog in the traditional sense, there is more formal training he’ll need before he’s qualied like that but the emotional support he is already offering has been incredible. He can change the mood of a room just by walking in it, and in times like this sometimes it’s that moment of energy he can bring that the kids need to feel happier about the day. Now, knowing how well Kobe has settled into Salusbury school, Stephanie is sure it’s something that schools could do nationwide.

When the -year-old bride stepped out of her carriage and walked up the steps of St Paulaposs Cathedral, the world was in awe of her statement dress. The stunning ivory silk taffeta and antique lace gown featured more than , pearls and a long train. However, there was one person who wasnapost happy when she saw the dress on the wedding day - the woman who designed it. Elizabeth Emanuel and her husband spent months creating the royal wedding dress, going to extreme s to ensure the design remained secret. Speaking during ITVaposs Invitation to the Royal Wedding, Elizabeth admitted being horried when she saw how creased Dianaaposs dress had become. She said: We did know it would crease a bit but when I saw her arrive at St Paulaposs and we saw the creasing I actually felt faint. I was horried, really, because it was quite a lot of creasing. It was a lot more than we thought.  They had done a dress rehearsal but using a dferent material, and it wasnapost anywhere near as bad. But she now says that looking back, that moment was actually her favourite shot of the Princess in the dress, comparing it to a caterpillar coming out of a cocoon and becoming a butterfly. As well as the famous dress, David and Elizabeth created a second, back up dress in case the main one was leaked. David told  People : At the time we wanted to make absolutely sure that the dress was a surprise.We didn’t try it on Diana. We never even discussed it. We wanted to make sure that we had something there it was for our own peace of mind, really. So Diana never even saw the second dress which was made from the same fabric as the first and also featured ruffles around the neck.  However there were a few big dferences between the two. The secret dress was a lot less lavish than the original version, lacking the antique lace and , mother-of-pearl sequins as well as the -foot train. It was also never completed as it wasnapost needed in the end. As Diana was ft , exactly the same height as Charles, she decided to wear low-heeled shoes on her wedding day so she wasnapost taller than him.

If you look at the numbers, thereaposs no question that weaposre going to have to take tougher measures and weaposll be announcing those in due course, the PM said. Weaposve got the virus really surging. Matt Hancock today refused to rule out a third national lockdown as he faces mounting calls to act now to curb coronavirus. The Health Secretary said “we donapost rule anything out” as Labour told Boris Johnson to impose new curbs today.

Charlotte Greedy, , from Pontyclun, Wales, said when she first bought the rundown property it was filled with aposfags and drugsapos before she put her talents towards redesigning it. In search of a aposfresh startapos and with a shoestring budget the mum, who lives with her partner Harriet Waite, , and her two children, Enzo, , and Brody, , spent two years transforming the filthy tip into a dream home. Speaking of the end result she said: I love the outcome of what I’ve achieved here, it’s a great feeling knowing I have accomplished that when I had nothing to my name two years ago. “Everything I’ve done and continue to do is for my two little boys, I’ve worked my socks off to provide them with what we have now. Charlotte previously made headlines a year ago when she transformed a tiny space into a dream bedroom and play area for her young son for just £.She also completely redesigned a run-down, dingy bathroom for less than £ using eBay and BM Bargains. In a video clip of her latest project, she shared incredible before and after photos of the property, which she claimed was a pit of drugs, cigarettes and trash when she first bought it. After throwing herself into the project the home is now unrecognisable.She said: I’ve always had a passion for DIY and trying to do it on a budget where I can. “I’ve searched Pinterest since I was a kid and loved watching other people’s transformations, which then led to me doing my own. “I did the decorating all by myself. I couldn’t afford to renovate my kitchen and bathroom fully when I moved in, so I did them both on a budget. In redesigning the home Charlotte had to source budget materials to renovate her property at minimal cost, hunting for bargains wherever possible.  For the kitchen and bathroom, which cost around £ in total, Charlotte used vinyl flooring from BM and fastened it with spray glue. She also painted the tiles and kitchen worktop, as well as applied stick-on tiles to some surfaces and she ripped out old cupboards and shelves, adding a matte grey finish.

It came as coronavirus hospital deaths rose to  today - the highest Monday increase since April- with , new infections.The tougher restrictions follow mounting pressure on the government after an increasing number of hospitals struggle to cope with the overwhelming amount of Covid- infections. The new lockdown will mean weddings are banned and will only be permitted in exceptional circumstances. The tough restrictions, which come into place at midnight, means thousands of couples who have either pinned their hopes for a wedding in the near future or had already been forced to postpone their nuptials must now reschedule yet again. Under the tighter rules exceptional circumstances would apply to a couple where one or both of them are terminally-ill. Funerals and any linked events are all subject to a -person cap. The Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches national director John Stevens spoke out when a blanket ban was put on weddings across England in November. He said: In the context of Covid where people are dying and really struggling with mental health, cancelling a wedding might seem small by comparison. But the organisation that has gone into planning weddings and the financial cost... and itaposs actually a really serious issue particularly for couples who are Biblical believing Christians.

He was usually always right about everything.“Listen,anybody stepped out of line he would come down on you like a ton of bricks.“But, as a group, we weren’t like that. We stuck together as players and we are still all mates.“Deep down, there was real respect for Jim because we, more than anybody, knew what a great manager he was.”Holt also highlighted how McLean even enlisted his we Doris to help build a family atmosphere at Tannadice.He said: “Doris would take our wives out for a meal every so often and they would all have a great time.“It was a lovely gesture and the players all appreciated it.“I know it was Jim’s idea and his way of bringing everyone closer together. He was also the one who footed the bill.”Holt recently visited Tannadice to view the tributes to McLean that have been left at the stadium.He added: “It was really nice to see how many people had taken the time to go down and pay their respects.”BLETHER: Dundee photo from archives featuring Jim McLean, Jocky Scott and Bobby Cox and more Sunday Welfare AFA memories\" title\"#BLETHER: Dundee photo from archives featuring Jim McLean, Jocky Scott and Bobby Cox and more Sunday Welfare AFA memories# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp jim-mclean-jocky-scott-bobby-cox-dundee-fc-united-blether-with-brown embed # secretzeTDQwVtq\" data-secret\"zeTDQwVtq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data  ,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\":This offer will auto-renew annually at the price of  ua.. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-pack-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":,\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-mf\":This offer will auto-renew monthly at the price of  ua., you can cancel at any time. n\",\"free_trial\":true,\"plan_ids\":[\"cancelation-offer-evening-telegraph-web-epaper\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-annual-january-sale\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack--month\",\"evening-telegraph-web-pack-mf\",\"evening-telegraph-web-and-epaper-mf\"],\"subscribe\": ua. per month  u recurring subscription n\",\"label\":\"\",\"highlight\":,\"recurring\":\"\",\"has_multi\":,\"editions\":true,\"durations\":true,\"free_trial\":,\"benefits\":[\"Enjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.\",\"Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

","title":"tightening level four restrictions what changes could the first minister announce in mondays covid 19 statement","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will announce further measures to tackle a #rapid increase# in Covid- cases to parliament on Monday.In a statement released on Sunday, Ms Sturgeon said the country must take #all steps# to slow the spread of coronavirus cases while vaccination of the population progresses.The SNP leader warned just before Christmas that the country was facing a virus that spreads #much faster# than it did in March.She added that the government was considering whether the current level four restrictions covering mainland Scotland, which were #not as stringent as the March lockdown#, would be #sufficient# to tackle the spread of the new, faster-spreading iant of the virus.Under level four restrictions, which were intended to be in place for three weeks from Boxing Day, non-essential shops have had to shut while bars, cafes and restaurants are only allowed to provide takeaway services.We take a look back at some of the measures introduced during the March lockdown, and statements made by the Scottish Government in recent days, to assess what further action could be announced on Monday.Under the current regulations, people must keep journeys within their own local authority area to an #absolute minimum#.The stay at home advice is currently guidance but speaking just before Christmas, the first minister said this could be backed up by law in a move similar to spring time.In March, stringent limits were put in place which meant people could only leave their homes to shop for #permissable reasons#.These included:Under the level four regulations, people must, by law, remain within their local authority area unless they have a reasonable excuse to travel to another.This includes for work purposes, for school or for healthcare.In a statement released on Sunday, the first minister urged the public to stay at home #as much as possible# and to #avoid non-essential interactions with other households#.Schools were due toto face-to-face learning on January  but Ms Sturgeon said last week that this was under review.Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the government#s education recovery group will meet on Monday morning in advance of cabinet to consider the current advice in relation to schools and learning.It is expected that tomorrow#s announcement will almost certainly mean a further delay to theof schools into February.Speaking on Wednesday, the first minister said she wanted to osee schoolsnormally on January  as planned but would be assessing the #up to date situation# over the next few days.She added thatthere were any changes these would be set out #as early as possible# to give parents and teachers #as much notice as possible#.From Boxing Day, all of mainland Scotland was placed into level four restrictions, with the islands moving to level three.Shetland, which remains in level three currently, was facing a potential move to level four restrictions after a recent wave of Covid- infections.One of the options which remains available to ministers is to introduce a nationwide lockdown, similar to March, in which every part of country is under the same stringent measures.No one in Scotland is permitted to visit other households indoors but there are exemptions for those who have formed extended households, to support informal childcare arrangements and for couples who do not live together.Under current restrictions, a maximum of six people from two separate households can meet outdoors in a private garden or in a park.During the first lockdown in March, it was not permitted to meet up with other households even outdoors.Shielding was initially put in place in March to protect those at greatest risk of severe complications from coronavirus from contracting the virus.The national advice to shield has ended and those who were in that category should follow the same advice as everyone  in their local council area#s protection level.Even in level four areas, there are no restrictions on socially distancing from people in the same household and it is possible to do unlimited amounts of exercise.The Scottish Government has said in its guidance that #small changes# to the infection rate will not affect this advice.However, they said people within this category may be asked to take #extra steps# to stay safethere is #an increase in infection rates that gives us concern#.Should this happen, the Scottish Government will inform iniduals of this via a letter and through the text messaging service.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_sub_data

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Naturally, this would not be the last time an IndyRef would be brought up this year.On January , the UK confirmed its first two cases of Covid-.FebruaryBy February , the forthcoming coronavirus pandemic seemed a million miles away ndash with only three cases confirmed by this point.Attention instead was on Storm Ciara ndash a powerful and long-lived cyclone which battered parts of the country with gusts of up to mph.Flooding and heavy wind caused damage to buildings and train services, and on February , a -year-old man died after falling on icy surfaces and banging his head during the storm.Another major news story to unfold in the last year was surrounding former finance secretary Derek Mackay MSP.Once tipped to become the next First Minister, the Scottish Sun revealed the now shamed politician had been pestering a -year-old schoolboy on social media.The paper reported the -year-old MSP had contacted the boy out of the blue without knowing his age the previous August, then sent him  messages over six months.MarchThen came March ndash a month that can only be described as the month coronavirus pandemic really hit home in Scotland.On March , Scotland had its first confirmed case of the virus in the NHS Tayside, followed soon after by its first death on March .By March ,  cases had been confirmed in the country, with the virus clearly beginning to spread into other health boards.The inevitable news then came ndash with all pubs, cafes and restaurants being forced to close on March , before a nationwide lockdown on March .On the same day, Alex Salmond was cleared of sexually assaulting nine woman while he was the First Minister.As the BBC reports, a jury found the former SNP leader not guilty on  of the sexual assault charges facing him, while another was found not proven.A further charge of sexually assaulting a th woman had previously been dropped by prosecutors.

UK citizens will be allowed to stay in the EU for  days in any -day period without a visa, and the same will apply for EU citizens in the UK.The European Commission says the choice to end free movement ldquoinevitably means that business travel between the EU and the UK will no longer be as easy as it currently is.People heading from the UK for business have been told by the Government to check the requirements of the country they are travelling to.British passport holders will no longer be able to use the EU passport queue at airports and other borders.Will I need a visa for my holiday From , you will have to purchase a pound visa-waiver for holidays and short stays.UK nationals will not need a visa for short trips to EU countries theyre just going on holiday.But they will have to pay for a visa-waiver ndash this will cost euroand will be issued under the European Travel Information and Authorisation System.Can I work in the EU From  onwards you may need extra documents to work or study, or for trips longer than  days.Details of this have yet to be confirmed and it will likely depend on what you are doing and where you are going.But those going to work or study abroad, plus those just going on business trips, might be affected from January , , onwards.Will I need a blue passport No, your current passport is still eligible.Pre-Brexit, you could travel to EU countries on your passport right up to the point it expires ndash and that willcontinueto be the case this year, and will be until the end of the transition period on December .However, next year, the rules are changing.These changes were announced prior to the trade deal and arent expected to be affected by it.Under the new rules, fromJanuary , , when you visit most EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, your passport will need to have at least six months left on it until expiry and be less than ten years old on the day you travel.Will security change The UK will lose access to a iety of key EU databases - used by the police- covering things such as criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons.However, the UK will still have access to other systems which include cross-checks on fingerprints across Europe. This means that security co-operation will no longer be on ldquoreal-time access.The UK and the EU have reached an agreement on extradition, and the UKs role in Europol, the cross-border security agency, allows it to sit in on meetings but not have a direct say in decisions.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was \"absolutely confident\" the deal \"protects our police co-operation, protects our ability to catch criminals and to share intelligence across the European continent in the way that we have done for many years\".What about fishing The value of fish being caught by the EU in UK waters will be reduced by % and will be phased into transition over a five-and-a-half-year period.Once the transition period is over, the UK will fully control access to its waters and could make much deeper cuts.What is the impact on EU citizens living in the UK While Brexit affects everyone in the UK, the most immediate direct impact is on the . million people living here who are citizens of other EU countries.If you are a European Economic Area or Swiss citizen living in Britain, you wont have to leave the UK because weve left the EU.

This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.\"The First Minister added: \"Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.\"The decisioncomes as cases of Covid- have dramatically risen across the country, with, new positive cases announced today.Heres the key points from todays announcement:Stay at home messageFrom tomorrow,you live in a Level  areayou cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose - much like back in March.This means when you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Schools will stay closedNicola Sturgeon confirmed that schools will stay closed until February  for the majority of pupils.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.Ms Sturgeon said: \"I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.\"However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.\"First, the overall level of community transmission is too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.\"The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.\"We, therefore, have to adopt a cautious approach.\"So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.\"This decision will be reviewed on January  whether they canto school on February .Meeting people outdoorsFrom tomorrow,the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.Previously, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, the Scottish Government willconsider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to -year-olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the twopeople from twohouseholds rule.Working from homeAnyone who is able to work from home must do so.It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to workthat work cannot be done from home.The Scottish Government are asking people and businesses to take this \"really seriously\" because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level .Every business is being asked to look again at their operations and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Shielding advice changesIf you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.Hospitals near capacityNicola Sturgeon confirmed that thetotal number of Covid- patients in hospital is close to its April peak.In terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid- capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, GreaterGlasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to twoweeks ago.Other restrictions will also come into effect includingplaces of worship closing,no wakes, two-metre distancing in canteens and further premises closing.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.What help will be provided Grants areavailable for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions.

Clearly, we will stay closely involved and be seeking the best possible outcome as we have done in the past.’TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGOSpy camera scheme takes a step forwardThe group planning to set up a town centre security system in Campbeltown is considering applying to the government for funding.The Scottish Office has just made £ million available to pay for , new closed circuit television cameras to help fight crime in Scottish towns.The driving force behind Campbeltown’s proposed system, Kintyre Crime Prevention Panel, recently received an estimate for the cost of installing a system from a leading security firm. Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Bake some goodies to bring in the bells with, such as traditional Scots tablet or shortbread.Zoom have lted their -minute time limit across the New Year period, so set the camera at the bottom of your table and invite however many guests youd like!A tradition throughout Scotland on Hogmanay, the normal act of first footing will certainly be missed this year, but there may be a way to salvage it.Traditionally, first footing involves the first person who enters the house after midnight bringing gts. It has been adapted through the years, and some now visit neighbours with a tipple and a song before moving on to the next house.While were not allowed in other peoples houses this year, we can certainly adapt the tradition.Ask one of your household to draw the short straw and brave the cold just after midnight and emulate a first footing with your immediate bubble. Or, have a virtual first footing, and make sure to call your loved ones and wish them a Happy New Year.As always, there will be a raft of content available to watch on TV on Hogmanay. The official TV guide has not yet been released, but therersquoll likely be old favourites including the likes of Still Game.As ever, there will be several Hogmanay specials to help us bring in the bells from the comfort of our own home. Over on BBC One, Susan Calman will be getting ready for Hogmanay  with ldquoa studio of stars.The events that Scotlandrsquos festive season are famed for wonrsquot be going ahead in person this year. However, many are embracing a digital approach for the first time, making it easier for us to enjoy the festivities from our homes.Edinburghrsquos Hogmanay, which usually takes the form of an incredible street party with live performances and festivities, will instead be heading online. It will bring to le an exciting new piece of writing by award-winning poet and Scots Makar, Jackie Kay, creating Scotlandrsquos first-ever large-scale drone show and the largest drone show ever seen in the UK.Around  drones will create iconic images and words in the Scottish sky set to original words and music by Jackie Kay and Skyersquos Niteworks.

There was heavy traffic and, needless to say, Irsquod never driven a bus before and hadnrsquot expected to at this moment either.ldquoYou mean drive the bus  I foolishly asked.ldquoThatrsquos why you are here, isnrsquot it  he replied.I was on the bus with two other learners, as well as the instructor. We had been given some rudimentary instructions by him as hersquod driven the bus into the busy city centre, but I hadnrsquot realised we would actually have to drive the bus through busy streets.That was the first time I had driven a bus. It was, of course, an assessment of my capabilities. I negotiated as best I could and quickly learned what a tail swing was, as I nearly shaved off the nose of a woman who was standing on the edge of a pavement waiting to cross the road!The gearstick felt like it had been cemented to the vehicle, making changing gears a Herculean effort, with the engine roaring as I struggled to crunch it into gear. I drove slowly and cars began honking their horns in frustration.There was a big L on the rear of the bus, but I think when people see a bus in the city centre they assume the person driving actually knows how to drive a bus!It was a stressful  minutes and, when I finally pulled over, the instructor looked at his notes shaking his head. I cannot repeat what he said, but it was a generally negative assessment with lots of adjectives.Yet I wasnrsquot written off and was told I needed six full days of lessons as a minimum before sitting my test. Against everyonersquos expectations, including mine, I passed first time.I had done it and realised one of my lersquos dreams.There was a specic reason I needed a bus driving licence: I wanted to be a driver guide and take people around Scotland on tour. My le had undergone some dramatic changes and my le ambitions had changed as a result.It wasnrsquot, of course, about money or climbing a career ladder, but about the hopeful expectation it would make me rich in experiences and give me a new angle on le.My head and heart were full of Scotlandrsquos stories, and this seemed a perfect way to use my love of history and folklore, and share my passion for the landscape that held so many personal memories for me. I felt my le was about to be transformed and indeed it was.So that day I passed my bus driving test was a day of utter joy. Although over  years ago now, I can still feel the elation.I worked for dferent tour companies at dferent times in my le over the following  years. It was something I couldto whenever I needed it. During the last period of my time as a driver guide, a transport manager called Ronnie worked miracles as he juggled my rota to fit round my very complicated childcare arrangements. I will be forever grateful to him for his understanding.Were my expectations of the job realised or did I have an over-romanticised image of it  Irsquod say a bit of both. I tried my best to showcase Scotland, but I quickly understood people travel for dferent reasons with dferent interests.But it opened a window on the world for me. I met so many people from dferent walks of le and dferent countries and cultures. It taught me so much about the way humans behave towards each other and how we handle and respond to experiences in dfering ways.We were all on mini le journeys together, usually three days, sometimes five. In this brief fleck of time, a small group of people would be together amidst the splendour, and sometimes challenging conditions, of Scotland. When connections were made, it was because of shared values, regardless of cultural dferences.I began to see the tours as a metaphor for the way we live our lives, not just in observing others but myself as well. I had never thought the job would be a lesson on the philosophy of le, but that is partly what it became for me.It revealed to me that happiness, enjoyment and appreciation is a default within us, not something to be found, bought or acquired, or even weather dependent!That now seems so obvious but it took years for me to truly understand how we can become so easily trapped in the hedonic treadmill. I know thatrsquos a fancy term, but its meaning is simple: that as we go through le, we quickly take things for granted and so seek new and higher levels of satisfaction which we believe will give us happiness. While we can get a rush of pleasure and satisfaction in new things or experiences, we soon then take those for granted as well. So the cycle continues. We become like dogs chasing our tails in pursuit of what we think will make us happy or give us a more fulfilled le.The tours taught me that appreciation is the key to this. You donrsquot have to be a tour guide to learn this lesson, of course, as we all have our lersquos experiences that teach us. But that treadmill is so easy to fall into, even when you know it offers a  dawn. It can take a conscious effort to climb out of it.That is when we need what is called a hedonic reset: another fancy term for stopping that chase of our tail and taking time to appreciate what we have. This can be done by temporarily depriving ourselves of things we take for granted and so regaining our appreciation of them.A simple example could be when we go camping. I love it, but when I get home I appreciate my bed, my shower and central heating in ways I didnrsquot before we left on our camping trip!The virus has forced a reset on all of us it has taken away many things we took for granted: travel, staying with friends, family meals, a coffee and blether with a friend, hugging loved ones, being with loved ones, browsing in a bookshop. We will all have our list.It has been heartbreaking, with devastating consequences for so many peoplersquos livelihoods and emotional wellbeing, as well as a tragic loss of le.Itrsquos an unwanted, brutal and forced reset, but the le lesson I learnt on the tours has helped me understand that appreciation is the key to resilience and getting through this as best as we can.When times relax, as they hopefully will soon, I know how much I will appreciate hugging my daughter I havenrsquot been able to hug for  months, being able to tell stories to a live audience and have a coffee with a friend in a real cafe. And travel to the places I love within my own country.Perhapsthere is any positive out of this, I hope it will be that I will never again fall into that treadmill of taking things I have for granted.So I say Happy New Year to you, and I mean it in a heartfelt way I never meant before."},{"url":null,"title":"vet-column-consider-welcoming-new-pet","story":"ONCE your new puppy or kitten has settled into your household, there are several things to consider, ensuring your new pet is kept fit and healthy.Register with your veterinary surgeon.

Boosters are given annually against cat flu, feline enteritis and feline leukaemia.Rabbits can be vaccinated against myxomatosis and rabbit haemorrhagic disease , of which there are two strains.

Poppy is a Jack Russell cross Chihuahua, so is a very small pup. However, Poppy arrived with diarrhoea and very dehydrated, weighing only a few hundred grams.Poppy was examined by vet Chris Monk, who immediately saw how ill little Poppy was.Mum had bought her in all good faith from a family home. It was soon discovered that Poppy had been microchipped and had a vaccination in Eire. Poppy was an import from Eire, a victim of the illegal puppy farming trade.It is so dficult for new owners to know the origin of their pup, especially when the sellers can seem so plausible. Ask to see the parents or at least the mother and other pups in the litter, although they find many ways to circumvent these questions. It is also so dficult toa puppy or kitten once you have cuddled them and instantly fallen in love.The good news is that Poppy, after fluid therapy and medications, and lots of loving care from Dunedin Vets staff and, of course, his forever mum, has made a full recovery and is developing her own special character.We must also consider other preventable conditions which our pets may be susceptible to.Most puppies and kittens are born with a roundworm infestation. Worms are passed to them before birth by their mothers and through motherrsquos milk. This is obviously not very pleasant and potentially these worms pose a risk for humans, especially children.Tapeworms are rarely a problem in puppies and kittens, although one type is actually transmitted by fleas.We recommend worming puppies and kittens at eight,  and  weeks of age with a quality wormer in tablet or liquid form, which will kill most worms.Remember, there may be no obvious signs of worm infestation.Worming should be carried out every three months for the rest of your petrsquos le.Many puppies and kittens arrive at their new home with a population of external parasites. These include fleas and mites.Fleas are passed from one animal to another. Although there are dferent types of dog and cat fleas, they donrsquot mind what they jump onto to feed!Fleas are two to three millimetres long and move quickly through the coat. Flea droppings are black and gritty, and turn reddamp cotton wool is applied to them.Fleas can transmit several diseases, cause allergies and general irritation. Fleas live on your pet, and in the house.You must use a suitable insecticide spray to destroy flea larvae, which can survive for months in the environment. Your veterinary staff can advise what is best for your pet and your home.The rabbit flea is unusual in that it doesnrsquot move very fast. They are often found along the edge of catsrsquo ears and are dficult to remove, so are called lsquostick tightrsquo fleas. Cats pick them up when hunting wild rabbits.Walking dandruff mitesare very common in puppies, kittens and bunnies. They are too small to see but occasionally skin scurf appears to move, which is actually the mites, hence the name.Mange mitesare minute parasites which bury into the skin. Some are passed from mother to young and some spread from pet to pet. Some cause intense scratching, some cause hair loss. Some can be very dficult to treat, requiring specialised anti-parasitic washes or spot on treatment.Ear mites live in the ear canals, causing irritation, lots of wax production and a smell.At Dunedin Vets, we strongly recommend taking out insurance for your pet at a young age. Many breeders will provide initial insurance cover, and many vets will offer free insurance with certain companies for a few weeks. This gives peace of mind whilst you are considering which insurance to purchase. We suggest you look for a lsquolelong coverrsquo policy so your pet will always be covered.Consider a pet health club for your new arrival. Many veterinary practices, including Dunedin Vets, offer this type of scheme. Basically, you spread the cost of your petrsquos preventative healthcare over the year rather than being faced with large bills at booster time, so allowing you to budget monthly for this.Dunedin Vetsrsquo pet health club offers many other benefits and discounts. During these dficult times, many people are finding this a great way to ensure the best care for their pets without burdening themselves financially.Puppies, kittens and bunnies bring so much love to a family and help so much in your wellbeing ndash choose wisely, and look after them well, and you will have a friend and companion for le."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-december-29-31-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoPLEASE drink up... the pub is on firersquo was a headline in the East Lothian Courier on December , .Time was called early at the Auld Hoose pub in North Berwick last Wednesday after a fire broke out in the public bar.Customers spotted smoke coming from the floor near a fireplace about pm and the local fire brigade was alerted.The premises were evacuated ndash including an upstairs flat occupied by Jean Borthwick and her Labrador dog, Freeway ndash as landlord Ian McMinn tried to tackle the blaze with a fire extinguisher containing powder.But help was soon at hand in the shape of his brother Hugh, a local fireman, and the rest of the retained crew who began fighting the dense smoke and flames.Sub-officer McMinn explained that cracks in the old hearth at the pubrsquos real fire had caused joists and beams on the floor to burn.AN EAST Lothian pupil became the first from his high school to be accepted to study at the University of Cambridge, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .Ian Graham, son of Sergeant and Mrs Graham, Tranent, has been accepted for entry into Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in October .Ian is at present in his sixth year at the Ross High School.He was Dux of the School in his fth year and is at present Head Boy.He is a young man of high intellectual ability but at the same time he is an accomplished games player, playing in the School XV and also in the Badminton Club.He is an office-bearer in the Literary and Debating Society and last summer was a gold medallist in athletics at the Scottish Schools Athletics Championships.A MAN was fined pound after being caught stealing a bird from a train station, as reported in The Haddingtonshire Courier of December , .In the Burgh Court, on Friday, before Bailie Main, James Kelly, railway porter, Church Street, Haddington, pleaded guilty to having, on Tuesday, st, stolen a cockerel from a hamper lying in the booking-hall of the station.The Fiscal stated that, about eight orsquoclock on the night in question, a booking-clerk heard a person entering the booking-hall on tip-toe.On going out, he found Kelly alongside the hamper.He made the excuse that the label had been torn off the hamper, and that he was putting it on.The label was afterwards found lying on the floor, but it was discovered that the hamper had been opened and the cockerel removed."},{"url":null,"title":"7am-wait-worth-mum-bonnie-babies-champion-2020-harris-tait","story":"Harris Tait, who celebrated his first birthday on December , was announced as the winner in last weekrsquos Courier.He lives on East Lintonrsquos Longstone Avenue with mum Kirsty, , and dad Andrew, , a maintenance team leader at Torness Power Station.Kirsty described Harris as a ldquofunny and cheeky little boy with ldquosuch a little personality.She added: ldquoHe knows what he wants and is a determined little guy, which I think he takes from me and Andrew.Kirsty, who has been on maternity leave this year but is ing to work on Monday as a customer trade manager at Asda in Livingston, said Harrisrsquo win had been a boost to the family after what has been a tumultuous year.She said: ldquoItrsquos not really been the greatest year and hersquos not been able to interact with other kids and I thought, lsquoWhat have we got to lose rsquo so decided to enter him.ldquoYou never think that you are going to win competitions like these.When the results were announced in last weekrsquos Courier, Kirsty said she was ldquobuzzing and ldquoa bit emotional.

I will set out our decisions shortly.However, I can confirm now, in summary, that we decided to introduce from midnight tonight for the duration of January, a legal requirement to stay at home except for essential purposes. This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/11083918.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

Its right now, its happening, andwe dont sort out how we deal with the planet, were in big trouble.Do you have a favourite scene from A Perfect Planet \"I have to say, that flamingo sequence is one of the most memorable sequences Ive seen on television. Shot under extraordinarily dficult circumstances... its impossible not to identy with these poor little chicks who have to make it from the middle of this appalling lake to the edge to get away from their nest in the centre.\"Can we expect more ground-breaking cinematography \"It has been filmed so beautully, the use of drones, that is to say cameras which can take you up into the sky, and see whatever you want to see, its so skilful. And the pictures are so indelibly planted on the mind, thats what I think about actually on the whole series. My goodness, its extraordinary.\"Does climate change remain the biggest threat to the planet \"If we warm the earth to such a degree that the Arctic melts, every city in the world - every big city in the world, very nearly, will be underwater. A high proportion of the important cities in the world are built around the coast because of their ports andthe ice -the northern Arctic melts, the seas are going to rise and flood those cities.\"Thats not imagination, thats not H.G.Wells, its not science-fiction, its going to happen and we have still got a chance to stop it happening. What we have to do to persuade people thats the case... You have to say theres a very strong element in the United States that does not believe it - including the past president.\"What small change can people make that will have a big impact \"Not waste. Thats what they can do - and thats what theyll be forced to do, really. I mean, it is extraordinary how much we do waste at Christmas, simply on wrapping paper - Im as guilty as anybody. The chap who collects the refuse from this house would, Im sure, say, the amount of paper he throws away is awful - and thats true. But the sort of lush extravagance of Christmas, perhaps, is out of place at this particular moment.\"Do you feel a responsibility to educate people using the  youve created \"I sort of mistrust too much personality. Im embarrassed by my own, every time Im referred to. And Im sure that Greta [Thunberg] would actually say the same. But, its the way of things, there have to be people that speak.\"We understand why it is that a personal statement is more powerful than one thats an abstract statement or one thats not backed up... Gretas very good on this - Greta says all the time, its not me, it is the science, it is the science we must listen to and the scientists, and I absolutely agree.\"Is it frustrating to see people in power ignoring your warnings \"Rome wasnt built in a day and the whole world hasnt suddenly changed overnight, but I think in fact people are more aware internationally of the natural world as a consequence of what weve been going through than the reverse. I think thats the case.\"How did you handled lockdown restrictions \"Im very lucky. I dont have a huge garden, I dont want you to think I live on an estate. Ive got a reasonable garden and it has a pond. Since Ive lived here - which is  years, something like that, I cant remember taking three walks a day in my garden, as I did almost every day this spring.\"Did it make you more aware of the nature around you \"I was more aware this spring of flowers opening, buds forming, birds arriving, than Ive ever been, because Ive been busy - and most are. I mean, running for the tube and working in an office and I havent done that now for going on nine months, its amazing.\"A Perfect Planet, BBC, tonight at pm"},{"url":null,"title":"wines-year-six-top-drops-left-lasting-impression","story":"So many wines, so little time!

If a week is a long time in politics it is an aeon on television. The programme that originally replaced Scotch and Wry was as ready for the Fran and Anna Retirement Home as Still Game had been before it.What we came for, what we always came for in good years and bad, were Watsonrsquos impressions of the big names, of King Kenny, Sir Alex, and the first grade wallopers, led by Frank ldquoWherersquos the burdz  McAvennie. All, with the absence of Fergie, came to praise Watson for getting them just right, from McAvenniersquos child-like gleeto Sounessrsquos rather more tight-lipped testimonial There was a minibus full of well-kent BBC faces, from Cosgrove and Cowan to a new double act of Muriel Gray and Kirsty Wark , both of whom attested to Only An Excusersquos legendary ability to attract women viewers who did not give a free kick about football.As Sir Kenny said, ldquoEverybody took it in good nature. It was just fun. If you cannae laugh at yourself yoursquove got a problem, havenrsquot you Only an Excuse was indeed Scotland laughing at itself for the good stuff - the fitba craziness, the sentimentality, the inextinguishable dreams of greatness regained.Here and there, it had bravely broached the ugly stuff as well, sectarianism chief among them. The spoof of the Cadbury ad featuring a gorilla, Phil Collinsrsquo In the Air Tonight, and ldquoSons of Larkhall drum, repeated last night, still took the breath away with its daring. This was genuinely courageous comedy, the kind of material that fearful types stayed away from lest it resulted in hassle in the street . Only an Excuse got away with it because it gave both Celtic and Rangers pelters with equal gusto.If there had been more of this edgier material the show might have lasted longer. But this is the age of Frankie Boyle and Charlie Brooker, the take no prisoners era. Satire should not be greeted warmly by the world it lampoons.

The value of spending time with, and giving support to families, friends and neighbours has hit home for many, as has a renewed recognition of the wider degree to which we are all dependent on many others.That is a reminder, too, of our continuing responsibility to protect others by following the rules. It is likely to be months yet before a degree of normality s. Adjustments to how and where we work and the ways in which we interact with others will be required.In the wider public sphere, the past year has been a salutary lesson in the importance of transparency, clarity and consistency from those to whom we lend our trust to exercise authority. That has too often been a deficiency over the course of this disease, and it has unnecessarily compounded the dficulties of dealing effectively with it.It is not merely that, with hindsight, it is possible to identy catastrophic decisions, such as the release of patients into care homes without testing. We accept that the governments in Holyrood and at Westminster were dealing with an unprecedented situation and that mistakes were inevitable while much was unknown. It is also clear that ndash whatever criticisms there are to be made about the handling of the crisis ndash politicians demonstrated unanimity in declaring that their policies would be made on pragmatic grounds, in line with expert advice.But that sincerity of intent, alas, was not always translated into effective messaging. It is precisely when a number of approaches are possible, and when there is conflicting advice, that it is inadequate merely to assure the public that policy is ldquofollowing the science. The rationale, the projections and, wherever possible, the data behind decisions needs also to be transmitted in a clear fashion.For all the slide presentations and daily press conferences, there was far too much confusion. The pretence that tiers in dferent nations, ldquocircuit-breaking lockdowns, and other measures were substantially dferent from earlier restrictions may have been designed to reassure, or to suit the rules to local conditions.But in the end, it proved at best a recipe for confusion at a time when people were already inclined to chafe at continued privations. At worst, it gave some an excuse for deliberately misunderstanding the rules, as did occasions when politicians and officials north and south of the Border failed to observe rules that they themselves had imposed.Even with the realistic prospect that vaccination will halt or signicantly reduce the lethal damage that Covid has wrought, these issues will remain major challenges for government in the months, and probably for years, to come. Other areas, such as the enormous economic cost, will need to be addressed, in the words of the hymnrsquos later verse, ldquofree from error and hypocrisy.The decision of the SNP at Westminster to vote against a Brexit deal, having endlessly argued that any deal was better than none, is an example of the sort of petty partisan point-scoring that undermines efforts to rebuild. That is a shame, when the national interest ndash for nationalists and unionists alike ndash is at stake. The huge task of supporting the recovery of business, education and other fields must not be marked by the dither, delay and opacity that marked too many decisions last year, nor manipulated for party advantage.

She then published a new Independence Referendum Bill.In March , the day before Article  on leaving the EU was passed by Parliament, the First Minister formally requested the consent of Westminster to hold a referendum on Scottish independence. Theresa May said: ldquonow is not the time. The SNP lost a third of its seats in the  snap election that followed.Undaunted, she unveiled a ldquoreset timetable for indyref  which was now scheduled for the autumn of . When that didnrsquot happen she moved the dial to the autumn of , but before that date the SNP switched to supporting a Peoplersquos Vote for Brexit instead of indyref. That didnrsquot happen either. Indeed, the Peoplersquos Vote turned into a Tory General Election landslide of December . A triumphant Boris Johnson announced that he was now Minister for the Union and would reject a Scottish independence referendum for ldquoa generation.Sturgeonrsquos latest forecast is for a referendum in the first half of the new Scottish parliamentary cycle ndash meaning sometime around . You might think that after all these  dawns, independence supporters would have lost hope ndash but not a bit of it. After every deadline has been missed, support for independence has eventually ticked up.More voters than ever appear to have been convinced that Scotland should be an independent country. Some  polls have shown a majority for Yes, reaching a peak of  per cent in a Savanta ComRes poll in mid-December.Of course, that poll excluded donrsquot knows, and all recent polls have been conducted under the shadow of Brexit and latterly the pandemic. It is dficult to know just how much of this is actual support for independence and how much is down to loathing of Boris Johnson and Brexit. However, any objective assessment of the polling evidence would have to conclude that independence is gradually becoming the settled will of the Scottish electorate.This doesnrsquot mean a referendum is in the bag or even that it will certainly take place. Personally, I think the odds of a legally-binding referendum being held in the next decade are fairly remote. This is because the Conservatives now have a very solid majority in Westminster, despite losing a raft of Scottish MPs in .Boris Johnson is triumphant after his Brexit deal and will argue that there is no justication for holding a ldquoisive referendum to break up Britain at the very moment the UK is going through the complex process of rebuilding after the twin shocks of Covid and Brexit.The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, is also of this view. He is promising further devolution instead of a referendum and has enlisted one of the stars of the  Better Together campaign, the former PM Gordon Brown, to front it. That is the surest sign that, unlike Jeremy Corbyn, Starmer is not prepared to flirt with independence.So, eventhe SNP win the expected landslide in the May Scottish elections, the prospect of Westminster agreeing a legally binding referendum on Scottish independence is remote.Nor will there be much enthusiasm in Brussels for Scottish secession, now that a Brexit deal is in place. Those politicians in the European Parliament who had been saying theyrsquod changed their minds about Scottish independence were mostly playing a tactical game to discredit Brexit. Countries like France and Spain are as resolutely opposed to ldquoseparatism as ever, and are not going to allow Brussels to get involved in the internal politics of a country no longer in the European Union.Nicola Sturgeon has always said that the independence referendum has to be ldquobeyond legal challenge ndash in other words, expressly authorised by Westminster through a Section  Order.She is not interested in declaring UDI after a General Election victory or staging a wildcat referendum of the kind held by Catalonia in . That led to the incarceration of many of the referendum organisers and the self-exile of the Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont.The First Minister is the queen of caution. But that doesnrsquot mean shersquoll do nothing. Her personal popularity has never been higher following her handling of the pandemic, and the SNP has a commanding lead in the opinion polls. The FM is fully aware of just how dficult it is to win an absolute majority in a proportional parliament.But she will probably secure the support of the Greens at Holyrood for a referendum.So what happens then  Joanna Cherry MP, one of the stars of the anti-Brexit court actions, hopes that she will take on the Westminster Government in the Supreme Court,Boris refuses to accept the Scottish Governmentrsquos ldquomandate for a referendum.It is clear, under the UK constitution, that Holyrood has no power to hold a legally binding referendum on independence, but that doesnrsquot mean it canrsquot hold a consultative or advisory ballot asking the Scottish people what they want.There is a chance that the courts would agree that Holyrood has the power to hold a nationwide opinion poll.But would that make any dference  The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross, is promising to boycott any such advisory referendum and is calling on Unionists not to participate in it. Even some supporters of independence might think that now is just the wrong time to be holding a isive referendum. It could lead to a repeat of the Catalan situation in  when their referendum was condemned as unrepresentative because unionist voters refused to vote.Nationalists might say: a votersquos a vote andpeople donrsquot take the opportunity of expressing a view they canrsquot complain about the result.But it is not Holyrood they need to convince but Westminster. Boris Johnson would use a half-baked referendum result to rule out a referendum even more emphatically than before, and Keir Starmer would back him.We are in a strange limbo, therefore. There is no obvious reason to expect a Scottish referendum in the near future and yet almost everyone does. There is no politically plausible route. However, politics is very fluid right now. We live in turbulent times.Support is clearly rising and it may be that a mass movement of Scottish opinion exerts moral pressure on the Westminster establishment to change its mind. But in the meantime, itrsquos business as usual.

However, momentous as both of those events may be, we are about to face a larger one. It may seem counterintuitive ndash hyperbolic even ndash to suggest that the Scottish Parliament elections in four months time carry the same level of importance as coronavirus and Brexit, but they do.In fact, they are more important, and may have more enduring consequences than both. Thursday th May will either be the last election to a devolved Scottish Parliament before Scotland becomes independent, or it will be the last election to a devolved Scottish Parliament where independence is a signicant issue at the ballot box.This is the end game ndash a political title-decider. The field of play looks unremittingly bleak for Scotlandrsquos unionists. That assessment is not based solely on the headline polling numbers, grim as they are .It is what lies beneath that should worry unionists most. In the first referendum, in , the No vote relied on those with good jobs, good prospects and some money in the bank. Not so now Yes has a handsome lead over No in the ABC social class groupings, according to all pollsters.Gender has historically played a role in independence voting intentions, with women thought to be more risk-averse, and tending towards a No vote. No more women now lead with every pollster, in some cases by double-digits.The age profile of No voters is one of those ldquolook away now moments for unionists No leads only in the age group nearing retirement or older. Less than one-in-five under s will vote No. Should the referendum take place in , for the sake of argument, those aged six at the  referendum will be eligible to vote. Current patterns suggest almost all of them will vote Yes.There is no inevitability about this, though. The situation has arisen, in my opinion, largely as a result of push-factors rather than pull-factors. In other words, some of those who would previously have voted No have switched to Yes because of negativity towards the UK rather than positivity towards Scotland.Brexit  Boris  Covid  Probably all three, and probably a whole lot of other reasons. It is important. Many potential Yes voters are not emotional nationalists rather, they are pragmatically and clinically assessing le in an independent Scotland as being, on balance, better than le in the UK.He or she who is pushed away can be pulled back. But it will require the UK Government and its ruling Tories to make a series of radical changes which they have thus far shown themselves unwilling to do, or unable to do, or perhaps both.Truthfully, I donrsquot knowthey have it in them. I read an article at the weekend on a prominent Conservative blog in which the writer surmised that Scottish MPs could be made to like being at Westminster so much that independence could be stopped in its tracks. It was yet another ldquoDo these guys have any idea  moments, of which I experience many.There is a dference between unionist leaders and nationalist leaders. Nationalist leaders, unlike their foot soldiers, are clinical rather than emotional. They make decisions and create policy which they may personally find unpalatable, and which their supporters certainly do, because they know it will help them win Unionist leaders, on the other hand, are as emotional as the foot soldiers. They spend their time bleating about lsquoour precious Unionrsquo and concocting ious plans for how a referendum can be avoided that they never ask themselves the question: how are we going to win If they ever get around to doing so, they will understand that the answer is: by doing things we donrsquot like.The central tenet of what should become the new  of the UK Government is a great programme of decentralisation. They can call it what they wish ndash home rule, federalism, devo max, devo plus. Thatrsquos a job for the advertising agency.

It also raises several questions which Ms Sturgeon really needs to answer in , especiallyshe wants to attract more sceptical voters to her cause.This is a particularly frustrating tendency of the First Minister and many other nationalists: the idea that Scotland is uniquely dferent to other nations. Ms Sturgeon says in her article that ldquoScotland, like all nations, is unique, but what does that literal fact prove If Scotland was unique in any profound political sense, we would need a unique political system, but Scotland is largely the same as its neighbours: it faces the same problems, the same issues, the same challenges, and thatrsquos why we cede some of our sovereignty.:Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish independence has never been about separatismMs Sturgeon accepts this when she talks about the EU, so why doesnrsquot she accept it when she talks about the UK A tactic used by the SNPis to state something which is not proven and to state it frequently, loudly, and repeatedly. ldquoDevolution is under threat. ldquoA referendum will happen next year. ldquoIndependence is inevitable. And now: ldquothe majority of Scots support independence.Ms Sturgeon does it again in her article. ldquoA consistent majority of people in Scotland, she says, ldquonow say they are in favour of becoming an independent country even though we cannot knowthatrsquos true or not. The polls show a majority of those who express an opinion now support independence, but thatrsquos not the same as a majority of Scots. Around % of those questioned say they donrsquot know and you donrsquot need great statistical skill to realise % could swing the result.:Opposition needed to challenge the SNP on Scottish independence says Tony BlairSo, the question is: why is Nicola Sturgeon saying it anyway, that the majority of Scots support independence  And the answer is shersquos saying it in the hope of bringing about a three-stage process. Stage one: we believe it. Stage two: we accept it. Stage three: we support it. Itrsquos happened before and it can get parties over the line.Nicola Sturgeon loves the V word: values. The founding values of the EU, she says, are dignity, freedom, equality, the rule of law andrespectfor human rights, and these are Scotlandrsquos values too, she says. She also writes that ldquounfortunately for those of us in Scotland, we are hellip at the sharp end of a very dferent project, driven by very dferent values: Brexit.But what is she suggesting here exactly  Is she suggesting the other nations of the UK ndash specically England ndash do not support values such as dignity and freedom  If so, thatrsquos a pretty outrageous thing to say and a rather unjustied example of Scottish moral superiority. My question would be: in what way exactly are Englandrsquos values dferent from Scotlandrsquos  And in what way are ldquoScotlandrsquos values not universal values In some ways, this is the most important question because it goes to the heart of the intellectual inconsistency of a party that supports leaving the UK and joining the EU. Ms Sturgeon says that more and more people in Scotland believe our aspirations can best be met by contributing to the shared endeavour and solidarity of the EU.:Boris Johnson doubles down on once in a generation referendum claimBut what is the dference between a shared endeavour between Scotland and its neighbours across the Channel, and a shared endeavour between Scotland and its neighbours on the same island  The other obvious question is how the First Minister could justy continuing to promote independence the UK was more federal. Scotlandrsquos membership of a completely federalised UK would not, in any material respect, be dferent to Scotlandrsquos membership of the EU. In both cases, decision-making is pooled on some subjects and we do not always get our way.As she makes clear in her article, Ms Sturgeon accepts this shared-sovereignty model when talking about the EU ndash indeed, she appears to be in love with it ndash but when the same principles are applied to the UK, itrsquos a dferent story. In her article, she also suggests an independent Scotland would be a ldquobridge to aid understanding between the EU and the UK. Itrsquos the best joke in the article.The final question is the most tricky one in a way, strategically, for the First Minister. She says Scotland is the victim of a ldquohard Brexit and that there will be disruption in the short term and new barriers in the longer term. But you can sense the strain in this part of the article, and for obvious reasons.The first problem is thatyou say something will be a disaster before it happens, some people will believe you, but you canrsquot go on saying itthe disaster doesnrsquot happen. Most Scots will not notice any changes post-Brexit andthey do, theyrsquoll be small, and thatrsquos undoubtedly going to neuter the ability of the SNP to carry on catastrophising. Itrsquos why you can hear the slight beep-beep of a reverse from the First Minister and the downgrading of her language to phrases like ldquoshort-term disruption.The second problem is that Ms Sturgeonrsquos desire for a softer Brexit highlights the inconsistency running through her outlook. She is desperate to cede sovereignty to one union but take it back from another, and for many voters thatrsquos confusing. Such as Scots who voted Yes in  and Leave in .

This is similar to the lockdown of March last year.However, before I set out Cabinetrsquos decisions in more detail, I want to explain in some detail why they are so necessary.In the last few weeks, there have been two signicant game changers in our fight against this virus.One, the approval of vaccines, is hugely positive and offers us the way out of this pandemic.But the other - the new faster spreading iant of the virus - is a massive blow.Possibly the most simple way of explaining the challenge we face right now is to compare it to a race.In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they can run as fast as possible.Thatrsquos why the government will be doing everything we can to vaccinate people as quickly as possible. I will say more about that later.But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new iant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks.To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible.But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down.And because it is now spreading faster, that means even tougher restrictions are necessary.The evidence is now compelling that the new iant is up to % more transmissible than previously circulating strains, and that it may add as much as . to the R number.And according to recent analysis of PCR test samples, it appears that the new iant already accounts for almost half of all new cases in Scotland.That increased and faster spread is undoubtedly driving the very serious situation we now face.Todayrsquos case numbers ndash , new cases, with % of tests being positive - illustrate the severity and urgency of the situation.No new deaths were reported today ndash because yesterday was a Sunday and registration offices were largely closed ndash but since I updated Parliament before Christmas,  deaths have been recorded in the daily figures. That again reminds us of the continuing grief this pandemic is causing.But this is not just about one dayrsquos numbers.We are now seeing a steeply rising trend of infections.Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.In the week from  to  December, the seven day incidence of cases per , of the population increased by % - from  per , to  per ,.Test positivity has risen sharply too.The next update on the numbers of Covid patients in hospital and intensive care will be published tomorrow.I would expect these to show that, nationally, the total number of Covid patients in hospital is close to its April peak. And in some boards, the pressure is already very real.For example, in terms of hospital beds, NHS Ayrshire and Arran is currently at % of its Covid capacity, and three other health boards - Borders, Greater Glasgow  Clyde and Lanarkshire - are above % of their capacity.The number of people in intensive care is still signicantly lower than the April peak ndash which partly reflects the fact that treatment of Covid has improved signicantly since last spring.But even so, the total number of patients in intensive care in Scotland is already above normal winter levels. Indeed, all mainland health boards have now exceeded their normal intensive care unit capacity.And it is important to be clear that people who are in hospital and ICU now are likely to have been infected  days to  weeks ago.That means that these numbers reflect what the level of new cases was around  weeks ago.Given that the number of cases has increased signicantly since then, we can expect to see signicantly increased pressure on the NHS over the course of this month.Contingency plans remain in place to double and then treble ICU capacitynecessary.And the NHS Louisa Jordan continues to be available to help meet demand - as indeed it has been doing in recent months. , patients have attended there for scans and outpatient appointments nearly , NHS staff and students have been trained there and it is currently being used for Covid vaccinations.In short, NHS services are coping at present ndash although the pressure on frontline staff is considerable - but already in some areas the position is fragile, and getting more challenging.Andthe rate of increase in case numbers that we have seen in past two weeks was to continue unchecked, there would be a real risk of our NHS being overwhelmed - even with contingency plans in place.In fact, our modelling suggests that without further intervention, we could breach inpatient Covid capacity within  or  weeks.And, of course, a sharply increasing number of cases, in human terms, means many more people becoming ill and dying.All of that explains why we have to act quickly and decisively.The situation in some other parts of the UK - where case numbers are already much higher than here, and where the contribution of the new iant is already greater - shows what may lie aheadwe donrsquot.As things stand, we estimate that we are possibly about four weeks behind the position in London and the south east.The rapid acceleration in London began when it was at about  new cases a week, for every hundred thousand people. Thatrsquos the level Scotland was at a week ago.London is now seeing  new cases a week per ,. Test positivity is around %. And pressure on NHS services is acute.We have an opportunity in Scotland to avert the situation here deteriorating to that extent.But we must act quickly.The advice of our clinical advisers is clear that the increased transmissibility of the new iant means that the current level  measures may not be sufficient to bring the R number back below .It is essential that we further limit interaction between dferent households to stem the spread and bring the situation back under control, while we vaccinate more people.In short, we mustfor a period to a situation much closer to the lockdown of last March.Let me therefore set out in more detail the decisions Cabinet has reached.It is important to stress that these are not decisions taken lightly. I am acutely aware of the impact they will have and I know they will not be welcome.But they are in our judgment essential.As government, our clear and overriding duty right now is to act quickly to save lives and protect the NHS.We know that delay or preication in the face of this virus almost always makes things worse not better - evenit stems from an understandable desire that we all share to wait for more data or evidence.To turn to the decisions in detail. The decisions I will speak about a bit later on schools, let me be clear at this stage, they will apply to all parts of Scotland. However other decisions that I will outline will apply to those parts of Scotland currently at level , which of course is all of mainland Scotland, and they are effectively an enhancement to level .The island areas currently in level  will remain there for now, although we will continue to monitor them very carefully.These additional level  restrictions - essentially ing us to a position similar to the lockdown of last March - will be in place for the whole of January. We will keep them closely under review.However, I cannot at this stage rule out keeping them in place longer, nor making further changes. Nothing about this is easy.The first measure is that our fundamental advice, for everyone, is to stay at home.That is the single best way of staying safe.We consider that this stay at home message and advice is now so important that, from tomorrow, it will become law, just as it was in the lockdown last year.This means it will only be permissible to leave home for an essential purpose.This will include, for example, caring responsibilities, essential shopping, exercise and being part of an extended household.In addition, anyone who is able to work from home, must do so. It will only be a reasonable excuse to leave your home to go to work,that work cannot be done from home.We are asking people and businesses to take this really seriously ndash as we all did in March, during the first lockdown, - because the situation is at least as serious now as it was then.The law already requires many businesses in certain sectors to close in Level . We now need every business to look again at their operations, and to make sure that every singlethat can be done by people working at home, is being done in that way.Businesses have already shown a tremendous capacity to adapt during this pandemic and Irsquom very grateful to them for that - and we need them to consider their operations again, as we all work together to reduce transmissions.The Economy Secretary will be speaking to business organisations about this, including this afternoon. We will also engage with unions on these issues. And we will continue to considermore regulatory action is required.We are also providing new guidance for people who are in the shielding category.If you were shielding and you cannot work from home, our clear advice now is that you should not go into work at all.The Chief Medical Officer is writing to everyone who falls into this category, and his letter will count as a Fit Note for those who need it.Unlike the lockdown last year, the frequency of outdoor exercise is not being limited.It is important for physical and mental health that we can get outdoors for fresh air and exercise as much as possible.However, from tomorrow, the rule on outdoor gatherings will change.As of now, up to six people from two households are able to meet outdoors. Given the greater transmissibility of this new iant, we consider it necessary to restrict that further.From tomorrow, a maximum of two people from up to two households will be able to meet outdoors.Children aged  and under will not be counted in that limit, and they will also be able to play outdoors in larger groups, including in organized gatherings.However, for everyone  ndash including  to  year olds - outdoor exercise should only take place in a way which is consistent with the  people from  households rule.In addition, strict travel restrictions remain in place across Scotland. From tomorrow,you live in a level  area - as the majority of us do - you cannot leave your home except for an essential purpose. When you do go out, stay as close to home as possible and stay away from crowded places.And it remains the case ndash and let me stress this point - that no-one is allowed to travel into or out of Scotland unless it is for an essential purpose.Presiding OfficerA number of other measures will come into effect on Friday of this week.It is with real regret that we consider it necessary for places of worship to close during this period for all purposes except broadcasting a service, or conducting a funeral, wedding or civil partnership.I am well aware of how important communal worship is to people.But we believe that this restriction is necessary to reduce the risk of transmission.While up to  people will still be able to attend funeral services, wakes will not be possible during January. And a maximum of  people will be able to attend wedding and civil partnership services.Presiding OfficerI know how devastating restrictions like these are and I give an assurance that we will not keep them in place for longer than is absolutely necessary.There will also be additional measures in relation to businesses, in addition to the tightening of the essential retail definition that took effect from Boxing Day.The current  metre exemption for workplace canteens will end ndash so canteens will have to ensure that employees sit  metres or more apart, rather than  metre.The number of non-essential services which remain open will be further restricted.Premises which will need to close as a result of these changes will include, for example ski centres, showrooms of larger retailers, and clinics offering cosmetic and aesthetic procedures.I know that many businesses have already been hit by the restrictions which were put in place on Boxing Day.And of course I know that the vast majority of businesses have taken their responsibilities seriously, and have invested in Covid safety measures.In addition, the move to home working has brought challenges for workers and employers. I am hugely grateful for the way in which businesses and their staff have responded to those challenges.Grants are of course available for businesses required to close as a result of restrictions. That support is in addition to support through the UK wide furlough scheme.The Scottish Governmentrsquos financial support for businesses during the pandemic currently totals more than pound. billion.However, we will continue to assess what more the Scottish government can do ndash either in closure grants or other forms of support - to help businesses and those who work for them.We will also work with councils to ensure community and social support for those who need it, including for parents balancing work and online learning.We will confirm additional resources later this week.Presiding Officer,The final substantive issue I want to address - before giving an update on vaccination - relates to schools.We announced before Christmas that most school pupils would learn remotely ndash rather than in school ndash until Monday  January.I can confirm that we have now decided to extend that date and keep schools closed to the majority of pupils until  February. We will review this again in mid-January.The change will apply to all pupils - except vulnerable children, and children of key workers. And it includes nursery schools, as well as primary and secondary schools.There is no doubt that of all the dficult decisions we have had to take today, this was the most dficult of all and its impact is of course the most severe.The evidence to date makes clear that thanks to the hard work of school staff and pupils, schools in Scotland have been low-risk environments for Covid. We will work with our partners to ensure that remains the case.That will include ongoing work on testing in schools and discussions about when, in the context of the overall programme, it will be possible to vaccinate school staff.And I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils as quickly as possible and then keep them open.However, right now, two factors mean that it is not consistent with a safety-first approach for all children to attend school in person.First, the overall level of community transmission is simply too high. We need to get transmission down before schools can safely reopen. A period of online learning will also, in turn, help us do that.The second reason is that there is still signicant uncertainty about the impact of the new iant on transmission amongst young people.We therefore have to adopt a cautious approach at this stage.So most pupils will be learning online for at least the rest of the month.We will review on  January whether they can - as we hope -to school on the  February.I know that remote learning presents signicant challenges for teachers, schools, parents and young people, and we will work to support children and parents throughout this.The Scottish Government, Education Scotland and local authorities are working together to further improve the remote learning options which are available for schools.And it is also worth highlighting that since schools ed after the summer, more than , devices ndash such as laptops ndash have been distributed to children and young people to help with remote learning. More devices are being distributed by councils on a weekly basis, and in total we expect our investment ndashwhich builds on existing local authority action - to benefit around , disadvantaged children and young people across Scotland.I also want to stress one final point.Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown.They remain our priority.That is why we are considering whether and to what extent - consistent with our overall duty to vaccinate the most vulnerable first in line with JCVI recommendations - we can achieve vaccination of school and childcare staff as a priority. Many teachers will of course be vaccinated over coming weeks as part of the JCVI priority list.The fortnightly review will not simply be a choice between opening and closing schools - we will always seek to maximise the number of pupils we can safely get back to classrooms and nurseries.Sothe evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that.However ultimately, the best way of enabling more pupils tomore quickly is by reducing community transmission of the virus as much as possible.And all of us ndash by accepting and abiding by the wider restrictions I have set out today - have a part to play in achieving that.Before I leave the issue of education, let me remind the chamber that we already had plans in place for the staggeredof universities and colleges. We will be considering this week whether any further change is necessary.Presiding OfficerBefore I close today, I want to give a brief update on our current expectations around vaccine supply.The Health Secretary will give a more detailed update on vaccination in a statement the chamber next week.However, I can confirm today that well over , people have now received their first dose of the vaccine.The first doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine are being administered today.In total, over the period to the end of January - including the more than , already administered - we expect to have access to just over , doses of vaccine. Obviously, we hope that increases.These will be split roughly equally between the Pfizer and Astra Zeneca vaccines.However, we anticipate that some of the Astra Zeneca portion will be available only in the last week of January.We do not yet have certainty on supply schedules beyond January but will keep Parliament updated as these become firmer.However, our current expectation, based on assumptions about supply and the new advice on doses being administered up to  weeks apart, rather than , is that by early May everyone over , and people under  with specic underlying conditions, will have received at least the first dose of vaccine.That is everyone who is on the JCVI priority list, and comprises more than . million people.Once everyone on the priority list has been vaccinated, we will start vaccinating the rest of the population, and will do this in parallel with completing second doses for those on the priority list.Those timetables are of course heavily dependent on vaccine supply. And for that reason, they are at this stage cautious.However, I have tasked our vaccination team with exploring and keeping under ongoing review all options to speed up the rate of vaccination and bring these timescales forward as far as possible.I am grateful for the many offers of assistance we have received and while many of them may not prove possible or practical to take up, they will be consideredThe Health Secretary will say more about all of this in her statement next week.Presiding OfficerTo conclude, this is most certainly not the new year statement I wanted to give.And I know it is a statement no one wanted to hear.But as I said at the beginning, we are now in a race between the vaccine and the virus.The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine.But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus.We can already see ndash by looking at infection rates where ndash some of what could happen here in Scotlandwe donrsquot act.To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly.For government, that means introducing tough measures ndash as we have done so today.And for all of us, it means sticking to the rulesIt means continuing to follow the FACTS guidanceAnd it means ndash above all ndash staying at home.That is again our central message.Stay Home. Save lives. Protect the NHS.If we do this, we give the vaccine the time it needs to get ahead and ultimately win the race.I know that the next few weeks will be incredibly dficult.Irsquom sorry to ask for further sacrices, after nine long months of them. But these sacrices are necessary.And the dference between now and last March is that with the help of vaccines, we now have confidence that these sacrices will pave the way to brighter days ahead.So ndash for everyonersquos sake and safety - please stick with it and stay at home."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-teaching-unions-welcome-school-closures","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has announced that schools will remain closed until at least February  across the whole of Scotland, pointing to the high level of community transmission and lack of details over the new strain of the virus.The new strain, believed to be up to  per cent more transmissible, is now contributing to around half of the new cases confirmed in Scotland ndash while the country now has a test positivity rate of  per cent ndash three times the level set by the World Health Organization.:Coronavirus Scotland: Schools to remain shut until FebruaryMinisters will review the decision to close schools until February  in the middle of January where the closure could be extended further.The First Minister has indicated that primary schools and nurseries could re-open before secondary schools, once it is deemed safe to do so.:Nicola Sturgeon puts Scotland back into lsquostay at homersquo lockdownEIS general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said:ldquoThere was already heightened concern from teachers in level  areas around school safety and the surge in infection levels, driven by the new iant, will have compounded those concerns especially as it seems clear that children can be as easily infected as anyone by the new strain, with subsequent transmission also occurring.\"Given that social distancing amongst pupils is physically impossible in crowded classrooms, moving to remote learning is the correct decision, therefore,we are to successfully drive down community infection levels. Suppressing the virus is key to school buildings safely reopening.He added:ldquoWhilst the education system is better prepared to deliver education remotely than during the first lockdown, challenges remain and we need to ensure that all pupils, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, can access learning on an equitable basis.ldquoWe have raised with the Scottish Government the question of prioritising vaccination of school staff as a mechanism to allow school buildings to reopen for all pupils.Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachersrsquo union, said: ldquoWe welcome the First Ministerrsquos announcement that schools will remain closed to all but key worker and vulnerable children until at least February . This will provide a measure of relief to many highly anxious teachers, parents, pupils and school staff at this dficult time.ldquoWhile the NASUWT has always supported schools remaining open to all pupils as long as it is safe to do so, it is clear, as the First Minister herself has acknowledged today, that the threat posed by the new Covid iant has escalated the risks to the health and welfare of pupils, teachers and the wider community considerably and that the only safe course of action is to move to an extended period of remote education at this time.ldquoThe First Minister stated that the signicant uncertainty on the impact of the new iant on children, along with the overall high level of virus transmission in the community had guided the decision to extend the period of remote learning.ldquoIt will now be vital that in reviewing the closure of schools on January  the First Minister continues to be guided by the medical and scientic evidence on the impact of the new iant, with the priority the safety, health and welfare of children, young people and school staff. The highly cautious and preventative approach set out today must be maintained in order to protect health and welfare."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-no-question-hard-brexit-scotland-endure","story":"Mr Smith asks Ms Sturgeon to explain her comment about Scotland being unique. An odd question, seeing that he immediately grants that this is fact, but then says this doesnt mean we need a unique political system, because we are largely the same as our neighbours. Let me offer him a way to resolve this contradiction. We are similar to, but not the same as, our neighbours. Many of us believe that the UKrsquos political system is working very badly and needs profound change. So wersquod rather choose our own.He next asks why she says the majority of Scots now support independence. Because opinion polls very consistently show more people support it than oppose it. OK, this leaves out the ldquoDonrsquot knows, but in the context this is quibbling. Especially since the latest pollreports that  per cent of all respondents favour independence, with only % against.Next question: In what way are Englandrsquos values dferent from ours  A sly one, this, because thatrsquos emphatically not what the First Minister suggested. She contrasted the values behind Brexit with the collective spirit behind the collaborative international development of vaccines, a very dferent thing. This was a blatant twist of her words.Mr Smithrsquos Question  is about why Ms Sturgeon is not comfortable with a federal UK. I donrsquot know where this question comes from. She didnrsquot mention federalism at all in her article. If Mr Smith would like arguments against the federal idea, I could refer him to countless articles over recent years. Among the many convincing points they make, here are two: in a federal UK, Scotland wouldnrsquot control its own economy and on all major issues England would call all the shots.Last question: Why is she still calling this a ldquohard Brexit  Answer: Because it is. It is, because the UK Prime Minister was too weak to negotiate for any compromise for fear of his feral pack of Tory Brexiter extremists. I am sure the great majority of Leave voters ndash whose opinions I respect, though dfer from ndash would have been happy with a far greater degree of accommodation with the EU, but Mr Johnsons leadership vacuum didnt allow him to seek it. Does Mr Smith believe that what we have is a ldquosoft Brexit  Irsquod like to hear his arguments.Lyn Jones, Edinburgh EH.A TOAST TO BORIS JOHNSONCREDIT must be given to Boris Johnson for his quick action in procuring the BioNTech vaccine. The EUs cumbersome bureaucratic approval process and its cautious small order has led to a shortage in EU countries, according to the CEO of the vaccine company. No wonder German media is furious with \"EU dithering\", as inoculation centres have had to close owing to lack of vaccine in the very country where it is produced.So at the start of a new year, lets raise a toast to Mr Johnson. Now just be careful, Ms Sturgeon, that you dont choke.Morag Black, Houston.NO QUICK RETURN TO THE EUNICOLA Sturgeons bold forecast that Scotland could be back in the European Union \"soon\" as an independent stateis entirely without foundation. Indeed, in the run-up to the independence referendum in , similar claims made by Alex Salmond were very quickly countered by Juan Manuel Barroso, the then President of the European Commission.Michel Barnier has apparently made it very clear that it will take a long time before Scotland will gain access to the EU. Spain will almost certainly veto any such application lest it boost Catalonias independence expectations.Ms Sturgeon has yet to confirm whether Scotland,pressed, will join the euro. She always ducks the issue of an increasing Scottish deficit far above the EUs admissible three per cent of GDP.Sadly her forecast, lacking in substance, is simply a wish.Ronald J Sandford, Kingsbarns, Fe.HYPOCRISY OVER PRIVATISATIONJIM Dalyseems to subscribe to the notion thatyou repeat something often enough, people will believe it. Where is the evidence that the UK will \"aggressively roll back worker and environmental protections\" or that the Internal Market Bill will be used to \"open up the the NHS to privatisation\"  Has he forgotten that Nicola Sturgeon signed a deal in September  with Ascensos in Motherwell to provide contact tracers Yet another example of SNP hypocrisy.Anne Kegg, Uddingston.AUTONOMY IN THE EUSTRUAN Stevensonrsquos attempt to vindicate the Brexit deal on fishing is political blame-mongering at its worst . It wasnrsquot the SNP which made repeated promises to the fishing industry and then failed to deliver ndash it was the chief separatist, Boris Johnson. Nor was it the SNP which egged on fishing leaders from Devon to Peterhead to shout ldquobetrayal it was their disappointment at being sold a pig in a poke by the Tories yet again, a fate which will also be visited on the farming sector soon.Independence can allow Scotland to enjoy ldquosovereignty over its fishing groundswe follow the ldquoNorway Option. Joining the EU means sharing sovereignty over fishing, but with full national autonomy over a vast range of responsibilities we are denied under the hegemony of Westminster.GR Weir, Ochiltree.TAKE BACK CONTROL OF CARE HOMESKEVIN McKennas article on the elderly care sectormade uncomfortable reading.I accept business is business, but this particular business is supposed to be the provision of care for the elderly in our society ndash the elderly being those who mostly have contributed to and worried about the future generations of this country. Standards of care y too much and are probably not regulated enough. Unfortunately, being a member of the human race may entail becoming sick, old, frail and perhaps demented. The least we should expect is to provide the elderly with care, love and dignity and that onus falls on all of us. We strive and mostly succeed to provide it for our children, so what about our old people  They should not matter less.He is correct ndash we need the provision of care to be brought under the NHS with much more rigorous monitoring and where people come before profit. It is bound to cost us but it is our collective responsibility as part of a society, defined as \"totality of social relationships among groups of human beings\".I hope the First Minister and all our MPs, whatever party, make this a priority for .

Primary pupils are to be taught remotely for the week from Monday until Friday, January  as the spread of coronavirus surges.Read MoreArlene Foster: Remote learning in Northern Ireland should be for short periodBut Mr McCamphill said all schools need to be closed until February to coincide with the current lockdown.There are two aspects to closing schools, he said. There#s the transmission that occurs in schools but then there#s the associated transmission, such as children travelling on buses and parents dropping children off.If we want the lockdown to be effective, andwe want to get Covid under control, we must take all the necessary steps otherwise our health system won#t be able to cope.Mr McCamphill said he was disappointed after Mrs Foster told the BBC that keeping children in school was a priority.The DUP leader said: We will do all that we can to keep pupils in school. We do recognise that with this new mutant version of Covid- there are dficulties and it transmits among younger people, and we have to take that into consideration.However, Mr McCamphill said the DUP “need to start listening to the scientic advice and acting on it”.His comments come after all four teaching unions in England said it was unsafe for schools to reopen and called for their closure for the next two weeks.But Boris Johnson said parents should send primary-age children back to schools that are open this week. The Prime Minister also said he has no doubt that classrooms are safe and that the risk to young people was very, very small.Mr Johnson told the Marr Show: Schools are safe. It is very, very important to stress that.I would advise all parents thinking about want to do, look at where your area is, overwhelmingly you#ll be in a part of the country where primary schools tomorrow will be open.Meanwhile, Northern Ireland nursery schools leaders have urged Mr Weir to treat them the same as their primary and secondary school counterparts.In a letter, the North and South Belfast Nursery Schools Principals Group urged him to hear the voices from the sector working on the ground in these unprecedented times.They added: We urge you to apply the same safety measures around delayed opening for primary school to all nurseries and preschools, thus enabling them to offer the same essential care for key workers and vulnerable children, to minimise contact and the spread of the virus.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ecd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_dff-fa--afa-aa_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"EducationWeir has failed thousands of pupils over transfer test, says Stormont Education Committee chair Chris LyttleThe chair of Stormont’s Education Committee has said the Education Minister has failed thousands of primary school children as they prepare to sit the first transfer test on Saturday.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_b-d-b-ae-ef_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandArlene Foster: Remote learning in Northern Ireland should be for short periodRemote learning for school children in Northern Ireland should only be for a short period, the First Minister has said.Most ReadSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to discuss further restrictions as  deaths and , cases reported Heartache as bride Jade Parker bride dies just two days after her weddingHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardLatest CoronavirusUnion demands answers over reopening of nursery and special schoolsEmpty pubs and restaurants offered to help with NI vaccine rolloutMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaDUP and Sinn Fein on collision course as O#Neill adamant weekend transfer tests should be droppedCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to discuss further restrictions as  deaths and , cases reported Latest from Belfast Current Covid transmission rates ‘put too many people in funeral homes’PM shuts schools in third national lockdown expected until mid-FebruaryTaylor Swt and Harry Styles in hunt for top spot in albums chartAmazon supremo Jeff Bezos tops list of largest charitable gts of Mel B discusses Spice Girls reunion following Masked Singer exit,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNursery and special schools reopened in Northern Ireland on Monday. Mark BainTwitterEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA leading teaching union has demanded an answer as to why nursery schools and special schools in Northern Ireland are not being afforded the same safety approach in line with rest of the education sector.Special and nursery schools ed as normal on Monday morning, while primary school children moved immediately to remote learning and those in secondary schools are now continuing their education under revised safety measures as the number of Covid cases in Northern Ireland continues to rise daily.Chair of the Northern Committee of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation, Caroline McCarthy, said the lack of forward planning has left teachers feeling unprotected.“The chaotic approach of the minister to the management of the pandemic at a system level could be easily averted by real steps to improve safety such as informed and timely communication with the workforce he is depending on,” she said.“Special school and nursery school teaching and non-teaching staff have been ordered back into a school environment that the Minister himself has stated needed additional safety mitigations.”She said the Minister had failed to support their needs.“The only additional mitigation he has mentioned, compulsory face coverings in post primary schools, does not apply to either of these settings. The Minister has failed to show them any level of additional support,” she said.“All staff in school are entitled to the protections necessary to keep them and the children in their classroom safe. The obligation to provide these protections rests with Minister Weir, Boards of Governors, Employing Bodies and school managements. INTO remains ready as always to assist these iniduals and bodies in this work.”“We demand to know why the special and nursery sectors are not afforded the same consideration of their safety as applied to other school sectors. INTO calls on the Minister to demonstrate immediately protection for the staff in these settings.“Mr Weir and his Executive colleagues would do well to concentrate their efforts in support of their expressed wishes to keep schools open by having vaccinations made available to members of school staffs who wish to take it.”The organisation is now demanding that the very real concerns of teachers“INTO repeats its call to the Minister, the Department of Education, Department of Health and the Executive to take seriously the valid concerns of its members,” said Caroline.“We will only be reassured that safety is the Department’s primary concern when we see evidence of forward planning and an end to last minute and contradictory decision making.”Belfast Most ReadSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to discuss further restrictions as  deaths and , cases reported Heartache as bride Jade Parker bride dies just two days after her weddingHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardLatest CoronavirusEmpty pubs and restaurants offered to help with NI vaccine rolloutMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed cases of Covid- in your council areaDUP and Sinn Fein on collision course as O#Neill adamant weekend transfer tests should be droppedCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to discuss further restrictions as  deaths and , cases reported Latest from Belfast Arsenal defender William Saliba joins Nice on loan for rest of seasonBoris Johnson’s lockdown announcement in fullTimeline: The row over school closures in EnglandA timeline of UK lockdown measures since the pandemic beganTwo treated in hospital after Belfast crash between scrambler and car,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

After the most dficult of  months, Jon Tonge rates our ministers.Arlene Foster: First MinisterThis was the First Minister#s best year in a while, although that may damn with faint praise.Mrs Foster got her job back, devolution was restored, she sailed through the RHI inquiry report and earned praise even beyond her community for Covid consistency.Then her party bizarrely forced a cross-community vote against lockdown before agreeing to tougher restrictions within a fortnight. That at least united lockdown zealots and sceptics in anger and bafflement.Brexit yielded an Irish Sea border, and many blamed the DUP as midwives of their misfortune.Arlene nonetheless celebrated five years as DUP leader, most spent not dealing with Sammy Wilson or Edwin Poots.She was also confronted by the biggest rebellion in DUP history as  MLAs refused to support their leader on the Executive Functions Bill.Yet all the endless talk of leadership challenges remains just that - chatter. Foster remains the undisputed leader of unionism as her beloved country enters its centenary. Michelle O#Neill: Deputy First MinisterPaid a price for attending what seems the longest funeral in history, given the arguments it still attracts.Having survived a curious party leadership challenge from John O#Dowd in , the Deputy First Minister began the year promisingly. Sinn Fein#s quiet compromise on a standalone Irish Language Act helped facilitate New Decade, New Approach and theof Stormont.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichelle O#NeillPA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMichelle O#Neill Via existing legislation, Irish language provision was to be extended and a dedicated commissioner appointedO#Neill#s party got most of what it wanted, on terms nonetheless acceptable to the DUP. O#Neill#s pronouncements on the need for an all-island strategy to deal with Covid made good sense. But at the end of June came that funeral furore. This extended even beyond those whose views on republican commitments to public safety were shaped by an earlier era.We did not really miss the joint briefings from the First and Deputy First Minister. Loveless marriages on public show are not a great watch. But their absence symbolised the void in joined-up government. And no one was surprised when Michelle found  reasons why she was unable to attend Arlene#s big centenary party next year.For the Deputy First Minister, the hope is to seize the main office in . Sinn Fein#s strong performances in the South increase expectations, and pressure, on its northern leader. Robin Swann: HealthThe lockdown king had a strong year, commanding respect across the political spectrum. LucidTalk surveys showed most of the public backed tough Covid restrictions. Swann immunised Northern Ireland from the wildlyoptimisticus virus strain offered by the Prime Minister.The Health Minister must have had moments of regret at choosing the one job more taxing than his former role leading the UUP. Still, such experience helped with the crisis management.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRobin SwannMichael Cooper FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueRobin Swann Northern Ireland#s NHS crisis long pre-dated Covid, shocking testimony to the three-year absence of devolved government. Swann helped prevent total collapse and quickly settled the health workers# strike.Critics suggested Swann was optimism#s antidote. They criticised his early warning that , might die as alarmist, % beyond the actual toll. There remained concern over whether the Covid focus was at the expense of other treatments. Businesses raged against stop-start lockdowns. Van Morrison declined the invitation to the Swann Christmas household bubble. Ironically, Swann ended the year being criticised for being too soft in not imposing a travel ban from Britain.But overall, no one could accuse Swann of swerving science or ducking extraordinarily dficult challenges. Edwin Poots: AgricultureAppeared at times a masked version of Sammy Wilson in terms of lockdown scepticism and leadership challenges.In an extraordinary scientic breakthrough in October, Poots seemed to discover a mutant strain of the virus in which transmission in nationalist areas exceeded that in unionist communities by six to one.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseEdwin Poots FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueEdwin Poots When sticking to his agriculture brief, Poots is well regarded as a capable and often conciliatory minister who listens and engages. The DUP old-school veteran is on top of the issues and commands the respect of the farmers and the community he serves.Whatever Poots# aversion to some aspects of lockdown, there were no rule breaches amid the grief of the funeral of his father earlier this year.Ended a dficult year testing positive for Covid-. Peter Weir: EducationSometimes seemed so keen on keeping children in school at all costs you half-expected them to be in class on Christmas Day morning. But it#s a strange world when an Education Minister - or Under-fire Education Minister, to give Peter Weir his full title for most of the year - gets criticised for wanting children to go to school.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePeter Weir FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":truePeter Weir Arguments over transfer test locations at least deflectedfrom the age-old battle about the tests themselves. Public opinion is evenly ided. Those whose kids are most likely to pass are most in favour of the tests, funnily enough. Such arguments will persist long beyond the DUP minister#s tenure.An Arlene loyalist, Weir deserves credit for wanting to keep education as normal as possible. He recognised that remote learning experiences y wildly and disadvantage most those in greatest need. Nonetheless, January classes in school look unlikely. Expect his decision to persist, with some GCSE and A-level examinations next summer to come under further pressure. Another climbdown seems likely. Nichola Mallon: InfrastructureThis ought to be one of the more attractive Executive posts, allowing strategic development. Yet the Covid grimness was so all-consuming that Mallon#s job became simply keeping the show on the road - literally in terms of transport services.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseNichola Mallon FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNichola Mallon The SDLP#s solitary Executive presence, Mallon did good work in terms of liaising with those services andkeeping airports alive, but some taxi outfits remain close to collapse, even with rescue packages. Greener bus orders and Casement Park renewal were rare decisions beyond the crisis management. Naomi Long: JusticeNormally one of the adults in the room. Helped broker dficult Executive compromises on lockdown.

This is about learning, not getting everything right first time, she said. It should be enjoyable for parents and their children. This is not something you need to do all day.Here are her tips for getting the most from remote learning:. Set a routine daily and stick to it. Try to keep it as close to the school routine as possible. Get the children up and dressed, breakfast as usual. Know what time lessons will begin and end. Remember that there are lots of children in a class so with one-to-one teaching they do not need to be working for seven hours a day.. Children thrive on routine and many in primary school follow a visual timetable. Create your own school timetable. In many primary schools pupils complete numeracy and literacy in the mornings and other subjects such as PE in the afternoon. Work out what is best for them.. Create a designated home learning space for your child away from all distractions. Turn off the TV and choose a space preferably at the kitchen table or,that has too many disruptions with other family members interrupting, a dining room table or a desk - not their bed! Set up this space with everything they need to learn and study.. Take breaks between lessons. Parents are the first educators of their own children. Engage in all the activities that your children love. Incorporate some material from school into their lessons but enjoy the time together painting, crafting, reading or even baking.. Reach out to the teacher. Follow the digital remote learning plan that will be sent to you. Keep communication channels free with your child#s class teacher. If you are unsure of something use the school#s chosen online s to communicate. Check the school#s website regularly for information.. Use online resources and make their use purposeful. Most schools have links to online learning on their school website. Make sure that you have the passwords for any apps the school has bought and your child can access their My School Ck learning. Use the iPad to visit educational apps and videos. YouTube has many tutorials of lessonsyou are unsure of something.. Prioritise your child children#s mental health. Be happy and try to stay motivated. Have so me designated time for mindfulness activities. Take the children outdoors as much as possible for active sessions outside or exploring nature.. Structure free time. Make time during the day to practise their musical instrument, play football or to watch TV.. If your child is reluctant to complete set tasks from their class teacher, explain to the teacher the dficulties you are having and devise a form of positive reinforcement together. The teacher may have a reward system that could be used for all the children in the class.. Keep a diary. You will not get this time back again and it is a living history lesson. Enjoy your time together and remember, this is one-to-one learning - your child will be used to being in a classroom of maybe - children.Belfast Most ReadSammy Wilson defends Portrush visit after day trippers head to the coast despite lockdownBelfast woman Lucy McIlhatton killed in Springfield Road crashCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive to discuss further restrictions as  deaths and , cases reported Heartache as bride Jade Parker bride dies just two days after her weddingHow Co Down couple breathed new le into historic #Frankenstein house# Castle WardLatest Northern IrelandTwo treated in hospital after Belfast crash between scrambler and carStormont Executive has ‘very dficult decisions to take’ over virus – FosterShuttered small retailers ‘losing out to giant rivals’Doctor says profession taken for granted in vaccines rowStormont Executive to meet over coronavirus responseLatest from Belfast Two treated in hospital after Belfast crash between scrambler and carKey points from Boris Johnson’s lockdown announcementCurrent Covid transmission rates ‘put too many people in funeral homes’PM shuts schools in third national lockdown expected until mid-FebruaryTaylor Swt and Harry Styles in hunt for top spot in albums chart,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Barman Andy Nutt is preparing to pour the last measure at the well-known local pub.Reporter: Liam Tunney::  Dec   addthis, Knobbsrsquo Tavern closed in March, just before the pandemic arrived. In the week leading up to its final hurrah, we caught up with barman Andy Nutt and a few regulars.A well-known County Derry pub that has been in operation since  will close its door for the final time on Thursday.Knobbs’ Tavern in Kildoag, between Claudy and Donemana, was originally a grocery store that serviced the local area, but the community it sustained has been shrinking.On Saturday, they held a packed farewell concert, and when the County Derry Post caught up with a few of the regulars on the Friday afternoon, they were in reflective mood.“We’ll miss the yarns and the company,” said previous owner, Jack Knobbs, who was perched at the corner of the bar with his dog, Honey.“It was originally what they call a licensed shop and the first time it was opened as a bar was in . Until , the shop was still here and the bar could only hold maybe seven or eight people.“It would have been mostly locals in the bar and then in  they built on the upstairs and it would have hosted a lot of music – mostly country and western music.” googletag.cmd.push Jack is quietly spoken but points me in the direction of black and white photographs on the wall, where he featured in the Kildoag Wanderers FC side and the local cricket team in a previous era.Both teams used the bar as their base, and the social aspect the rural pub brought to the area is something Jack feels will be greatly missed.“The place would have been packed out on a Saturday night – people would have come from Donemana, Waterside and Claudy for the music.“We just enjoyed the craic. You had the odd tall story told. It’s hard to beat a good story, evenit’s not true!”Mervyn McComb lays claim to being the bar’s oldest customer. “I’ve been coming here about  years,” boasts the -year-old. googletag.cmd.push  “I was in it when the old bar was in the other room. Then, when they opened up the lounge, the place was packed to the rafters. “A lot of old bars seem to be closing up, there’s not the customers there used to be. It’s going to be badly missed. “It’s local people that come here.”Right on cue, a loud cheer erupts from the men as another regular walks into the bar, while Ian informs me the bar has its own taxi driver in residence.Barman Andy Nutt prepares to explain further. He mutes the small television mounted above the bar. This is serious stuff now.“There were six women arrived from Cumbria in England on a Tuesday night. They were on a biking tour and on their way to Park.“They came in and asked to use the toilet and I said that was no bother at all. One of them askedthis was a bar and I said it’s been called many things, but you could definitely call it a bar.“She askedthere was any chance they could have a drink and to cut a long story short, they ended up leaving the bikes here!“They stayed all night so I said I would get them a taxi man to get them back to Park. I rung up Eddie Curry and askedhe could do a run.“Eddie said ‘I’m definitely not going to Park’. Then I told him it was six women and he asked what time I wanted him down!     “I got a text from them that evening then – I think they were in Portrush.“It said: Andy, no Guinness at pound., no gin and tonic at pound. – we shouldn’t have left you!”The tale is typical of the kind of comical, slightly embellished yarns that used to be commonplace in bars across the country, but rural decline is threatening to silence them.Mervyn McComb’s son, Ian, believes that people make the bar what it is.“It’s a good wee bar, with great people in it,” he says. “There were memorable nights here every weekend. It was always good craic.“There used to be bands in upstairs and the place would have been jammed. It always did a good trade, was well run and there was never any trouble. “I’m  now so I’ve been coming here maybe  years. It will be sorely missed and it’ll hurt the community.”The range of presentation cheques that adorn the bar’s walls give an indication of how the community will suffer without its hub. Each year, the bar ran a charity drive and the evidence of their impact is clear in the many comments left on social media following news of Knobbs’ closure. Nicola Doherty fondly recalled a vintage tractor rally held at Knobbs’ after her father had beaten cancer.She commented: “We held our first tractor run in there when my dad beat cancer and bought a vintage tractor. “We hoped for a few tractors to show up and to raise a couple of hundred, but the place was packed, and we raised pound, for the Sperrin Room. “Great memories, I’m sad to see it close the doors.”The doors will indeed close, but Saturday night’s punters were treated to the nostalgic sight of the rafters reverberating to the sound of the Father and Son Remo band in the lounge above. There is a black cat that Jack Knobbs says follows him to and from his house to the bar on every visit.It sits almost sentry-like on the windowsill outside Knobbs.On a bright summer’s afternoon, Jack’s feline companion would be treated to a breathtaking view of the Faughan valley, but on Knobbs’ farewell night, Storm Jorge’s wind and rain battered its weary walls.The storm will have calmed by Thursday, as Andy Nutt prepares to close the doors. There is no doubt that Jack Knobbs will be there to oversee what will be an emotional moment.Knobbs concedes to the march of time.“I’m just a customer now,” says the former owner.“Sometimes I sit too long.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Until now. Liam Tunney talks to an ex-member of the infamous Gorilla Gang, who were responsible for many a headache at Slaughtneil discoThe Slaughtneil GAC committee used to meet every Monday evening. The meeting was supposed to be a general meeting about club business, but usually got bogged down with the disco. Discussions often revolved around two groups of boisterous young men in particular – the Gorilla Gang from Draperstown and the Banana Gang of Bellaghy. The latter were set up in reaction to the former, whose name was notorious around south Derry throughout the s. “The name was actually originally meant to be ‘Guerrilla Gang’,” an ex-member told the County Derry Post. “About  or , things were getting hot and heavy and the likes of Ballinascreen was getting saturated by the British Army. googletag.cmd.push “There would have been fighting with the UDR or the Brits, andthey came into Draperstown, the Gorilla Gang would have gathered up a posse and put them out. “There were two or three gangs in Draperstown at that time. One of them was the Wombles and the other one was the Sixtown Clowns. “They all used to fight amongst each other at small discos that used to be on round Draperstown before Slaughtneil started. “The police knew about the Gorilla Gang. I had a few older brothers that went to Spain, and on their way home they were pulled in at London airport and quizzed about the gang!” googletag.cmd.push As the disco’s popularity began to grow, the three gangs soon set their grievances aside as the possibility of taking their local scuffles to a wider field presented itself. “The disco took in the whole of south Derry, so there was more boys to fight with outside your own town,” he recalled. “It was just like that at those times around dance halls. In the early s, before Slaughtneil, the older Gorilla Gang would all have been over in Dungiven fighting at the Castle. “There were a wile lot of boys in the Gorilla Gang that were mad for fighting, and then everyone started making up their own gangs to fight us.     “I think that’s where the Banana Gang came out of, that they were going to get the Gorilla Gang at Slaughtneil. “I think the Banana Gang gave the Wombles and the Sixtown Clowns a bad beating one night and then they didn’t want to go anymore. “Well, they were mad to go, but they couldn’t because they were scared of the Banana Gang. They came to the Gorilla Gang and askedthey could join up.” The merger prompted a rivalry that lasted throughout the late s and caused the Slaughtneil bouncers no end of trouble. Our ex-member feels that the gangs’ propensity for bravado and fisticuffs helped boost the crowds that flocked to the hall on a Friday night. “Four carloads of us would leave the town to go down to Slaughtneil. We didn’t chance taking the bus, becauseyou were fighting, the bus driver wouldn’t let you on,” he said. “I remember going down to Slaughtneil and being told these Banana Gang boys were gonna be there, and two nights in a row, we went down, and they weren’t there. “The third night we went down, we thought they weren’t turning up, so maybe only five or ten of us went and we got some beating from the Banana Gang that night – they all turned up! “God help them bouncers. I don’t think Slaughtneil would have been Slaughtneil without it. Everybody was going, girls and all, to see what was going to happen next week. “If there was a small scuffle in the car park, threats were made about who was going to be there next week that wasn’t there tonight.  The characters’ nicknames roll off the ex-member’s tongue. Bungle. Flan. Rocky. Numan. Turk. Goggles. Nelly. Bruce. Shiny, who ‘couldn’t beat eggs’ but drove the getaway car. The King, who would run out onto the pitch and shout, ‘I’m the King of the Gorillas and I eat bananas for breakfast’ before a dust-up. Johnny the Donkey, who played the role of negotiator when the gangs were thrown out of the car park and arranged to meet halfway between Draperstown and Bellaghy to finish it off. An eclectic mix, but one name resonated more than others. “Flathead was the feared name. He was a real tight boy, he would have fought anybody man to man,” he said. “We would have said, ‘you boys will be in trouble next week, we’re taking big Flathead with us’, and everybody would have been at Slaughtneil the next week for the big punch up outside! “Even the bouncers were a wee bit scared of big Flathead because he was big for his age. There were some characters about.” While the rivalry between the two gangs was intense, it never created any lasting grudges and the member recalled how, by chance, he encountered one of his nemeses years later. “I hadn’t seen this boy for years, until I was going along one day in the car through Rocktown and heading for Bellaghy,” he said. “I saw a man walking along the road in the pouring rain and I stopped to seehe wanted a lt. “He hopped in anyway and was talking away to me and when he was getting out of the car, whatever way he turned sideways I recognised him. He caught on then to who I was too. “We were good friends at school, but then he was in the Banana Gang and I didn’t really want to let him know that I wanted to kill him, and he didn’t want to let me know either!” Time and people move on. The exploits of the Gorilla Gang may seem shocking when viewed through a st century lens, but our ex-member says it was a dferent era. “When I look back, I never knew of a man being hurt badly. When I hear the gang mentioned, it makes me laugh,” he said. “There were no mobile phones, no fancy cars. Anybody that had a car, it had cost them maybe pound. That whole thing is just lost. “I know it wasn’t good going to all them dance halls and fighting, but at the same time, no one was doing drugs or anything, it was just a punch-up. “Just a locka lads with a few beers in them, that fell out with another group of lads and there were a load of myths and legends that never even happened. “There were a few nights when I was younger that I maybe woke up in the morning with a black eye and a cut forehead and I said to myself, ‘oh my God, what am I at ’, but apart from that, I’ve no regrets. “We were all young cubs. Apart from the odd bleeding mouth and a bust lip, there wasn’t much harm done.” “God help them bouncers, those men got some torturing! Them boys did some organising to keep that all going. “For a club on top of a mountain, they did well to actually get people to get up there. There’s not even a pub.” It’s unlikely south Derry will ever see the likes of the Gorilla Gang again, but their mention invokes howls of recognition and intrigue. With a chuckle no doubt brought on by the memory of discos past, the ex-member had one idea that might have some under lockdown pining for its end. “I couldn’t say that I’ve any enemies out of it, put it like that. If we could get a Banana Gang-Gorilla Gang reunion night gathered up, I’d say we could have a good laugh!” See also: If you build it, they will come: Slaughtneils field of dreamers Spinning the soundtrack to a timeless era South Derrys ballroom of romance The goose that laid the golden egg Bringing Muhammad to the south Derry mountains The night a TV star came to Slaughtneil  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Joe Cassidy and captain Ciaran McNally took Michael McMullan on an wander into the past... Twelve years before helping Cathal Scullion to strike gold in an Ulster Club final, Joe Cassidy was setting up goals. This time, in the colours of Ballynease PS. A week after losing the  Castle Cup final, by virtue of a last minute goal, to a Johnny McBride and Bosco ONeill inspired Moneymore, the sides met again. googletag.cmd.push The shoe was on the other foot this time. Only a goal would save Bellaghy, thought Cassidy as he stood over the late free. With the benefit of hindsight, only Ronaldo would have found the net from the environs of right wing. Ciaran McNally began his run from full-back. He took a complete gamble. “I just swung at er with an auld scuffed box, and she fell into the net,” laughs McNally, who was the teams goalkeeper  months earlier.  Joe Cassidy and Ciaran McNally celebrate success with Ballynease PS This was the start of McNally and Cassidys winning run. They were on Bellaghys Ulster minor winning team six years later. Under McBrides captaincy, the Bellaghy duo played for Derry in the  All-Ireland minor final defeat to Westmeath. googletag.cmd.push By that time, Cassidy had secured the first of six senior medals as a list for the  win, which ended Bellaghys eight year absence from the pinnacle of Derry football. McNally had to wait until his debut year of  for senior glory and he would pick up four more championships and captain them to Ulster glory. “The best team, more often than not, always wins the championship,” Cassidy begins. “We had two dferent Ulster minor winning teams– two complete new sets of players.” Sam Maguire winners Karl Diamond, Danny Quinn and Joes older brother Damian were also to the fore.     “There was the likes of Gerry McPeake, Seamus Birt, Damian Brown and Benny Lee, boys that had a bit of experience.” The pieces of the puzzle were slotting into place to rule the Derry club scene. ---- Kilmacud Crokes goalkeeper Mick Penders late penalty save, from Damian Cassidy, denied the Tones a second All-Ireland on St Patricks Day , but after going on to dominate the race for the John McLaughlin Cup, Crossmaglen became their nemesis in Ulster. “They beat us in and . Both times, there wasnt the kick of a ball between the two teams,” McNally outlines. The  All-Ireland final, between Dublin and Galway, was the video of choice on the Bellaghy bus as they headed to their  Ulster semi-final date with Enniskillen. The irony wasnt lost on Joe Cassidy. Dublin had three men sent off, including then Derry senior boss Brian Mullins. Later that afternoon, Bellaghy also finished with  men as they bowed out of Ulster. “In those first four of five years, we got to Ulster finals and semi-finals regularly,” McNally adds. Without an Ulster title, Bellaghy were going to underachieve, he remembers thinking at the time. Joe Cassidys thoughts also flash back to the  final and having it won until John McEntees late equaliser. In the replay, Bellaghy were also a point up going into injury time. Cassidy remembers Damians free dropping in around the Crossmaglen square. If they even had kicked the ball dead the title was theirs, he laments. “The ball got played out to the wing to Oisin McConville and he ran about  yards,” Joe adds. “With hindsight, the best thing wouldve been to do a Sean Cavanagh and pull him down....wed have been Ulster champions.” Three passes later, Cathal Short – who played on the same UUJ Freshers team as Cassidy and Gareth Doherty months earlier– slid the ball past Kevin ONeill and Cross were on their way to their first All-Ireland. Lavey knocked Bellaghy out of the  championship, before Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee took charge at the start of a three year stint that brought three league and championship doubles. For, Joe Cassidy,  was their best chance of winning an All-Ireland. By , Paul Diamond – who Cassidy rates as one of the best he played with – was out of favour. Gone was the experience of Danny Quinn and Damian Cassidy. “For us, hewas a leader. He was one of those boys I loved playing with, he could hit you with a pass from about  yards away and not all midfielders had the ability to do that. Damian was the same. You just needed to make a half a step and Damian had the ball popped in your hand.” After a comfortable win over Lavey in the  county final, Bellaghy were back knocking on Crossmaglens door in the Ulster final, but super-sub Michael Moley scored the winner. Ballinderry qualied for the final the following year, after beating Lavey out the gate at Bellaghy. Joe Cassidy, who was stewarding at the game, remembers Conleith Gilligans fist pump towards a vocerous Shamrocks support after being replaced late in the game – as a bring on Bellaghy type salute. “That county final was one of my favourite ones. It was at Ballinascreen and it was on a Sunday night. There was an unreal atmosphere and a young group ofboys brought flares. “I remember walking behind the band...McNally and dferent boys were giving Gilligan a few welcome messages, so they were. Louis McPeake scored Bellaghys goal but they needed points from man of the match Damian Cassidy and Gavin Diamond to seal victory. That season ended with that defeat by Enniskillen. Without the elusive Ulster title, Bellaghys dinner dance in Arbys the following February was like a ghost town, Cassidy remembers. “Even though we had won the league and championship double...because you had done so bad in Ulster, it nearly looked like a bad year. There was a real dead atmosphere. “Youre expectations were to win an Ulster and, after seeing what Crossmaglen had done, the ultimate was to win an All-Ireland.” Despite a winning start to the  season, Bellaghy werent firing on all cylinders. Danny Quinn was player coach and was taking  percent of the training.  Ulster Club Champions  “Mammawas manager. You would land at training and everything was organsied, so he had those traits,” stated Cassidy. “Before that era , training was pretty pre-historic. My first innovator with training was Henry Downey at school. In around the club scene, Dannybegan to innovate things, he was coming off the back of county level. Mickey Moran came on board as Bellaghys trainer later in the summer, following Sligos exit out west. “That sortve gave us the kick up the backside that we needed, with someone of Mickeys level coming in. His training was top drawer.” One of Ciaran McNallys recollections of their Ulster winning campaign was how damn lucky they were to even get to Clones. The wheels almost coming off the wagon against Lavey in Greenlough. “It was a one or two point game, with a few minutes to go,” McNally remembers, when a loose ball pinged around in the Bellaghy penalty area. “I think it even hit the post and was heading across the line. All anybody had to do was get a toe to it and we were gone, then we ended up winning Ulster.”Joe Cassidy goes past Martin Calf in the  Ulster Club final. A six point win over Loup didnt satisfy the Bellaghy fans who now had lofty expectations. “People around the town were taking it for granted that wed beat the Loup and we, as players, could feel that, McNally continues, knowing it was going to be a battle. “I remember getting slated after it and people were saying youse were terrible and I remember saying....we won.” There was a draw with Slaughtneil in semi-final before Fergal Doherty, in his second senior season, hammered over a point in the early stages of the replay. “He would have been nervous in around the changing room, he was young at the time,” his captain outlines. “I remember the roar and relief from himand it was great from our respective.” The final was another showdown with their rivals Ballinderry again. It was a damp squib. Both McNally and Cassidy acknowledge almost falling over the line in a - to - victory. “Somebody needs to just stop that man,” McNally remembers thinking as the Shamrocks defensive rock Niall McCusker ferried the ball from corner back, up the wing before his diagonal ball went out for a . “The ball then came in, dropped short and we cleared it. Then came the relief with the final whistle.” ---- With three-in-a-row now secure, Bellaghy needed a win over Castledawson to keep their league hopes intact but an ankle ligament injury sustained in that game put Joe Cassidys Ulster club hopes in doubt. Bellaghy received a bye in the first round of Ulster, following Cargins suspension dished out after their final with arch-rivals St Pauls. Cassidy came on as a sub late in their semi-final victory over Cavan champions Gowna, who Bellaghy also met on their way to the  title. On the other side of the draw, Castleblayney disposed of Crossmaglen in the quarter-final before falling to Errigal Ciaran. “I had an idea ...you dont break up a winning team and we had played well in the semi-final,” Cassidy admits. Bellaghy won the toss and elected to play against the breeze. Bellaghy owned the ball in the first half but a litany of wides saw them trail - to - at the break. Peter Canavan had fired over the bar for the games first score, but never got a kick off David ONeill who dominated the Tyrone legend in the air. Cassidys worst nightmare was being paired off against Neilly in training games. “Between him and Sean Marty , I dont know how many roastings I got over the years.” Birt gave Cassidy the nod to warm up at the interval and six minutes into the second half, he entered the fray. “I was coming in fresh and the first ball I got, I turned and fired this thing over the bar from  yards. You looked like a super player but the breeze was carrying it.” Bellaghys defence, which included man of the match Peter Diamond, held Errigal scoreless for a full  minutes until Mark Hartes consolation goal in stoppage time. Six minutes before that, Cathal Scullions goal put the game to bed and Bellaghy could savour the march to glory. “Karl Diamond put the ball into the corner,” Cassidy recalls, with the help of watching the game again in his father Dan Joes Ballynease museum of GAA. “Gavin Diamond came off the shoulder, I flicked it to Gavin and it became a two versus one. He put it into Chubberwho put it into the back of the net.” Cassidy and McNally, interviewed separately, both speak with a laugh of Scullion swinging his jersey over his head in celebration. “I will never forget Peter Docon the terrace, jumping up and down. At that stage, you knew you had it. There is no better feeling when you have trained your whole le to try and win something,” Cassidy enthused. For McNally, it was always about learning from defeats and the steeliness it helps to generate. “I always tell people its not all badit makes you come back the following year that bit more determined.” It took Scullions goal to cement the result. Some years later, Ciaran lost his fatherand mothersuddenly but he clearly remembers his father telling of the sheer joy on the Clones steps, as Bellaghy eventually ended their Ulster losing streak. “The supporters were so disappointed in previous years. To have that picture in your head, of us being home and hosed, it was special.” At the final whistle, McNally embraced goalkeeper Ciaran Donnelly before being whisked off to the presentation area by an Ulster Council official. After years in the Ulster wilderness, the Tones skipper stood alone, before bellowing into the microphone to urge the throngs of joyous royal blue clad players and fans to join him. McNally didnt tempt fate. No speech was prepared, but two things came flooding back. He firstly made sure to commiserate with Errigal Ciaran. He knew the drill, having had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Seamus McFerran Cup before McEntee, Moley and Short – on three separate occasions - pulled it out of Bellaghys grasp. He also had a sincere word of thanks for Seamus Birt and Colm McElwee who took an awful lot of abuse following defeats to Cross and Enniskillen. “I hope you are as quick to come forward and thank them,” McNally told the Bellaghy faithful. “They done a lot of work, won us three-in-a-row and an Ulster.” Following the customary post game meal in Paudge Quinns restaurant, the team bus – rocking from the sing-song inside – rolled into the middle of Bellaghy. The players marched up to Muldoons shop and back to the Diamond, before heading to the club to celebrate long into the night. “Those are the nights you will never forget,” Cassidy insists. “There is no tomorrow, just endless partying, craic and everybody is in good form. There is something special about waking up the morning after a club final. There is no hangover, you just cant wait to get to speaking to people and meeting your family.”  Ciaran McNally rasies the Seamus McFerran aloft in the Clones tunnel. His younger brother Ryanlooks on. In the All-Ireland semi-final, they were defeated by eventual winners Crossmolina. It was an emotion Bellaghy knew only too well. Crossmaglen , Ballinderry and St Galls also beat the Tones on their way to lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. Patrick McAndrews goal gave the Mayo men a - to - interval lead. With eight minutes to go, two Gavin Diamond points had the margin down to two points before Ciaran McDonald was sprung from the bench. “He was carrying an ankle injury, but the next thing he came on and fired over a couple of absolute reevers and they beat us by four,” states Joe Cassidy, who one of Bellaghys only two scorers that day. Later that night, in the wee small hours, Ciaran McNally sat out on the swing in the family garden. Staring into oblivion, until the birds began to chirp. It was time to reflect. “I just couldnt go into the house,” he said. Despite people trying to soften the blow earlier in the night, McNally knew it was going to be a long way back. For Cassidy, he feels he speaks for everyone of that era - highlighting the regret of not winning an All-Ireland. “After that, managers came in and tried things and what youll find is...managers will generally get the blame, iniably from players – and I include myself in that,” Cassidy said. “It is only with experience and hindsight, you realise it had f**k all to do with management. It was to do with hunger and lots of us were making excuses.” Ballinderry beat them in , a final Bellaghy played better than their grind a year previous. First round defeats at the hands of the Shamocks and Glenullin prevented them from getting back to a decider until Slaughtneil beat them in the  final. Under the tutelage of Damian Cassidy, they realised that John McLaughlin wasnt a million miles away again. “One of his main attributes as a manager is his ability to get best that he can out of squads. Every night at training, he challenged you, states Joe, who was top scorer in the  championhship. Their - to - win over Loup in  took Bellaghy to  on the roll of honour. It was followed up by an Ulster win in Crossmaglen but that was the last hurrah in the winners enclosure. St Galls, with future Bellaghy boss John Rafferty at the helm beat them in an Ulster final. “Money couldnt buy what I got out of it,” McNally sums up of his career. “The only travesty about it is that you get too far down the line before you realise it. It was taken for granted.” “You see things now, with families all gathered aroundtaking photos...we didnt do that because we thought thats the way it was.” Its a regret. McNally got his hands on championship silver in four of the first five years of his senior career. “If I had a few lean years before it, you maybe wouldve knew to appreciate it,” he concludes. When Joe Cassidys lofted ball landed in the Moneymore goalmouth all those years ago and McNallys fisted goal brought silverware back to Ballynease, it was only the beginning of a journey to the steps of the Gerry Arthurs stand...a day when Bellaghy were kings of Ulster.

Lynn and Philip Hasson had arranged to get married in Donegals Redcastle Hotel in May, but the coronavirus outbreak halted their plans. The big day was rescheduled for November. However, as the date grew closer they were advised to move the celebrations to October in case lockdown restrictions got tighter again. When the ban on unnecessary cross-border travel came into force in early autumn, the couple were told they couldnt get married in the Republic. Undeterred, they rebooked their wedding at Derrys Beech Hill Country House in Ardmore at the end last month. googletag.cmd.push But on Wednesday, October , they got a call to say they would have to get married three days later, Saturday, October , before fresh lockdown measures came into play. After confirming that her son, Matthew, and his partner could make the wedding, Lynn gave it the go ahead. It was a bit crazy, I was working until .pm on the Thursday so we didnt have much time to pull it together, said Lynn, who is a support worker with Praxis Care. A host of Derry businesses pulled out all the stops to make sure the wedding could go ahead early and Lynn and Philip finally made it down the aisle. googletag.cmd.push We both have big families and lots of friends and we didnt want to leave anyone out so our initial wedding was for  people and ended up being for just  - including the bride and groom. In the end we only had close family and a few friends and they couldnt even bring their partners, but that was just the way it had to happen. There were a few people that couldnt come because they were isolating which was a pity.  Thankfully, Lynns two sons and Philips four children were able to attend. In the end it was very intimate and I stood back and looked and it was all the people that are closest to us which was lovely, said Lynn.     I was starting to think I was jinxed and in the run up to the wedding I was very nervous, but that day around lunch time all of a sudden I felt so, so relaxed. It was a brilliant day. And Lynn isnt resentful that she missed out on her big day As long as no one is sick then anything  is fixable, she said. I wouldnt want to be one of those families waiting on a phone call from the hospital. Lynn and Philp thanked everyone who made their last minute nuptials such a success. Wed like to say a special thank you to Aisling and Michael at the Redcastle who were excellent and gave us a full refund. To Jenny and James at the Beech Hill Country House for making everything run so smoothly and to Lisdale Signature Cars, Funky Cakes, Sass and Halo for the flowers, Natalie Doherty for the photography, Erin Gilroy for the make-up and Charlene Ferguson for the hair. And to my friend Anne Marie Boyle who did the balloons and decorations- she was my rock,” added the new bride.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Brendan McKeever was recently walking through Bay Road park in the city when he took a photo of a boat which has been stranded in the River Foyle since August.

With the Covid- vaccine continuing to be rolled out, there is hope that the pandemic will be brought under control as soon as possible in .

The vessel has become something of a local tourist attraction and has been compared to the Bad Eddie boat which washed up on a Donegal beach in  and has remained there since. The Donegal boat attracts a huge amount of visitors each year and has also featured in a video for a Clannad song.      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colette Rogers, Strategic Lead for Tobacco Control with the PHA, said: “During the COVID- pandemic, our health is more important than ever. Stopping smoking now will have a positive impact on your health, not only in the long-term, but also sooner in ways you probably hadn’t thought about. For example,you smoke, your fingers are in contact with your lips, increasing the possibility of transmission of COVID- from hand to mouth. “This has been a dficult year in lots of ways, but you can use the New Year as an opportunity to take a positive step to quit smoking and make use of our free support services to help. googletag.cmd.push “Due to the present COVID- situation we have put plans in place to ensure you can access PHA-funded Stop Smoking Services while still following social distancing guidelines,” said Colette. “This may include telephone contact or video calls as opposed to face-to-face support. These measures will ensure you can still access Stop Smoking Services in a manner which is safe and convenient for you.” Studies have shown that you are four times more likely to quit with help. Local Stop Smoking Services, nicotine replacement therapyand support from your family and friends can make all the dference when you are quitting, so make sure you are familiar with all the help available. googletag.cmd.push “We know quitting smoking isn’t easy and it can take several attempts for many people to quit for good, butyou are determined you can do it,” said Colette. “There is lots of help available to support you to quit. If you have tried to quit before and relapsed, accept it, work out why it happened, and focus on how you can avoid it happening again. If you found you have relapsed due to the dficulty and stress of the pandemic, remember the positives. You have quit before and you can do it again! “We would encourage people to take the time to look at our website at www.stopsmokingni.info.     As well as support and advice, you will find real le stories of people in Northern Ireland who have quit successfully. You can get insight from their experience and what has motivated them as you consider your smoke free choices this New Year.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael OKane took on the role at St Colmcilles Primary School in Claudy after Easter this year, with schools already closed by the first Covid- lockdown. He was nominated for the award by parent Fiona Garrett, who told presenter Stephen Nolan that Mr OKane had helped her children with two particularly tricky transitions. “My son Matthew was transitioning from P to big school and my daughter Oacuterlagh-Janetransitioning from nursery to P,” she said. “My daughter has a statement of special educational needs. During lockdown, she became very distressed at the sudden change of routine and Mr OKane really helped with this. googletag.cmd.push “He did this by doing videos to show her where her new classroom was going to be, what it would look like, who her new classroom assistant was going to be and how to sanitise your hands properly. “He also helped my son with the P leaving transition. My son started becoming distressed at not seeing his friends and the fact they wouldnt get a last opportunity to all be together. “Mr OKane arranged a wonderful Year  leaving mass, where he shot a beautul photo and video of the group together with his drone. “Matthews short, but positive experience of Mr OKane actually inspired him to want to become a teacher now.” googletag.cmd.push Miss Garrett said Mr OKane had gone beyond the call of duty to make sure parents were looked after too, and said he was a special person. “He is so good with children who have special educational needs. He goes above and beyond, going that extra little step just to make everything run smoothly. That takes a special person,” she said. “He goes out of his way to be so approachable and friendly. “Hes in the thick of it with the children, showing them how to use their talents and getting the best out of everyone, including his staff. “He really cares for his school family. Absolutely anything is possible with the right support and Im so grateful.”     Michael admitted it was a shock to receive a call from Stephen Nolan, initially askinganything was wrong, but he regained his composure to pay tribute to the schools staff. “I only started here at Easter and I inherited a fantastic school with fantastic staff and I dont think Ive done too much myself – everybody in the school has really pulled together,” he said. “Im just looking out the window here on a dreary Monday morning and thats the sort of thing we need to hear. Im in shock here, but Id just like to thank the staff, and in particular Fionas childrens teachers. “Theres a fantastic team in Year  who made children feel comfortable in coming back to school. “Its been tough, but everybody has gone above and beyond from teachers, classroom assistants, our building supervisors and cleaners. “Im going to relay this to all the staff because it will lt everybodys spirits,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Feacutein MLA Martina Anderson said she is to meet the Norths Minister for Sport this week to discuss the proposal. The talks with Minister Deirdre Hargey take place on Wednesday amid mounting support for soccer to be reorganised on an all-island basis. The Foyle MLA said: “The past year has been hugely damaging for all sports, given the loss of gate receipts and other revenues. “Having two soccer federations on an island this size never made commercial or sporting sense and there had already been signicant support, North and South, for existing proposals to create an all-island structure. googletag.cmd.push “However, in the wake of the Covid pandemic and the impact it has had on the game, more and more soccer clubs are assessing their long-term sustainability and finding that the appeal of an all-Ireland league is obvious. “Structured proposals are already in place and signicant progress has been made regarding potential sponsorship of an all-island league. “It is also abundantly clear from the success of other all-Ireland sports such as rugby, boxing, golf, GAA, hockey and cricket that we can achieve great things when we work on an all-island basis. “This should not be a politically sensitive issue but rather one of what makes best economic and sporting sense to soccer clubs throughout the island. googletag.cmd.push That is the basis on which we will pursue our discussions with the minister and as we continue to progress this issue in the time ahead.”      --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Students save a considerable amount of time by using the laneway to get to and from school.The former Down Council attempted to secure funds to upgrade the laneway and carry out a much-needed resurfacing and lighting scheme but liaising with representatives from a number of statutory agencies including the Housing Executive and Roads Service, the ownership issue could not be firmly established.Describing the laneway as a ldquovital link for residents who live at the Langley Road area in particular, Cllr Walker hopes that, with the publicrsquos help, he can find out who owns the land.ldquoThere are several street lights along part of the laneway but the Department for Infrastructure insists that it is not responsible for the land, he said.Cllr Walker says it is necessary to find out who owns the laneway as work is starting to upgrade Ballynahinchrsquos masterplan which includes a number of new walking trails in and around the town.ldquoWhy not include Beedhamrsquos Lane in the planned trails andwe could find out who this piece of ground it could pave the way for its upgrade, he continued.ldquoPeople could be forgiven for thinking that it leads to a farm. Given that we are in the midst of winter, the laneway is an awful state and children who are walking to school are literally getting covered in mud.Cllr Walker has suggested that it would not cost a signicant sum of money to upgrade the laneway which he suggests has the potential to become a key component of the townrsquos planned new walking trails.ldquoIf anyone can help me identy who is responsible for this piece of land could they contact either myself, the Langley Road Residentsrsquo Association or Newry, Mourne and Down Council, he said.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe upgrade of this particular laneway has been raised on numerous occasions in the past, but nothing has ever been done.ldquoGiven the high volume of pedestrian traffic which uses it, itrsquos important work gets underway to upgrade it.ldquoIn seeking to find out who owns the laneway I hope that it can be determined of this particular piece of ground is a registered right of way..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Caldwell.jpg","title":"Caldwell’s goal seals cup win  ","story":"DOWNrsquoS U- hurlers will have cause to celebrate Christmas with a little more cheer after they clinched the Peadar Oacute Laithaacutein Cup with a two-point win over Meath in Navan on Sunday.Two minutes into injury time, and with the sides deadlocked at - apiece, it looked aswe were heading to extra time when Ryan Byas struck over a wonderful m sideline.Meath looked to have sealed victory from a doggedly tough Down side with virtually the last play of the contest.However, straight from the resulting puck-out Michael Dorrian raced clear of midfield and floated the sliotar towards the edge of the box.Francis Caldwell reached highest and as he slipped past both Cottrell and Ennis in defence.A deftly-placed one handed flick out-foxed Jack Fagan as he lunged out to intercept the sliotar. He could only watch on but as it bypassed his attempts and nestled in the back of the Meath net.Finn Turpin opened the day with the first score of the game inside a minute. Downrsquos captain, Tom McGrattan, knocked over a free a minute later, but by the end of the first quarter Meath were in front as midfielder Joey Cole got the next three scores.McGrattan levelled matters from play shortly afterwards, as both defences were kept busy.On several occasions in the first half, Down threatened the Meath rearguard as goal chances went begging with James Clarke, Michael Dorrian and Caldwell all having attempts saved, blocked or bundled away from danger.Down struggled in the middle of the park and found it hard to win any puck-outs against a physically strong Meath team.They did though throw themselves into every tackle. Jarlath McCollum, Deaglan Mallon and James Higgins played out of their skins, harrying, hustling and shutting down any potential danger as Meath tried in vain to breach the Down defence.A McGrattan free and a Caldwell point saw Down edge into a two-point lead in a very scrappy final ten minutes of the half.With less than three minutes to the whistle, Meath hit a purple patch with four unanswered scores, two courtesy of the dangerous Ryan Byas and the others from corner men Rory Fagan and Josh Harris.Playing with a slight breeze in the first half, Meath knew thatthey were to ensure a victory on home soil, they would surely need some daylight between themselves and their northern opponents before the change of ends.Thankfully for Down, Turpin, Dorrian and Clarke kept Meath on their toes as they eventually managed to engineer the last score of the half.Oisiacuten Coulter popped the sliotar over from out near the side-line to leave just two points between the sides at the end of the half.Within the opening two minutes of the restart, Oisiacuten Coulter continued a good vain of form and had the sides level for the fth time, as both sides refused to yield.Joey Cole pointed four minutes later as the Royals introduced Matthew Cully to full forward, his introduction would breathe new le into their attack.Down initially struggled to handle the burly full forward, who ended the day with three superbly-taken points whilst under severe pressure from their Ulster counterparts.The lead changed hands again as two McGrattan frees and a Michael Dorrian point gave them a slight edge with the game fast approaching the second water break.A Jack Meagher score, followed swtly by Matthew Cullyrsquos first of the day, when he picked Downrsquos pocket after a quick puck-out had failed to reach its intended target, shook Down. Instead of leading going down the home straight, it was level at - each.With  minutes played Denis Darby won a sideline for the home side and when Byas hit the sweetest of strikes straight over Pearse Smythrsquos crossbar there were scenes of jubilation and euphoria from the Meath bench as surely it looked asJustin Coyne would be presented with the cup.Sean Young had this young Down side well drilled and it was a credit to the teamrsquos spirit that within the next  seconds Downrsquos goal machine, Francis Caldwell ensured that it would be a victory for Down in the strangest of seasons five days before Christmas.After seeing Tom McGrattan lt the cup, a delighted Young was magnanimous in victory and praised Meath for the high standard of Hurling that made this contest such a thriller.ldquoWe knew coming into the game today this would be a very dferent challenge than last week, he said.ldquoMeath are always a big strong physical side with a spread of talented Hurlers in their ranks. We knew it wasnrsquot going to be easy to play them in their back yard, it was going to be a monumental task to get over the line.ldquoI thought the game was nip and tuck in the first quarter as our main objective was not to concede any early goals playing against a stf breeze in the first half. I canrsquot praise the boys enough, our bench helped us over the line and it was a superbly taken goal from Francis.Meath: J Fagan, R Ennis, H Cottrell, E Cole, P Connelly, J Coyne, K OrsquoGorman, J Cole , E Grehan, R Byas , J Meagher , S Donnelly, R Fagan , J Harris, S Cunningham .Subs: M Cullyfor Harris, E McCormack for Donnelly, D Darby for Cunningham.Down: P Smyth, J Higgins, D Mallon, J McCollum, N Kelly, C Savage, F McFall, R OrsquoNeill, J Duggan, F Turpin , T McGrattan , M Dorrian , O Coulter , J Clarke, F Caldwell .Subs: S Milliganfor OrsquoNeill, F MacManus for McGrattan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan woman’s releases debut children’s book  ","story":"A CASTLEWELLAN woman has joined the ranks of childrenrsquos book authors.Kathleen McPolin, who is a Speech and Language Therapy Assistant in Downpatrick SureStart, has just published the first in an exciting new series featuring the farm-based adventures of Boomer and Blanky.Produced by Shanway Press in Belfast, the books are aimed at encouraging early yearsrsquo interest in reading and promote new vocabulary.Part of Kathleenrsquos work with SureStart over the past  years has been helping to facilitate rhythm, rhyme, and story sessions each week for children - with their parents or s.ldquoBecause this age group have short attention spans, I find the books that really capture their attention are the colourful ones with few words but yet have a story to tell, explained Kathleen.After finding it dficult to get the right books to cover everyday topics such as transport, weather, clothes, and food in a short-story style, Kathleen decided to create her own.ldquoChildren love to see the same characters appear regularly in their books.

On the side of a rural road, devoid of street lights, all but hidden by trees, was an old fashioned car, with smoke escaping from its engine.Standing beside the car, kicking it was a young woman in a bridal dress. She appeared to be beating up the motor. Jim applied the brakes of his vehicle and rolled down the window.lsquoCan I help rsquo The young woman looked at him with burning blue eyes, turned away and thumped the boot. lsquoUseless piece of junk,rsquo she shrieked. The young woman attempted to give the car one last kick, missed and ped with a thud on to her rear. Jim got out of his car. Trying not to laugh he rushed over to the young woman and attempted to help her to her feet.She pulled her arm away and with an effort dragged herself up using the carrsquos half open door.

The lady could not walk to her own wedding, besides it was growing dark. She grabbed his coat in near panic. lsquoMy ring,rsquo she cried. lsquoIrsquove lost my engagement ring!rsquo She dropped on to her knees. lsquoThis is a nightmare and you are not helping.rsquoJim walked at speed to his car and grabbed a torch as the bride crawled around the ground, feeling the earth in a vain attempt to retrieve the ring. Jim ed and shone the torch about the trees and grass. She grabbed his leg and pointed towards her car.lsquoItrsquos cursed, the car is cursed, and so are you.rsquo She bit him on the knee. lsquoGet off me,rsquo he shouted. She sat back on a muddy mound. lsquoI may have overreacted,rsquo she said. lsquoIs my lipstick smudged rsquo She wiped her hand across her lips. rsquoI think it might be smudged.rsquoJim did not answer, choosing to rub his knee, shine the torch, find the ring and hightail it to his unclersquos house as fast as possible. lsquoItrsquos all go,rsquo she said, trying to make conversation. lsquoIf my father could see me now, he would be so proud.rsquo The young woman adjusted her veil. It slowly drooped on to the side of her head and from there drted towards her lap. She picked it up and tossed it away.Jim located the ring beside the front wheel. lsquoIrsquove got it, Irsquove got the ring.rsquo He retrieved it and gave it a amateur polish. It was silver with an small amber stone as its centre piece. He read the inion lsquoTo M.K, Saul rsquo. It must have been handed down through her intendedrsquos family.lsquoYou great big sexy man.

Jim had spotted a somewhat sad looking gentleman on the road a few minutes before. lsquoShall we go rsquo asked the bride, as she gathered up her dress and walked towards his car, tripping over her loose shoe, all the while muttering under her breath.They didnrsquot speak much during the short trip to the church lsquoYes, I am looking for a ring.

The car came to a halt outside the little church. Warm lights beamed from inside. Jim thought it was an odd time of day to get married and a strange time of year. A few indistinct people stood around the grounds of the church.The bride opened the door, lsquoIrsquom here,rsquo she said and fell out of the car, lsquoIrsquom alright,rsquo she said painfully, stood up and slipped. Steadying herself, she kicked his car and her shoe dropped off. She picked it up and without so much as a thank you, disappeared, muddy and wet, into the church, resembling a worn-out scarecrow more than a bride. Jim waited a moment before driving off.Uncle Will and Jim talked and joked as they caught up with all the news over tea and cake. lsquoDid you ever meet Maureen Walsh rsquo asked Uncle Will. Jim shook his head as he helped himself to an extra slice of cake.Your grandfather was meant to give her lt to her wedding.

It was slightly bizarre, as one was a track and field meet, and the other a cross country race.As most of us donrsquot know what day it is, let alone which month, this blending of two dferent seasons seemed acceptable to many.The ANI Winter Track Series, spread over two nights, included a range of distances with East Down ACrsquos Neil Curran opting to give the km a blast. He has mostly been training solo since March and was glad of the opportunity to mix with some speedy competitors.He raced well and was pleased with third place in his heat. He recorded a time of .. which is only five seconds off his PB for the distance and proves that he remains in good form, despite the lack of racing to keep him sharp.In  his attempts at this distance exceeded the  minute barrier so this represents commendable progress overall. Keep at it Neil.The first cross country event of the  autumn season was also the last of the year. The Bobby Rea Memorial had been scheduled and rescheduled as restrictions rose and fell, but finally got away on Sunday at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.There was a limit on the entries and waves were allocated to permit social distancing. Sadly there were no spectators allowed. East Down AC had only three runners taking part as the change of date had affected overall attendance.The first to test the underfoot conditions were the senior men with Aaron McGrady representing East Down.The race got underway after a short period of silence in honour of John McKeag, the Ballydrain Harriers stalwart who sadly passed away the previous Monday in his th year.Aaron had hoped to fit in this particular race as a marker for his form ahead of the Intermediate Championships scheduled for mid-January but now likely to face abandonment due to the lockdown proposed to be implemented for six weeks after Christmas.The race consisted of two laps of .km each, the shorter distance designed, like the ision of the runners, into waves of up to a maximum of  runners each, to prevent mass overtaking to comply with social distancing requirements.As only half of the over  entries turned up, it was necessary to use only two waves.Aaron was drawn in the first wave alongside the faster runners and though he prefers to start relatively slowly and then set out to catch those in front, he doubtedit would be possible on this occasion so he was well to the fore from the off and came through at the end of the first lap in fourth place.However he stuck with his pre-race plan and when the runners re-appeared at the end of lap two, he was in third place behind Mark McKinstryand Craig McMeechan , and comfortably maintained his position until the finish line.He said afterwards that he was happy with how the race had gone and had no regrets about his tactics. The first three recorded times were ., . and . respectively, which is pretty hot running on a cross country course that was holding a fair amount of overnight rain. Well done Aaron.The second race was for senior and masters women and East Down AC again had only one representative mdash the ever-enthusiastic Sharon Madine.Sharon started conservatively in the second of the two waves, but proceeded to make steady progress and at the end of her two laps she had a time of . against her name. When the results of both waves were combined she placed overall th but first in the over- category. Well worth the efforts Sharon.The third and final event of the day was for Male Masters and again a sole East Down AC runner mdash the evergreen Dee Murray. Another who seems to have lost none of his competitive edge during the pandemic, Dee simply turns up and runs as hard as he can.On Sunday this meant that his time of . gave him th place overall and second in the over- category. Well done Dee.In spite of the absence of spectators, all who turned up said that it was well organised and they were glad to have taken part. As one of the few interested official observers, I have to agree with that.Sandwiched between these two events was the East Down AC annual Xmas predicted K at the Downshire Estate on Thursday evening.This is a fun event where runners try to guess how long they will take to cover the distance and then without a watch or other timing device do their best to match it. With the emphasis on accuracy and pacing rather than speed the way is wide open for all to snatch the prize.The top five were impressively close to their predicted times with fth place going to Johnny Holmes, who was seven seconds out. Deirdre Weatherall and Colin Shields tied for third equal - each with a five-second deficit.Seamus Savage was four seconds off his guess, which was good going, but it would have been hard to beat the winner Maureen Kelly who was a mere one second to the better of her guess. She was delighted to top the table and over the moon to find that her prize was a hamper of goodies as well as a pound voucher for Bells Supervalu Crossgar. Congratulations Maureen.Even though the runners had to be split into waves and social distancing was enforced, it was the best that was on offer due to current circumstances and it was a good boost to club morale. Instead of charging the normal entry fee, members were asked to donate food items which have been duly delivered to the Fountain Foodbank in the town.All in all it was a successful night for all concerned and an uplting end to a less than inspiring . Herersquos hoping that  brings better fortunes to all..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Conor.jpg","title":"Hazard the hero  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK goalkeeper Conor Hazard is targeting more silverware with Glasgow Celtic after his penalty shoot-out heroics helped the Hoops clinch the Scottish Cup on Sunday.The -year old saved two spot-kicks against Championship side Hearts as the nine-in-a-row Scottish champions clinched an historic quadruple treble. The enthralling cup tie ended - after  minutes with the sides locked at - after extra-time at Hampden Park.Hazard, who was recently handed the number one jersey by Hoops boss Neil Lennon, made both his European and Scottish Premiership debuts and retained the starting jersey for Sundayrsquos final.The stopper mdash who has also forced his way into the Northern Ireland international squad mdash was delighted to play a major part in his sidersquos cup final victory.And while his current contract expires in the summer which allows him to negotiate with other clubs in January, should he favour a move away from Celtic Park, leaving the club he has supported since he was a boy is the last thing on his mind.Conor described Sundayrsquos cup final as ldquocrazy day for him and his family who watched the match at home.ldquoThree weeks ago, I would never have been able to picture what happened there on that pitch, he said moments after his penalty shoot-out heroics.ldquoI am just absolutely over the moon. Irsquove been a Celtic fan my whole le and to get this opportunity, well I am just delighted, he said.ldquoTo play for such a worldwide club, we know what the fans expect and how much they drive us towards winning. It is an honour to play for them. I want to fully focus on each match, playing week in, week out here at Celtic, and hopefully it will come together.Conor said the final was a ldquomomentous day for him and his family, explaining that his lsquophone hasnrsquot stopped ringing.Conor grew up in Downpatrick and developed his skills in the Celtic academy, travelling across to Scotland for games from a young age.ldquoThe club means everything to me, he said. ldquoWe used to get up at am to get on the boat to go to matches and we wouldnrsquot be home until three the next morning. Itrsquos something I always dreamed of growing up.Conor has spent several spells out on loan in recent years in order to build-up his first team experience, readying him for a career between the sticks for Celtic.He got his chance to impress against Lille and Kilmarnock r as Celticrsquos form hit a rocky patch, but being selected by Lennon for the win over Hearts at Hampden Park was a huge confidence boost.ldquoI have to thank all of the staff and the manager for putting trust in me, said Conor.ldquoIt was a huge honour in such a big game. Thankfully, I was able to repay that trust with the two penalty saves. I have put a lot of work in and gone on loan spells waiting for my chance. The coaches have helped me a lot throughout the club.Sundayrsquos cup win clinched the domestic treble for Celtic for the fourth successive campaign, something that has never before been achieved. It is also the th time Celtic have been crowned Scottish Cup winners, with the Downpatrick man admitting the team has a lot of work to do to try and achieve its aims and targets this year.ldquoThe final was only my third game for the club, so Irsquom taking each day as it comes. As a team and as a group, this win could be a major factor in turning things round, he added.Conorrsquos family watched his cup final heroics at home in Downpatrick as fans were not allowed to attend the match due to coronavirus restrictions. However, they were over the moon with his achievements.ldquoI donrsquot think I have any fingernails left after that, laughed his beaming dad Gary. ldquoWe didnrsquot know up until the last minutehe would get the nod to play or not. We knew he did well in the European game and certainly made a case for himself. He only found out on Thursday from Lennon that he would be playing.Whilst there was undoubted pride from his dad, Gary said Conor has deserved his break due to how hard he has worked.ldquoHe has put so much time into Celtic over the years and done all the right things. All the close family are so proud of him, his mum Pauline, his younger brother Jack. He was superb.ldquoConor very much wants to be able to go on and make himself number one for Celtic. He is only  and this was just his third appearance, so hersquos been doing well. He had a loan spell at Dundee and did very well there and that has put him in good stead.Gary said Conor has also been drawing high praise from his Northern Ireland manager Ian Barraclough after breaking through for the senior team too.ldquoBarraclough has spoken really highly of Conor. He did very well for him when he was the manager at under-age level and the boss knows what he can do in training, he said.Conorrsquos family are no strangers to sporting success either.

The pupils I spoke to were confident and articulate users of the digital resources at their disposal. The school has developed effective support links during the pandemic to support distance learning.St Josephrsquos also received a special recognition badge last month for Cyber Resilience and Internet Safety, becoming the third primary school in Northern Ireland to be awarded this badge.The school had completed a pioneering education initiative developed to encourage online safety and cyber resilience amongst pupils in schools.The assessment report noted: lsquoSt Josephrsquos is a dynamic school which has a careful, considered and planned approach to developing and delivering a safe and secure digital technology learning environment for their pupils and have fully engaged their parental community in this development.rsquoPrincipal Laura Fitzsimons said: ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded these prestigious titles which highlight the schoolrsquos continual investment in resources and training.ldquoWe are very pleased and proud of our teachers, student digital leaders and all our pupils for their commitment to digital learning.ldquoIt was particularly pleasing to receive this positive news in light of the challenging times which we are currently living in..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd December 2020 Talking.jpg","title":"Talking about coercive control  ","story":"TODAY there are mothers and their children from the wider Downpatrick area living in refuges run by Womenrsquos Aid.There may be more over the Christmas and New Year period as the festive time can be a dangerous time for people living with their abuser.The prospect of a six-week lockdown means that demand for help is also set to increase as Womenrsquos Aid supported , women and children during the last lockdown.Eileen Murphy, chief executive officer of the charity, has in her -plus years of working provided support to women from the Downpatrick area.Based in Newry, she works closely with the South Eastern Domestic Violence Partnership run by the local Health Trust and in partnership with other agencies, including the PSNI.ldquoOur refuges run at % capacity but we also work with many women who never stay in our refuges, said Eileen.She is all too aware of the worry and fear that some women will be experiencing over the holiday period.ldquoMothers will be trying to make the best Christmas Day possible for their children, no matter the situation. They will be hoping that he [the abuser] will be OK, she explained.ldquoI have seen over the years that women and children develop this radar with antennas scanning all the time to judge his mood, howrsquos he walking, howrsquos he eating, scanning constantly all the time, thinking is it safe, is he OK, are we annoying him  It will not matter as he is only one who can control his behaviour.While Eileen is keen to highlight that Womenrsquos Aid will provide   help to women, she also wants to dispel some myths about domestic abuse and violence and to talk about coercive control mdash any act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.ldquoOne of the main things we do for women when they come into the service is to help her understand that there was not anything she did as therersquos nothing she could have done which would have stopped him, she said.ldquoWe have women who have had to beg to have a shower and we have women who phone us who are literally hiding in a hedge as hersquos walking up and down the street trying to find her.ldquoA lot of us think its black eyes and broken bones but the real damage is the psychological torture that is going on where women and children are terrorised in their own home. They are led to believe that everything is all their fault, they are at the root cause of whatever incident. When you are living with that  , you are only surviving.Womenrsquos Aid recently launched an awareness campaign called lsquoUnlock Your Lockdownrsquo to highlight their services to women who are living in fear or under threat.Eileen said: ldquoI would say that any woman who is worried at how she is going to get through Christmas andit is to do with her partner, then I would say to ring us and have a chat. We donrsquot force anybody into the service and we donrsquot make women leave home, thatrsquos always their choice.ldquoWhat we do is to work with her and help her to determine where she is and whatrsquos the best option for her. It can be either just one phone call to her engaging in full services for anything up to two years.She stressed that the first thing Womenrsquos Aid do when a women calls them is to assess the risk she and her children are in.ldquoThe first we do is assess the risk, to find out how safe she is, where she is, where her children are, what is the immediate priority  she stressed.ldquoDepending on the level of risk, we may had to do several dferent things. It could be that a woman is hiding out at a family member or friendrsquos house, so it might involve the police or social services.Then we try to manage the risk and reduce it as much as possible and then we try and work with out how best to help her move forward and to keep her safe. For the top % of women who come to us, we would hold a Multi-Agency Risk Assessmentconference and then we would work with them on a continuous basis.ldquoHowever, I would like to stress there is no such thing as low level risk of domestic abuse for women because the only person who is in control of whether that risk is high, low or medium is the perpetrator.She is dismissive of abusers where an incident of abuse involves either drink or drugs.ldquoIf you keep terrorising the people that you love and continually use the excuse of alcohol or drugs I donrsquot buy that, said Eileen.ldquoWhat drink and drugs to is give him an excuse for violence. When itrsquos over he will say it was the drink or whatever. But I always say to that isI woke up tomorrow morning to see my partner battered or bruised and he told me I had done it last night with drink in me, would I take a drink again  Yet these guys continue to do it.ldquoThere is no doubt about that we work with traumatised women and children and people try and deal with it in many dferent ways.

Mind you, he could have meant ‘lousy unionists’ in general, a description he applied to Churchill and Thatcher, as well as Johnson. Unionists have had decades of having to ‘make the best’ of lousy unionists in Westminster: indeed, almost every PM since Edward Heath, who prorogued Stormont in , has been accused of one form of betrayal or another.It isn’t just London-based unionists who are routinely accused of betrayal. Ian Paisley had regular outbursts about O’Neill, Chichester-Clark, West, Faulkner, Molyneaux , Trimble and Empey. Paisley was later unceremoniously dumped by the DUP when it thought his relationship with Martin McGuinnesswould see a flood of votes to Jim Allister’s newly formed TUV. Right now, in response to Johnson’s NI Protocol, the TUV, UUP, PUP and elements of loyalism are criticising the DUP for having got it so wrong with Johnson. Some in the DUP, unwilling to concede they were stupid to place all their eggs in a basket held by Johnson and the ERG, are now blaming the UUP for having supported the Good Friday Agreement in . Hmmm. That would be the same agreement the DUP claimed to have improved and then implemented with Sinn Fein since May , wouldn’t it    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We are not the puppets in this relationship. We won’t be letting May, Johnson or anyone  dictate the terms.”Yet Boris Johnson did betray the DUP. He promised them one thing and then did the opposite. He lied to the DUP’s inner core of leadership and negotiators. He came to a pre-election event in Northern Ireland last November and told the audience – mostly local Conservatives, bless them – to tear up and place in the bin any letters they might receive about any new border. In later interviews he continued to dismiss claims he was prepared to support any policy which might be construed as ‘undermining or weakening’ NI’s constitutional position. And therein lies the real problem for unionism. What Johnson did wasn’t unique. Like so many prime ministers before him – most of whom claimed to be supporters of the geographical constitutional integrity of the UK – he prioritised other interests over the interests of NI unionism. So, bearing in mind that he is merely the latest in a long line to follow the same course, what conclusion should unionists here reach  The immediate one, obviously, is that prime ministers and their parties don’t give a stuff about NI: because they have no emotional attachment to it.If that is the case, then it raises all sorts of other questions and problems. If you don’t have an emotional attachment to something then why hold onto itit is, as seems to be the view of many MPs down the years, more trouble than it is worth  Yet, why would successive UK governments, particularly during the years when the IRA was armed and active , seem so determined to find a way of placating SF rather than crushing armed republicanism  Why did successive UK governments invest more time and energy in building a working relationship with successive Irish governments  Why did successive UK governments – after the  referendum – conclude so many below-the-radar, nod-and-wink side deals and arrangements which would have required IRA Army Council approval   Why did the May Johnson governments – both propped up by the DUP – seem to think it of greater necessity to reassure the Irish government than the DUP or broader unionism Why is the DUP now reduced to the absurdity of pretending – and it really is a pretence – Johnson’s betrayal doesn’t actually amount to a hill of beans  Why does it continue with the pretence it can find ways to mitigate the impact of an arrangement which has the imprimatur of the EU, Johnson’s government and a whopping parliamentary majority  Why does it still trot out the line it can all be sorted by a vote in the Assembly in four years’ time I’m not overwhelmingly convinced successive UK governments have been actively determined to disengage from Northern Ireland. That said, nor am I convinced they would shed any tearsa majority voted to leave in a border poll. The task for unionism – and I’ve said this many times – is to read and fully understand the intentions and end purpose of UK policy since Stormont’s prorogation in . It seems to me there are two continuing priorities: a an absence of terrorist campaigns – a huge drain on resources and b an arm’srelationship in which NI remains in the UK but doesn’t require too much oversight or present too many problems. The task for unionism, in NI’s centenary year, is to bear that in mind and find a strategy and narrative which understands and accommodates the UK’s long term priorities for here.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...\"Some of the Spar branded products on the shelves of Sainsbury’s in Belfast todayIn an indication of the cost of the certicates, which must be filled in by a specialist such as a vet, the government has set up a scheme to compensate those having to fill in Export Health Certicates at a cost of up to £ a time, although it is unclear how long that government scheme will last.Supermarkets and some of their suppliers have been given a temporary ‘grace period’ exempting them from that part of the new bureaucracy until April .Today the News Letter saw multiple items which would require Export Health Certicates – including fresh pasta, sausages, ham, pork – on the shelves of a major Sainsbury’s store in Belfast.A member of staff said that about  product lines had been lost “because of Brexit” but that several hundred of them had been replacedwith local alternatives, some of which was the Spar produce.Sainsbury’s website shows  Spar own-brand items, including bacon, houmous, ready meals, deserts, chorizo and soured cream. However, some of those items do not yet even have a basic description, dietary information or ingredients on the website.Sainsbury’s confirmed that it had “a temporary supply agreement with Henderson Wholesale Ltd”, the Mallusk-based company which supplies  Spar and Vivo stores across Northern Ireland.In a brief statement, Sainsbury’s said: “A small number of our products are temporarily unavailable for our customers in Northern Ireland while border arrangements are confirmed.“We were prepared for this and so our customers will find a wide range of alternative products in our stores in the meantime and we are working hard to get back to our full, usual range soon.”An industry source said that talks between Hendersons and other major retailers had been going on since the middle of last year as a result of Brexit and the uncertainty which businesses have faced because decisions on the post-Brexit regime were left to the last minute.\u2028The Henderson Group said: “Over the last several months we have been contingency planning for Brexit to minimise any disruption to the food supply chain for our  stores across NI after st December .“We can confirm that we have entered into a temporary supply agreement with J. Sainsbury supermarkets that will see both parties working together to ensure availability for our customers.“Henderson Group is a major employer and retailer covering every part of NI. Over % of our fresh products are sourced and made locally.”Last Friday, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis tweeted: “There is no ‘Irish Sea Border’. As we have seen today, the important preparations the Govt and businesses have taken to prepare for the end of the Transition Period are keeping goods flowing freely around the country, including between GB and NI.”When asked on the Andrew Marr shows yesterdayshe accepted that there is now a border in the Irish Sea, Mrs Foster appeared to play down the signicance of something which she once denounced unequivocally. She said: “Well, it’s my job to mitigate against that and we’ve been doing that through a number of committees. There’s a regulatory issue there – of course, we always had SPS [animal product] checks, Andrew, you know that, when animals and animal products came across into Northern Ireland those were checked on a very minor basis and we need to make sure that that minor basis continues.”Mr Marr put to Mrs Foster just some of the multiple acronymns for the new red tape which has been introduced for GB companies wanting to sell to Northern Ireland. He put to her that “it looks very like a border”, to which the DUP leader replied: “Well, you know, I could stand here and bemoan the fact that we have left the European Union with a protocol I wish that that wasn’t the case, or I can now look for the opportunities as we move out of the EU...”On New Year’s Day last week, DUP Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots – whose officials constructed and are operating the new border under the eye of EU officials – tweeted to thank major pro-Brexit donor Arron Banks: “Thank you for all you done [sic] to make it happen.”:Irish Government did secret deal with Gerry Adams to free IRA prisoners days after  ceasefire, declassied file revealsIrish Government deliberately did not condemn ceasefire murders by IRA in  to keep Sinn Féin on board, declassied file revealsUlster Farmers’ Union lobbied for ‘unequivocal’ government statement on beef safety – months before BSE link to humans, declassied file showsCivil servants paid equivalent of £, a day for advice from ex-civil servant, declassied file revealsGerry Adams was ignorant of basic Protestant views and didn’t think he had to persuade unionists to back a united Ireland: Declassied fileGovernment pondered renaming or giving away Stormont as it meticulously planned for the Good Friday Agreement, declassied files reveal——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMike Kingston, who this week collected his long service medal to recognise the achievement, has shared his pride and some of his memories over the years.Mr Kingston, who is married and has two children and two grandchildren, joined Penarth RNLI on November  , as a volunteer crew member ndash and quickly progressed to become leboat helm.Along with his fellow volunteer crew members, he attended hundreds of incidents, launching day and night in all kinds of weather conditions, to go to the aid of people in trouble at sea.Since his retirement from being a sea-going member of the team, he has spent the last  years as shore crew and one of Penarthrsquos Deputy Launching Authorities, liaising with the coastguards when they request assistance, and managing the leboatrsquos launch.Mr Kingstonrsquos leboat career has extended beyond the UK. In , he was a member of a crew of just eight leboat volunteers from across the UK who flew out to aid the relief effort in flood-stricken Mozambique.Together, the team faced the dangers of crocodiles, hippos, poisonous snakes and anti-personnel mines, navigating rivers that had burst their banks, in a rescue mission to bring desperately needed medical relief to , people in villages marooned by flood waters.ldquoWe had five small D class inflatable leboats, and had to ferry doctors and medical supplies to areas that had been written off as impossible, as helicopters couldnrsquot land there and they were inaccessible by road, he said.ldquoIt was so hot that the soles of my boots melted. We had to spend the night on sandbars where we took turns to keep watch, as the crocodiles were very keen to join us.Since he joined the crew, Mike has combined his volunteering with his paid job in the South Wales Fire and Rescue service. He joined the service back in , at just , and progressed from his position as a firefighter, to the lead instructor for recruit training, finally finishing his career in  as Chair of the Water Rescue group, and a member of the servicersquos all Wales flood response team.Over the past four decades, -year-old Mr Kingston has seen huge changes in the way the RNLI operates.He has seen Penarth leboat station move from its original home in the deck chair store underneath the current Coffi Co building on the Esplanade, to its current location just up the road in a purpose built, modern leboat station.ldquoIrsquom sure the people of Penarth will remember the hand held maroons that were fired off by a leboat crew member to call the rest of us to the station for a launch, he said.ldquoBut even before that, I remember when the Pier Master would get us down to the station by firing the maroons out of a small cannon.ldquoNowadays, technology has moved on and we use pagers, mobiles phones and computer systems to respond to a shout.ldquoThese systems are a lot more sophisticated, but itrsquos still the same feeling when yoursquore called out of bed in the early hours of a freezing cold January morning.ldquoNo matter how times have moved on, one thing that remains constant is the unbelievable commitment of the whole RNLI team.ldquoThere have been so many highs and lows over the past  years. As all the team will know, itrsquos good to feel that yoursquore part of a team, giving something to your community.ldquoBut there have also been some sad times when people have lost their lives. Irsquom proud to have been a part of Penarth RNLI family.Thanking him for his  years of service, Jason Dunlop, Penarth Leboat Operations Manager said: ldquoOn behalf of all at Penarth leboat station, I would like to congratulate Mike on this fantastic achievement and thank him for his commitment and support to saving lives at sea over the last  years. We are all volunteers at Penarth RNLI, we give our time freely to support our local community.ldquoMikersquos contribution to the charity over the years has not only been volunteering his time, hersquos also been happy to share his wealth of experience with the crew as we train and work together when someone needs our help. Hersquos been a fantastic mentor to many and for that we thank him. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local community\"The increasing numbers of Covid- case numbers across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan Health Board area could not be any more serious or alarming.Therefore, this message needs to be acted upon urgently and be seen as a warning to each and every one of us about the seriousness of the health situation we are all now facing.If current projections continue, then by Christmas week we will be seeing more than four times the number of new infections each day, than we were seeing at the start of December. These projected figures are the highest we have ever seen in this County and are likely to reach almost , cases per , in the seven-day period up until Christmas Day.If you compare that with the figure of  cases per , when we entered the local lockdown, you can see how serious the current situation is. We can no longer be complacent.We know from the first and second waves that as case numbers increase, more people get seriously unwell, and we will inevitably see more deaths from Coronavirus - many of which can be avoided,we act now.We are deeply concerned that hospitals and primary care services across Cardf and the Vale of Glamorgan are now under unsustainable pressure due to COVID-, and sadly, but inevitably, the number of people who are becoming very sick is increasing daily.Each and every one of us has a responsibility to act now. We must all follow Welsh Government coronavirus regulations, butyou can also take further actions to protect those you love, then we urge you to do so.We should not meet with anyone outside our household bubble and keep contact with people outside our household to an absolute minimum until the current threat has passed, but especially in the run-up to Christmas.We know that staying away from loved ones will be painful for many, especially at this time of year, butwe do this now, we will be doing everything we can to protect our family and friends for the months to come.We know many people think that the vaccine is going to become more widely available, so everything is going to be okay. Regrettably, that is simply not the case. If we donrsquot change our behaviour now,many people will die before the vaccine is rolled out, people who donrsquot need to die, possibly people who you know.The full roll out of the vaccine will take many months, so now is not the time to be complacent. Very few of us are immune and the virus is still prevalent in our communities and our hospitals. By practising social distancing, washing our hands regularly and wearing face coverings we will all be doing our bit to help.So, our message is simple.Wash your hands regularly oryou canrsquot do that use sanitiser hand gel.Please try and stay at home and only go out for essential reasons andit is essential to go out, please do so in quieter periods.If you do go out, wear a mask when required and keep socially distanced by at least  metres, wherever possible.Please do not mix with other households or your friends.Work from home,you can do so.If you develop symptoms such as a new and continuous cough, a temperature, or a loss of taste or smell please self-isolate with your household and arrange a test.These small steps can really help us all to keep our communities safe.As a Health Board and Council, we are fully mobilised in the fight against COVID-. Doing so continues to be a huge challenge and is one that we will best achieve,we do it together, just as we did in the Spring.We are asking every one of you to achieve this challenge together.Letrsquos stop the spread, and letrsquos keep the Vale of Glamorgan, the NHS and our loved ones safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious.

People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi.

Across the Commonwealth, my family and I have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities, helping those in need.ldquoIn the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnicently to the challenges of the year, and I am so proud and moved by this quiet, indomitable spirit.

Not just from the virus but the isolation our response to it creates.So the Penarth Times will publish, online and in print, a list of support services - public organisations, charities, community groups and local volunteers - who are there to help in whatever way through this dficult time.And we are asking you to play your part by doing three things.First,you know an organisation or group that should be on our list, let us know and well add them so more people can benefit.If you know of a group doing good in your community, tell us so we can share their story and provide hope and inspiration.And, most importantly, think about who the people are in your community who you might be able to help, be it a card through the door or dropping off some shopping.
