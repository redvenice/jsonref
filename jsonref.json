[{"url":null,"title":"Venezuelas Guaid faces key test leadership vote","story":"Share this article Still, senior Maduro officials celebrated the bizarre gambit as a comeuppance for the 36-year-old lawmaker, who has been struggling to maintain unity in the unwieldy opposition coalition.Meanwhile, Parra, exercising his would-be authority, called a session for Tuesday, raising the possibility of rival claims to the legislature\u0027s leadership in the days ahead. A year ago, Guaidó asserted at a street demonstration that he was Venezuela\u0027s interim president in place of the \u0027usurper\u0027 Maduro, whose 2018 re-election has been rejected by the U.S., European Union and several Latin American governments.There was no indication of weakening support among the more than 50 governments that back recognize Guaidó as Venezuela\u0027s rightful leader. Brazil\u0027s government called the session an \u0027affront to democracy,\u0027 while the top-ranking U.S. diplomat in Latin America called Sunday\u0027s events in the chamber a \u0027farce.\u0027\u0027This morning´s phony National Assembly session lacked a legal quorum. There was no vote,\u0027 Assistant Secretary of State Michael Kozak said on Twitter.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, tries to climb the fence past National Guards to enter the compound of the Assembly, after he and other opposition lawmakers were blocked Guaidó said lawmakers would gather later Sunday at the headquarters of El Nacional - the country\u0027s last major opposition newspaper - where they are expected to ratify their support for him.Guaidó faced a major test in uniting articulating a new vision Sunday in his year-long campaign to remove Maduro. But his re-election for a second straight year as head of congress - the source of his legitimacy in the eyes of many in the world - had been widely expected.The weeks leading up to Sunday\u0027s vote were marked by tension, with the opposition denouncing a covert government campaign to intimidate and bribe lawmakers into voting against Guaidó.Parra is one of a small handful of lawmakers who recently broke with Guaidó and have since been expelled from their parties for alleged involvement in a corruption scandal involving allies of Maduro.Socialist lawmakers argued that Guaido\u0027s absence forced them to initiate their session without him. But all day, opposition lawmakers faced resistance by security forces who set up several barricades downtown.       National Assembly President Juan Guaido, Venezuela\u0027s opposition leader, argues with police as he and other lawmakers are stopped a few blocks from the Assembly At one checkpoint, security forces demanded that each lawmaker present their credentials, arguing they were under orders to deny entry to several lawmakers banned from carrying out their duties by the loyalist supreme court.\u0027Is your family in Venezuela?\u0027 Guaidó asked the young police officers, who stood firmly in silence.\u0027Today you´re complicit with the dictatorship, you´re complicit with those who are responsible for the hunger inside Venezuela,\u0027 he added.Support for Guaidó inside the opposition has taken a hit after several minority parties in November splintered off to create a separate bloc to negotiate directly with Maduro - something that Guaidó has refused, arguing that talks are simply a time-buying exercise aimed at keeping Maduro in power.The small group of opposition lawmakers who broke with Guaidó argue that in stubbornly sticking to a naive plan of removing Maduro by force, he has put his political ambitions above the needs of Venezuelans who have largely tuned out from the political fight while enduring an economy in shambles and under stiff U.S. sanctions.       Pro-government lawmakers hold up their fists and shout that Chavez lives, referring to late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez\u0027In 2019 you represented the hopes of the nation, but today you\u0027re its biggest deception,\u0027 said José Brito, one of the lawmakers who turned against Guaidó amid accusations they used their position to enrich themselves and do the bidding of Maduro.Guaidó declared presidential powers over Venezuela on January 23, 2019, saying Maduro\u0027s reelection was illegitimate because the most popular opposition parties and political leaders had been disqualified from running.Venezuela sits atop vast oil and mineral resources, but it has been imploding economically and socially in recent years. Critics blame the plunge on years of failed socialist rule and corruption, while Maduro\u0027s allies say U.S. sanctions are taking a toll on the economy. The South American nation\u0027s 30 million people suffer soaring inflation and shortages of gasoline, running water and electricity, among basic services.       Lawmaker José Brito speaks to the press outside the National Assembly. Brito is a critic of Guaido       The opposition-controlled National Assembly is expected to decide whether to keep Guaidó as its leader for a second year in a special session        Guaido later opened a parliamentary session on Sunday at the offices of the El Nacional newspaper after being denied entry to the National Assembly An estimated 4.5 million Venezuelans have abandoned their nation in an exodus rivaling war-torn Syria.Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of former President Hugo Chávez, says Guaidó is a puppet of the United States. Maduro also says he\u0027s determined to win control of the National Assembly in elections later this year.\u0027Despite perversions of the imperialist United States against Venezuela during 2019, we´ve managed to hold onto our independence, peace and stability,\u0027 Maduro tweeted recently.The two men remain locked in a power struggle. However, Maduro maintains military backing and control over most branches of the government, despite the deepening crisis and hard-hitting financial sanctions from the United States.\u0027Guaidó will have to not only re-energize his base and convince them to stay engaged, but keep his coalition in line as well,\u0027 said Geoff Ramsey, a researcher at the Washington Office on Latin America. \u0027And the clock is ticking.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Ricky Gervais eviscerates woke Hollywood opening speech Golden Globes","story":"Share this articleAdd some sparkle to your wardrobe with a dress by Dries Van NotenTake a closer look hereJane Fallon joined Ricky Gervais on the red carpet ahead of him hosting the Golden Globes, and we loved the elegant black gown she chose for the big night!

They\u0027re allowed to torture and maim our people. They\u0027re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we\u0027re not allowed to touch their cultural sites?

If anybody out there deserved killing, it was Qassem Soleimani.\u0027But Mr Crocker said he was \u0027concerned\u0027 about the White House\u0027s failure to warn allies of its controversial decision to kill Mr Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad last week.He said: \u0027Britain is and has been for a number of years our foremost ally.

I\u0027ve been robbing banks all over Europe and whenever I try to spend the money I have made, in the UK, the taxman wants to know where it came from. Heidi, who is global investigations editor of Buzzfeed, went on: \u0027He was introduced to a barrister who advised him that money stolen in bank heists wasn\u0027t in the schedules of taxable income and the taxman couldn\u0027t tax you on the proceeds of crime.‘So if he went to HMRC and told them that he had stolen all this money, he wouldn\u0027t be taxed. The way the law worked at the time is that anything declarations you made voluntarily you did so with immunity so that tax authorities weren\u0027t able to notify the police that this money was stolen. \u0027So this is what Scot Young did, he moved all the money into a UK account, declared this was how he made it and the taxman let him get on with spending it\u0027. Scot was part of a group of five friends — all of whom attained huge riches on deals they brokered — who all met sudden, violent deaths within four years of each other.  They were property magnates Paul Castle and Robbie Curtis ex-rock manager Johnny Elichaoff and Berezovsky, found dead at his Berkshire home in 2013 with a ligature round his neck. Mr Young had told friends he was worried someone was going to try to kill him because here was ‘a price on his head’.He served eight months in prison in 2013 after a judge jailed him for contempt of court for failing to reveal the whereabouts of the £400million fortune that was at the centre of his seven-year orce battle with his wife.           Fall: Mr Young, pictured shortly before his death necking Krug Chanpagne, went bankrupt after he made his fortune \u0027fixing\u0027 deals for the super-rich but his wife says he hid huge sums of cash              Scot Young, picture with his American girlfriend Noelle Reno, was at the centre of one of Britain’s most acrimonious orce cases, with his wife Michelle, before he died          Boris Berezovsky at the £20million Surrey mansion which he bought from Scot Young before he diedDundee-born Scot made his riches in property and gambling on telecoms - but also reportedly made large sums working as a fixer for the super-rich. He himself lived a lavish lifestyle, riding around in luxury sports cars and wearing designer clothes.He married Michelle Young in 1995 and had two children, Scarlet and Sasha, living in a 12-bedroom, 200-acre plot in Surrey.Mrs Young had previously claimed that he was \u0027worth a few billion at least\u0027 and said her husband had hidden assets of more than £400million in offshore accounts.Things started to go sour in 2006 and a protracted orce battle ensued - with Scot agreeing to marry an American-born model.But this never happened as, in 2014, he was found impaled on railings in Montagu Square, London.The cause of his death has never been ascertained and an inquest in 2015 refused to label it as suicide.In 2017 it was revealed that Scotland Yard had received a transcript of a phone call between Mr and Mrs Young that took place five weeks before his death.In the call she said she had uncovered links between him and exiled Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky. But he warned her to stop investigating his contacts and his life was in danger.Scot Young helped hide his £500million fortune from his wife \u0027in a game of hide and concealment\u0027 after instructing a Panama-based law firm, leaked documents suggested in 2016.The British tycoon used Mossack Fonseca and other offshore businesses to stash his assets in Russia, the British Virgin Islands and Monaco. "},{"url":null,"title":"Bradford","story":"Share this article Ditta, who wore a black suit and tie, spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth during the hearing, and gave his surname as Hussain. District Judge Charlotte Holland said that the alleged offences were \u0027too serious\u0027 to be dealt with by the magistrates\u0027 court and that it was necessary for them to be heard at crown court instead.Those who appeared on Monday, who are all from Halifax, are:         Two of the other defendants, Nadeem Adalat (left) and Vaseem Adalat (centre) leave Bradford Crown Court today        Sajid Adalat, 43, who is charged with rape, is pictured making a rude gesture outside Bradford Crown Court today Ditta, who is charged with sexual touchingVaqaas Abbas, 30, is charged with three counts of rape and three of supplying a class C drugNadeem Adalat, 34, faces four charges of rape and four of supply of a class C drugSajid Adalat, 43, is charged with rapeWaseem Adalat, 33, charged with two counts of rape, trafficking and supply of a class C drugChristopher Eastwood, 45, charged with two counts of rape and two counts of supply of a class C drugMahtab Islam, 46, charged with five counts of rape, three of supplying a class A drug, three of supplying a class C drug, two of sexual assault and conspiracy to pervert the course of justiceMohammed Rizwan Iqbal, 34, is charged with rapeIshtiaq Latif, 32, is charged with sexual activity with a childAsad Mahmood, 33, is charged with two counts of rape and traffickingKhalifa Mughal, 36, is charged with six counts of rape, supply of a class C drug, supply of a class A drug and conspiracy to pervert the course of justiceYounis Mohammed, 34, is charged with rape and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consentNadeem Nassir, 39, is charged with rape, supply of a class C drug and making threats to killShahzad Nowaz, 40, is charged with rape, supply of a class C drug and making threats to killShazad Nazir, 44, charged with two counts of rape and two of supply of a class C drugSohail Zafar, 36, charged with rape and supplying a class C drug.          PC Ditta, also known as PC Hussain, is pictured outside Bradford Magistrates Court today "},{"url":null,"title":"Dominos Pizza boss 23 sacked writing golliwog takeaway box","story":"Share this article \u0027He is embarrassed over what has happened.\u0027Hemingway, of Wrexham, was fined £600 with and ordered to pay £100 compensation, £85 costs and a £30 surcharge.Magistrates chair Andy Stubbs said: \u0027This is behaviour that has gone beyond banter.\u0027Some would say it was very childish behaviour in the workplace\u0027.MailOnline contacted Domino\u0027s for comment. "},{"url":null,"title":"Border Collie pup rushed surgery EATING rubber toy","story":"Share this article \u0027These swellings slow down healing and are more prone to infections.

The evolution of drone technology allows new ways of seeing, not possible even from the most manoeuvrable helicopter. The German photographer Tom Hegen has been a pioneer of such opportunities. Shooting directly downwards from a hovering near-stationary drone, he can flatten out perspective to the point that the Earth’s surface seems like a stretched canvas. His images of salt production landscapes in southern Europe give the sense that Google Earth has been hacked by abstract expressionist painters.This picture was taken above the pink lakes and white mountains of the salt industry at Aigues-Mortes near Montpellier in the south of France. Salt has been processed continuously from the marshes here since Roman times. To create table salt, seawater is channelled through 45 miles (70km) of intricate canals or roubines. The area is now restricted to visitors because of its unique ecosystem.Hegen says he was drawn to photograph here partly to document the brutal recasting of the landscape by centuries of human activity, and partly to capture the glorious geometries and colour contrasts. His picture is included in a new book, From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography. “I draw my inspiration from classic painters like Mark Rothko,” Hegen says. “I see all human beings as designers of our planet. And I see myself as a sort of framer, framing the artworks of the earth’s surface with my camera.”From Above: The Story of Aerial Photography by Eamonn McCabe and Gemma Padley is published by Laurence King (£40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c0e00f184e63458450997dfb0d5f02ed513fe7/0_369_6424_3855/master/6424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4774918f4dbe78a2a992b896c1cc225f","title":"john baldessari godfather conceptual art appreciation","story":"He told his students to write ‘I will not make boring art’ on the walls – and by burning his own work he changed the course of art historyJohn Baldessari was a towering figure in conceptual art. I mean, literally he was a towering figure: 6ft 7in to be precise. He was also incredibly important. His own work spread across painting, photography, film, video, artists’ books, billboards and public sculpture. It was shown in more than 200 solo exhibitions, 1,000 group shows, and saw him appointed a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and awarded the Golden Lion for lifetime achievement at the 2009 Venice Biennale. Yet he was equally significant owing to his teaching at the California Institute of the Arts, where David Salle, Jack Goldstein, Mike Kelley, Tony Oursler, James Welling, Analia Saban, Matt Mullican and Liz Larner were among his students. Cindy Sherman and Barbara Kruger have both cited him an important influence on their work, too.In a 2012 video which purports to be a “brief history” of the artist, narrated by Tom Waits (whom Baldessari requested personally, because he “has a great voice”), Baldessari is lauded as the “godfather of conceptual art”, the “master of appropriation” and “a surrealist for the digital age”. For an artist whose career was spent removing every trace of his own authorship, it’s ironic he’s the only one I’ve asked for an autograph: “BALDESSARI” in gappy block capitals inked in my copy of the catalogue to the artist’s 2010 Tate Modern retrospective.Before all that, however, there was a young man forging a career in the then backwater art scene of California. His family was not a rich one both Baldessari’s parents were immigrants and, after obtaining a master’s from San Diego State College, he taught first at a high school, then a community college and, one summer, a camp for juvenile delinquents. (He said his height came in useful.) In 1966, Baldessari started on a set of text paintings, which in a neat painted script lifted short phrases from tomes of art theory. “A Two-Dimensional Surface Without Any Articulation Is a Dead Experience” reads one. “Pure Beauty” another. The works rebuke the modernist trends that were setting cash tills ringing in New York, with Baldessari explicitly rejecting abstract expressionism and the fetishisation of the artist-as-lone-genius. Pushing this rebuff further, Baldessari went on to employ signwriters to create these early works. In 1968, he reproduced a copy of Artforum magazine adorned with a Frank Stella hard-edge painting on the cover, only to then commission a local man to write “This is not to be looked at” underneath.Baldessari’s decision to burn – he said “cremate is the correct word” – the abstract and landscape paintings he had been making up until 1966 is cited as the moment postmodernism finally laid modernism to rest. In 1970 Baldessari had been offered his first job at CalArts, precipitating a move from his hometown of National City to the relative bright lights of Los Angeles. Roping in a group of friends, the artist gathered all his canvases from May 1953, the month of his college graduation, to March 1966, and cut them up. Then, the remnants packed together and loaded into the back of Baldessari’s Ford Econoline van, he drove to a local crematorium and had them incinerated. The resulting ashes filled 10 bags, nine adult size, one child size.He titled that action Cremation Project, yet it proved something of a rebirth. On being invited to make a work with students at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, and unable to travel there himself, he set them homework from afar, instructing the young people to scrawl the mantra “I Will Not Make Any More Boring Art” repeatedly across the walls of the college gallery as many times as possible within 13 minutes. Baldessari was as good as that work’s promise. While over the ensuring decades his work possessed a theoretical interest in modes of communication, modern media studies and the relationship between text and image, it was never earnest.“What if you just give people what they want? People read magazines, and look at photographs, not at Jackson Pollocks,” he said in a 2010 interview. On the subject of his series Commissioned Paintings, for which Baldessari employed 12 amateur artists to make his work for him, he likewise noted: “I felt that art didn’t have to be about the touch of the artist, you could be an art director, or strategist.” For all its intellectual integrity, Baldessari’s work borrows from the immediacy of advertising and graphic design. This collision between pop culture and high art is exemplified in the 1976 work Two Stares Making a Point But Blocked By a Plane (For Malevich), in which the artist obscured a large section of a found black-and-white photograph with a white collaged square of card tilted on one corner. The result leaves the two men who were the subject of the original image staring askance at a massive blank void.Baldessari would go on to employ the trick of partially covering found images with planes of colour throughout his career, most famously obscuring the faces of B-movie actors and society folk in old found photos with red, yellow or blue adhesive circles. His aim, the artist said, was to concentrate the viewer’s attention on body language present in these otherwise unremarkable photos. By his own estimation, it is the work that, if he was at all, he would be remembered for in a hundred years. Yet he did himself a disservice. Baldessari was one of a handful of visionaries who dragged art out of the self-congratulatory mid-20th century academy, challenging his peers to make work that held its own in a real world – already saturated with images."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949976fc53b187fa154ae48315a8366f02ff5068/0_722_9294_5577/master/9294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1177a5ce83fecad5bc3b615da5dbf3","title":"original observer photography","story":"Stormzy, Robert Pattinson, fashion and clowns – the best photography commissioned by the Observer in December 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b320210c8b0d5b8a2eb5aaedb32f14dec366ad6/0_409_5904_3543/master/5904.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad76b37c68ab5e48b200dd4c4ffa51ae","title":"the playful modernism of designer george him in pictures","story":"Jerzy Himmelfarb was an acclaimed graphic designer in his native Poland and later Germany before changing his name to George Him and moving to London in 1937, where he stayed throughout the second world war. “He was influential as an advocate for the value of graphic design as a creative practice and a way to connect with people, says Olivia Ahmad, curator of a new exhibition of Him’s wartime propaganda posters, packaging design and children’s illustrations.

Typically represented as percentage growth rates, like-for-like sales measure sales at stores that have been open for at least a year, stripping out the impact of sales at newer stores. The idea is that they allow a more transparent comparison of a retailer’s sales performance over a certain period of time, when compared with the same period of time a year earlier.However, there is no formal industry standard. This means that some companies include new extensions to stores in their like-for-like sales, while others include sales generated by a customer paying with a voucher. Critics of the measure say that like-for-like sales do not always give an accurate picture of a retailer’s health. They argue that of greater relevance is profitability and how well a company is adapting to challenges such as the living wage and online shopping revolution.Aldi has been rapidly opening stores as it aims to increase its UK chain from 874 shops to 1,200 by 2025. The growth has weighed on profits as it pours money into new stores and cutting prices to lift sales. Figures published in September showed that Aldi’s 2018 profits fell by almost a fifth as it invested £530m in expansion.Giles Hurley, the Aldi UK chief executive, said: “More customers than ever before shopped with us this Christmas.

This is generally interpreted as also avoiding products that are cooked with meat.The marketing director of the fast-food chain, Katie Evans, described the product as a “game-changer”.“We wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and we’re thrilled with the result,” she said. “We’re delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK.”The burger, made in conjunction with meat-free food company the Vegetarian Butcher, has tomatoes, lettuce, mayonnaise, ketchup, pickles on a seeded bun, with a patty made from soy – a common meat substitute.Growing awareness of the impact of meat and dairy production on the climate has contributed to a spike in veganism in recent years, with the UN a long-standing advocate of reducing animal product consumption.Last year, 250,000 people pledged to go vegan in January, with vegan celebrities including Venus Williams, Zac Efron and Ariana Grande credited with raising the profile of the movement.The Rebel Whopper launch comes after Greggs’ debut of its vegan steak bake, a meat-substitute version of its popular pastry, in partnership with vegetarian food brand Quorn.The sandwich chain Subway has also made attempts to capitalise on a growing trend towards dairy, egg, and meat-free diets, adding a vegan marinara meatball sandwich to its offering , after launching a vegan patty in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec5f7497cc900d8ffbbe1366a850ef779548ef9a/0_99_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4353ab52c6a390a945898957183e03f","title":"yvette cooper seven things labour must do party leader","story":"Labour’s leadership contest starts on Tuesday.

So here are seven things the whole Labour party must now do.1 Face the scale of defeat with humilityWe didn’t win the argument, we lost. For the fourth time in a row. The Tory party has more power now than for a quarter of a century – power to hurt the families, communities and public services we were fighting for.Our socialist party lost the majority of the working-class vote and fell behind in the very industrial towns that forged Labour and were hardest hit by Tory austerity. Labour values on equality, solidarity and social justice matter more than ever, and many people are crying out for a progressive government. But we couldn’t persuade people this time and unless we get our act together, we could lose even more support in future.It wasn’t just about perceptions of Jeremy Corbyn. Or Brexit. Or scepticism about our manifesto. It was about the fact that on every one of those issues a gulf has grown between the party and the voters we lost. The next leader has to bridge that gap but they won’t stand a chance of doing so if the rest of us pretend it doesn’t exist.2 Stop the factional infightingWe cannot be a narrow hard-left party. That doesn’t reflect our values or history. Nor will we win next time if we collapse into polarised factional infighting. Parties are teams. If we can’t compromise with each other, we can’t hold any coalition of voters together.I stood against Jeremy last time – and while I agreed with him on tackling inequality and climate change, I criticised him on security and credibility. I was proud to be a minister in the last Labour government – a government that some current shadow cabinet members have strongly criticised.As a result, whether fair or not, I recognise there are many in our party who won’t see me as the person to pull all sides of the party together following Jeremy’s departure. And rebuilding towards a Labour government is more important than any one person. So I am really grateful to everyone who urged me to stand again but this isn’t the time for me to do so. However, I’m not going anywhere – the next leader needs support and we all need to keep fighting for the Labour government our country so badly needs.3 Be a party for the whole country – not just a liberal-labour party for the citiesBeing a broad church isn’t just about left and centre. Through our history we’ve included Fabians, trades unionists, Methodists and Marxists, middle class and working class, city and town, young and old, liberal and communitarian.Right now both the left and the centre wings of our party are concentrated in the cities, appealing to younger, more liberal and more middle-class voters – but drifting away from older, working class voters in towns. Brexit put that problem on steroids as leave voters in towns such as mine in Yorkshire felt neither Jeremy Corbyn nor Tony Blair were listening to them.I’m worried too that some members from all sides of the party are criticising candidates for talking about patriotism. Of course we should be patriotic – if Labour can’t show people we love our country, we won’t ever get to be in government again.4 Learn to love the achievements of the last Labour governmentIf we keep slagging off the last Labour government, why are we surprised if voters don’t want another one? On the doorstep when we pointed out Tory failures, too often people responded “yeah, but was Labour any better?” Actually yes – GP appointments within two days not two weeks, fewer kids in poverty, more police officers, more buses, fewer people sleeping on the street, more investment in our towns … I could go on.Of course Labour’s future programme needs to be more radical and ambitious for the 2020s and not go back to 1997. Of course there are things that the last Labour government got wrong. But we also need to show how Labour can make a difference.5 Be a strong and credible opposition, as well as a radical alternative governmentBoris Johnson’s government has to be held to account through forensic scrutiny – and that involves all of us, not just the new leader. Opposition is hard work but it matters. At stake is our NHS, our public services, the future of manufacturing industry. Britain is leaving the EU at the end of January and our future trading relationships will be crucial. We also have to be credible as an alternative government. It isn’t enough to admit the manifesto was too crowded and wasn’t believed if we still freak out when the leadership candidates tell us we can’t have every new policy we want. Socialism is still the language of priorities.6 Bring kindness and integrity back into politicsThe next leader must take strong action against antisemitism and they need all our support in doing so to stop racism or prejudice corroding our soul. But all of us have a responsibility to stop the abuse on and offline. I’ve seen those on both the left and centre of our party accused by other members of being traitors. We should leave that kind of vitriol behind and stand up for something better.Don’t despair. The first election I campaigned in was 1992 and afterwards I feared we would never win again. But I remember John Smith saying to young activists: “As long as people like you still join and fight for our party, I know we have a future.”We are further behind than in 1992 and face bigger challenges, not least in Scotland. But we also still have great strengths and passion, amazing activists who worked hard for every vote and believe in a better Britain. And it feels like things change faster now so who knows what we can achieve if we try. So join. Or rejoin. Be part of this.Those who built the Labour party more than a century ago created something incredible – a party for ordinary decent people who believe we must stand together when one of us is struggling. We won’t stop fighting for social justice. When we are strong, when we are broad, we change the world. That’s what we must do again.• Yvette Cooper is the Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd5ef6d7c7a250fe4dca95a4b7e301f880503faf/0_245_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02ff7b6bb48fbaacadbfe30e1855ae1e","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of pure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘pure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘pure’.Share your photos of what pure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 8 January at 10am.

The meandering drive – stretching more than 120 miles from Mossel Bay in the west, to Storms River in the east – takes in dappled forests, still lakes and surf-pummeled beaches. It’s best explored on four wheels, but be sure to take your time. British Airways flies direct to Cape Town, where you can pick up an Avis hire car, belt up and settle into a truly picturesque ride.Humpback whales can often be spotted breaching clear out of the water at Hermanus, just a 90-minute drive from Cape Town. You can even spot whales lolling metres from the shoreline – keep your ears primed for the huff of a humpback whale exhaling right by your feet. The town hosts an annual whale festival each September – when huge southern right whales pass by in large numbers – and there’s even a whale crier, who alerts crowds to the presence of the animals by blowing on a kelp horn. July to October is a great time to see pods of migrating mothers with their calves and, if you’re feeling languid, the Marine Hotel is perfectly situated on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, so you’ll be able to spot barnacle-clad beasts from your balcony.A 40-minute trundle down the road, you’ll find Gansbaai. Known by locals as the Serengeti of the sea, the waters here are bristling with sea creatures, including the marine big five: whales, dolphins, seals, penguins and sharks. The latter can be seen in their menacing masses in Shark Alley – a sliver of ocean that roils with cape fur seals, the great white’s favourite prey.It’s a four-hour journey from Gansbaai to Oudtshoorn, but you’ll have plenty of screensaver scenery to gawp at along the way, including the craggy Tradouw mountain pass and the twisty-turny Huisrivier pass, which clings to the side of a mountain where cape leopards still roam. As well as the Cango Caves – an impressive prehistoric limestone system, dripping with troll-like rock formations, stalagmites and stalactites – Oudtshoorn boasts the largest number of ostriches in the world, with many of the farms offering tractor rides or walks out in the fields with the colossal birds.Head almost due south towards the coast and you’ll soon reach Knysna – a charming holiday town right at the heart of the Garden Route. Here, you’ll find a vast aquamarine lagoon spilling out into the ocean from between two huge sandstone headlands, helpfully known as the Heads. Hike through the lush forest – thought of as the lungs of this beautiful town – or take a trip out on to the water where you can fish, kayak, water ski and swim.A half-hour drive east is Plettenberg Bay. Home to the rocky Robberg Nature Reserve – where you can snorkel with rambunctious seals – a satisfyingly sandy central beach and the Nelson Bay caves, which date back to the stone age. This is also a great place to take part in a township tour (run by Ocean Blue Adventures). Meet up with a local from the Qolweni community and join them on a visit to the township’s Siyakhula crèche, the central shebeen and other lively spots, meeting some of the friendly locals and learning about the township’s rich history along the way. Come evening, stay at the remarkable Tsala Treetop Lodge just out of town – a collection of elegant elevated hideaways decked out in Afro-baroque style and hidden among the canopy of the ancient indigenous forest.Locals like to call Tsitsikamma, just north of Storms River – “the garden of the Garden Route”. An old Khoisan word, Tsitsikamma means “place of much water”, and whether it’s the yawning river valleys, the flinty ocean or the dew-daubed forest that clings to the mountains, this place is most certainly lush. Don your hiking boots for a lung-cleansing hike around this beautiful landscape, then make your final drive to Storms River, where – if the mood strikes – you can mark the end of your epic road trip by hurling yourself off the Bloukrans Bridge – the world’s highest bridge to bungee off.How to bookWith direct flights from London to Cape Town, British Airways Holidays can help make your South Africa fly-drive unforgettable.

A cheap glut of natural gas has displaced coal, with 612 gas-fired units coming online during this time.“When you turn coal units off you see deaths go down. It’s something we can see in a tangible way,” said Jennifer Burney, a University of California academic who authored the study. “There is a cost to coal beyond the economics. We have to think carefully about where plants are sited, as well as how to reduce their pollutants.”While a swift transition away from coal is seen by experts as imperative to limit global heating and the worst impacts of the climate crisis, there is a counterintuitive short-term local increase in warming once coal plants are shut down. This is because these plants emit aerosols that scatter sunlight, slightly cooling the surface.The natural gas that is replacing coal is “not entirely benign”, Burney’s research points out. Gas is, like coal, a fossil fuel and its production involves the release of vast amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.Previous research has shown that both coal and gas will need to be rapidly replaced by zero carbon alternatives such as solar and wind, or to at least deploy technology that captures emissions, if the world is to avoid more disastrous global heating.The Trump administration, however, has sought to prop up the ailing coal industry in the US and has rolled back Obama-era standards aimed at curtailing pollution from coal-fired power plants.“Particulate pollution from coal still kills thousands of Americans yearly and hundreds of thousands of people worldwide,” said Rob Jackson, a climate and environment expert at Stanford University who wasn’t involved in the study. “Rolling back emissions standards won’t just harm the climate, it will kill people, especially poorer people more likely to live near coal-fired power plants.Thomas Burke, a former Environmental Protection Agency official responsible for clean air, said Burney’s study “provides a new lens for viewing the broad impacts of coal on our health, agriculture and climate”.“Clearly the policies of the current EPA leadership, to turn back the clock and support the coal industry, have broad ranging negative impacts on public health and our environment,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b793797cc3066387e18362d5b274b5790b6d57b/0_290_4345_2607/master/4345.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d90e18886b930b5bdd29efcec03f95e","title":"urgent new roadmap to recovery could reverse insect apocalypse aoe","story":"Phasing out synthetic pesticides and fertilisers and aggressive emission reductions among series of solutions outlined by scientistsThe world must eradicate pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and urgently reduce water, light and noise pollution to save plummeting insect populations, according to a new “roadmap to insect recovery” compiled by experts.The call to action by more than 70 scientists from across the planet advocates immediate action on human stress factors to insects which include habitat loss and fragmentation, the climate crisis, pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species.Phasing out synthetic pesticides and fertilisers used in industrial farming and aggressive greenhouse gas emission reductions are among a series of urgent “no-regret” solutions to reverse what conservationists have called the “unnoticed insect apocalypse”.Insects are crucial to the health of functioning ecosystems that are vital for food production and security. Pollinators like bees get a lot of attention because three quarters of crops producing fruit and seeds for human consumption depend on them, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization. Other types of insects include herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids and predators that are crucial to ecosystems humans rely on to survive, acting as pest controllers, recycling nutrients and performing other tasks.How do humans harm insects?Habitat loss and fragmentation, pollution, invasive species, the climate crisis and over-harvesting are all human-caused issues that put pressure on insects, say experts. The heavy use of synthetic pesticides and fertilisers is the primary driver of harm to insects by humans, according to the first global scientific review of the literature in 2019.What happens if insects become extinct? The survival of mankind would be at stake. With no insects to pollinate the crops humans rely on to eat or perform vital functions in ecosystems, humans would be in trouble.What can we do about it?Insect experts have devised a roadmap for conservation and recovery. In the short term, humans must phase out pesticide use, prioritise nature-based farming methods and reduce light, noise and water pollution. In the long term, scientists have called for an international body to monitor the health of insect populations and action taken to help them.Alongside these measures, scientists must urgently establish which herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids, predators and pollinators are priority species for conservation, according to a new paper published in Nature Ecology \u0026amp Evolution. The animals are crucial to the healthy functioning of ecosystems by recycling nutrients, serving as pollinators and acting as food for other wildlife.In July 2017, researchers warned human overpopulation and overconsumption were driving the sixth mass extinction event in world history, pointing to the “biological annihilation” of wildlife.Lead author Prof Jeff Harvey of the Netherlands Institute of Ecology and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, said: “As scientists, we want to gather all available knowledge and put it to action together with land managers, policymakers and everyone else involved. “Essentially, we are thinking strategically and this is novel. Now and down the road, all to reverse insect declines.“Most importantly, we hope that end-users and land managers now can use this roadmap in, for instance, farming, habitat management and urban development as a template for true insect recovery.”The scientists have called on governments to follow the example of Germany, which announced a €100m action plan for insect protection in September 2019, adding that there is a strong consensus among experts that the decline of insects, other arthropods and global bioersity is a serious threat that society must address.In the short term, the roadmap advocates immediate action on rewilding and conservation programmes, avoiding and mitigating the impact of alien species and prioritising imports that are not produced at the cost of species-rich ecosystems. Enhancing citizen science projects to improve data quality and inform academic study was also deemed a priority.“Most importantly, we should not wait to act until we have addressed every key knowledge gap. We currently have enough information on some key causes of insect decline to formulate no-regret solutions whilst more data are compiled for lesser known taxa and regions and long-term data are aggregated and assessed,” the roadmap states.“Implementation should be accompanied by research that examines impacts, the results of which can be used to modify and improve the implementation of effective measures. Furthermore, such a ‘learning-by-doing’ approach ensures that these conservation strategies are robust to newly emerging pressures and threats. We must act now.”In the long term, the scientists are calling for the establishment of an international body to document and monitor the effects of the roadmap on insect bioersity under the auspices of existing bodies such as the United Nations Environment Programme and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Public-private partnerships to restore, protect and create new insect habitats and manage threats are also advocated by the roadmap.Coauthors on the roadmap for insect conservation recovery originate from Europe, North America, South and Central America, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Asia. They include biology professor Dave Goulson, known for his books on the ecology of bees and other insects, and scientist Hans de Kroon, renowned for his work on insect biomass decline.Light pollution has also emerged as an overlooked driver of plummeting insect populations by luring them to predators, affecting the development of juvenile insects and disrupting light and dark cycles, according to a study published in November 2019. Scientists said insect deaths could be reduced by switching off unnecessary lights.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be76066b773a2e02009345064bec03087f89d29/0_162_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d61de1396c04ef20f36f0192055e403","title":"why irish data centre boom complicating climate efforts","story":"Surge in processing industry will increase Ireland’s already too high carbon emissionsInside Digital Realty’s Dublin data centre, racks of shiny black servers throb and whirr as unseen fans cool machines that steadily process unending data.It operates 24 hours a day from the business park, sited on a former orchard, and the data joins a digital torrent in an underground fibre ring network that sweeps around the Irish capital and connects to undersea cables – the physical backbones of the digital world.It is not just for Ireland. This is also how the UK and continental Europe accesses a lot of email, social media, online shopping, Netflix and other internet services. “Everything with the word smart in front of it has a data centre behind it,” said Ben Bryan, Digital Realty’s technical operations manager in Dublin.But there is a catch. The surge in Irish data processing will require significant new energy infrastructure and increase emissions, complicating Ireland’s response to the climate crisis. The cloud can create carbon: it is estimated that when the music video Despacito reached 5bn streamed YouTube views in 2018, the energy consumption was equivalent to powering 40,000 US homes a year (it has now exceeded 6.5bn views).It is already Europe’s data centre capital, with Amazon, Google and Microsoft siting operations there. Dozens of centres have opened in recent years, bringing the total to 54, with a combined power capacity of 642MW. Once a leading exporter of floppy discs and CD-Roms, Ireland has successfully transitioned to the big data era.It is just the beginning. With the state’s blessing another 10 centres are under construction, including a €1bn (£845m) Amazon hub in Mulhuddart, west Dublin, that together will add 202MW. Another 31 centres have planning permission, which would add 629MW. There has been one setback: planning approval delays prompted Apple to scrap a planned €850m (£743m) centre last year.“The data centre industry is growing so fast it’s hard to fathom,” said Patrick Bresnihan, a geography professor at Maynooth University in Ireland. “But somehow the tech companies get far less attention than aviation or fossil fuel companies.”Ireland faces a dilemma. The expanding web of data centres is part of a strategy to anchor tech companies that drive economic growth. They have been designated as “critical infrastructure”, facilitating planning approval. “Data centre presence in Ireland raises our visibility internationally as a technology-rich, innovative economy,” said a spokesperson for the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation (DoBEI).But the boom will exact a price. Ireland is one of the EU’s worst carbon emission offenders and faces fines of more than €250m for missing 2020 targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Missing later targets will trigger steeper fines.Ireland’s data centres have a low profile. They tend to operate from anonymous-looking business parks with high-security perimeter fences and intruder detection alarms. A Google centre has colourful murals but the rest are grey and nondescript, with discreet signage.Digital Realty, whose headquarters is in San Francisco, has a relatively small centre in Profile Park, part of a cluster in west Dublin. Its two data halls are powered by 9MW, a fraction of some neighbours but enough to require an electricity substation.It powers the servers and fans which during winter suck in cool air from outside. If the power – and cooling – stopped the machines would swiftly overheat, said Bryan. That has never happened but just in case there are backup diesel generators on the roof.Google and Amazon representatives also said their Irish data centres were energy efficient and entirely supplied by – or soon would be - renewable energy. Earlier this year Amazon Web Services announced backing for a 91.2MW windfarm in Donegal and a 23.2MW windfarm in Cork.Such deals could act as a catalyst for renewable energy investment, said the DoBEI, citing a 2018 government report.Asked about the estimated 1.5m tonnes of carbon emissions, it replied: “The department is not in a position to comment on the accuracy or otherwise of the estimates of the IAE study, which it is not a party to.”Bresnihan, the academic, said Ireland’s dependence on big tech companies should not obscure their environmental cost. “If they left Ireland would be in a pretty bad situation but there’s only so long you can put off these contradictions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09494110b22da6452008c5d2ba42b78ceee721aa/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adaf771bd77c2fa6aa35c5e50fadd2f7","title":"harvey weinstein trial metoo movement","story":"Legal teams decry each other’s behavior as ‘abominable’ and ‘humiliating’ on opening day of trial on five sexual assault countsThe rape trial of the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein began on Monday in Manhattan and immediately erupted into furious name-calling between lawyers, who decried each other’s behaviour as “abominable”, “degrading” and “humiliating”.It was a sign of the high stakes involved in a trial that marks the next chapter in the #MeToo movement triggered by allegations of sexual misconduct by the movie producer two years ago.Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to five counts that include raping a woman in 2013 and forcing another woman to engage in oral sexual conduct in 2006. The most serious charge is predatory sexual assault, carrying a maximum sentence of life.Outside court, a group of accusers including the actors Rose McGowan and Rosanna Arquette stared as Weinstein got out of his car. Some were holding signs that said “Listen to survivors” and “Justice for survivors”. Surrounded by his legal team, hunched over a gray metal walker, Weinstein hurried into the building.Inside, he sat on the defense benches. He was only 10ft from Gloria Allred, the campaigning attorney who represents two women who will testify. The pair did not make eye contact.The trial is set to be one of the most high-profile judicial events of the century, its cast drawn from Hollywood’s high table. More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct, the actors Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow among them.The case is also of intimate importance to all who have endured sexual harassment in the workplace. For them, the movement triggered by the Weinstein revelations in October 2017 has become a driving force for change.For Weinstein, the stakes could not be higher. Though his fall has been dramatic, he has avoided personal punishment. Last month a $25m settlement was reached involving more than 30 women. To the dismay of some, the deal did not touch Weinstein’s own money or require him to admit guilt.The most serious charge is predatory sexual assault. To secure a guilty verdict, prosecutors will have to convince the jury the producer engaged in a pattern of sexual crimes over time.The judge in New York county supreme court, James Burke, has indicated he will allow three other women to testify including Sopranos actor Annabella Sciorra, who alleges Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 1993. Though that incident is beyond the statute of limitations, it can be presented as evidence of alleged predatory behaviour.On Monday, the hearing erupted in dispute. In one exchange, lead prosecutor Joan Illuzzi-Orbon accused Weinstein’s attorneys of “abominable” behaviour which “degraded and humiliated” the accusers.“In the last 72 hours it has been in our opinion abominable to talk about evidence, to talk about sealed discovery in public, to talk about witnesses in a humiliating way,” Illuzzi-Orbon said.She pointed to a conversation in which one of Weinstein’s legal team cast aspersions on an accuser. “If you say things like, ‘She’s a good actress, I’m sure she will come off well, she’s performing, or that she’s lying, or that it was a loving intimate relationship …’”The prosecutor said evidence would be presented that would discount any claim of intimacy between Weinstein and his alleged victims.“I can assure you that was not the case,” she said, “and we will show that.”The judge turned to one of Weinstein’s lawyers and said: “So what did you do, Miss Rotunno?”Donna Rotunno said: “I did nothing improper. I have been professional, I have been respectful and I have done my job.”Burke issued an edict to both parties: “Leave the witnesses alone. Do not talk about them in any capacity.”The issue of how the women who will testify have been treated also came up in regard to Black Cube, a corporate intelligence company run largely by former officers of Israeli intelligence. The New Yorker journalist Ronan Farrow revealed that Weinstein employed Black Cube to make contact with accusers as a way of extracting information.The prosecutor requested the court to order Weinstein’s lawyers to tell the jury Black Cube contacted witnesses. The prosecution also revealed that they wished to present the jury with photographs relating to one accuser. There are 72, they said, though they intend to admit seven.“We have minimalised any undue prejudices” in the images, Illuzzi-Orbon said. “We do feel the they are very, very important for the jury to see.”The judge reserved his ruling.Weinstein’s team protested that they were not being given sufficient evidentiary material. In particular they protested that medical records of one of the accusers, including notes of a visit to a hospital emergency room, were heavily redacted.A Weinstein attorney said: “The state says this is a sensitive matter for the complaining witnesses – no doubt. But it is also a sensitive matter for Mr Weinstein. It affects his ability to defend himself.”The case was adjourned until Tuesday, when jury selection begins. That is expected to take up to two weeks.Outside, the accusers who call themselves the “silence breakers” spoke to reporters. McGowan read an open letter to Weinstein.“You thought you could terrorise me and others into silence,” she said. “You were wrong. That we’ve come to this moment of justice is staggering. The trial means so much to so many.”McGowan was joined by six other women, including Arquette, Lauren Sivan and Sarah Ann Masse. They responded to Weinstein’s comments to the New York Post in December, in which he lamented that his work “promoting women has been forgotten”.“For every woman he put on the screen, he took out about a hundred behind the scenes,” McGowan said.Masse noted that when Weinstein walked into court, “he wouldn’t look at us, he wouldn’t make eye contact. Nothing has changed. He’s a coward.” To Arquette, he looked like a “very broken man”.McGowan added: “I think he has taken some good acting tips.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c2c9373339e00c57738f4d79e520be7580f1c1/0_194_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b6b90b5ec32916daa89426219e405a0","title":"golden globes after parties in pictures","story":"Winners and nominees celebrate after the awards at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f4779ab2fa69087a38b5e28eedb8caa10354565/0_2819_5683_3410/master/5683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1b629aab46b3e5e790532d48e3fa0c8","title":"thomasina miers gluten free ethiopian lentil spinach soup recipe","story":"A spicy, aromatic soup with Ethiopian berbere spices taking centre stageWe spent a week in Greece last summer.

The announcement was made on two further occasions in line with Premier League protocols.However, a statement from Tottenham on Monday confirmed that they and the politan Police have ended their investigations having reviewed all available footage.“The club and the politan Police have now exhausted all avenues of investigation following the reported incident at our home fixture against Chelsea on 22 December,” read the statement.“We carried out extensive reviews of CCTV images and footage, working with professional lip readers. All materials and reports have now also been reviewed by the police who have carried out their own investigation.“The police have notified us today that, having reviewed and investigated, they have closed the crime report as they can find no evidence to support the allegation of racial abuse. We fully support Antonio Rüdiger with the action that he took - however there is no evidence to corroborate or contradict the allegation and as such neither ourselves nor the police are in a position to take any further action.“We are fiercely proud of our anti-racism work and our zero tolerance of any form of discrimination. This is one reason why we have attributed so much time and resource to investigating this matter.

Her arrival at Chelsea feels like a gamechanger: the Australian is in her prime and it is the first time a player at her level has come over from the American league. We have seen Carli Lloyd, who played for Manchester City at a later stage of her career, and a few less-celebrated names make the switch but this signing feels different. The Women’s Super League is competing with NWSL to be the best league in the world and people everywhere will have sat up and taken notice.So it was important Kerr got off to a good start and Chelsea will be very happy with her performance in the 3-1 win against Reading. She provided an assist and was fouled in the incident that saw Grace Moloney, the Reading keeper, sent off. It is clear Chelsea went all out to sign the player many people believe is the best in the world. They want to get back into the Champions League and ultimately win it this was a very promising first appearance and, if we assume Kerr can only get even better with more games, it sets up a fascinating title race.Casey Stoney will be absolutely fuming with Manchester United after their home defeat to Bristol City, but it could be the kind of result that makes their season. United had been consistent, if not spectacular, in their first top-flight campaign they’d dominated the teams they should beat and hadn’t disgraced themselves against the big names. But this should have been a home banker and if there was any complacency then Saturday’s result will surely have smartened them up. They had numerous chances and should have taken at least one United expect a team of winners and that means being ruthless. If this setback hardens them up then it might yet define their campaign they are still a team I fancy to make a strong Cup run.While we expect more of United nowadays, that is not to dismiss Bristol City. This was their first win of the season and breathes real life into their relegation battle. They don’t have the same big-brother backing from a men’s Premier League team and the people who have built their club up deserve massive respect. Belief can start to fade a bit when the harsh reality of your situation sets in, so this was a monumental result.Arsenal cruised past Birmingham and never had to get into top gear. They remain the team to beat and it was encouraging to see how they mixed things up to good effect. Their first goal, from Kim Little, came from a wonderful ball from Vivianne Miedema but I liked the way their second came from a more direct approach. Leah Williamson got her head up from centre-back and played a great long pass from which Jordan Nobbs scored, and it does no harm to use the length of the pitch like that. It makes them unpredictable and even more dangerous, particularly when many opponents will focus particularly keenly on stopping Miedema.They could have scored more. We know they are capable of it, because they put 11 past Bristol City and it was as if they decided to go out that day to bolster their goal difference. Maybe they need a bit of a nudge to put in more clinical displays and top teams will punish you if you don’t convert enough opportunities, particularly in the Champions League. But overall, this was a case of Joe Montemurro’s side starting 2020 as they left off in 2019 – sometimes making the game look easy.Brighton edged past Liverpool in a real six-pointer and, given the scarcity of wins down at the bottom, it gives their hopes of avoiding relegation a massive boost. But Liverpool are not down and out yet. They are looking more offensive and inventive these days, having struggled to create chances early on in the season, and will be encouraged by the debut Rachel Furness made in midfield. Furness has joined from Reading and, if Liverpool are to stay up, it is a fair bet she will be key to their revival. She spent the first part of this season on loan at Spurs and I don’t think they would be where they are now – safely in mid-table – without her influence. She is a real linchpin with great energy, set-pieces and an eye for goal. It was a tremendous coup to sign her and, despite their lowly position, Liverpool will feel energised going into a huge home game against Manchester United.Pauline Bremer scored two more goals for Manchester City in their 4-1 win at Spurs, making it seven in seven WSL games this season and 13 in 14 overall. Nobody expected too much after such a long time out injured, but she is proving the “like a new signing” cliché to be right. Her first goal came after a lovely touch away from a defender and she added another before half-time in a match where City were dominant from start to finish. With Ellen White – who also scored at Tottenham – back and in form too, City should be an attacking force to reckon with from hereon and I feel they needed that, because they have gone a little stagnant in some ways. Their potentially decisive home match against Arsenal is less than a month away and if they can keep up this form, with two refreshed and energised forwards, then it could be game on in the title race.Everton’s visit to West Ham was called off after a flu outbreak in the hosts’ squad, and that’s certainly not something I ever encountered in my career. It means Everton must wait a few more days to see Izzy Christiansen in action. Christiansen could be a huge acquisition for them: she was a top player at Manchester City and took a gamble going to Lyon, where she hasn’t had the playing time she wanted. I’m sure she could have stayed with the French club and earned more money sitting on the bench, but she wants to play football and get back into the England fold. She knows Everton well, having started out there, and it’s a move that shows their ambition. They have almost sleepwalked their way through the last three or four years but those days look as if they are over. They have a burning ambition to be back among the top sides again and it will be intriguing to see how they get on this weekend, when they travel to City and the story might just be written to Christiansen to make headlines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc3d03308cb867694524c6b17b38061b9df4c8d6/0_44_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c17abb4649f95ae1f0a6abbc21c71f4a","title":"how weight loss surgery saved my life","story":"I have felt fat since I was eight years old. But a gastric sleeve procedure gave me the head start I needed and finally put health and happiness in sightI don’t remember a time when I didn’t feel fat. While I started piling on the pounds in my late teens, I was teased as young as eight for being chubby. The idea stuck. I remember overhearing my mum saying that she was worried I would get anorexia: I didn’t even know what that was. Suffice to say, I never did. I felt fat long before I truly had a fat body, but eventually the latter caught up with the former. I tried to diet on and off from my late teens to my late 30s, but nothing stuck. I was deeply, painfully unhappy.I didn’t have a boyfriend throughout my 20s. Then, aged 30, I met my now ex-husband online, but that relationship was not without its complexities and I continued to gain weight. We got married in 2008. When we split up in 2013, I lost control and lived on junk food for a summer. I have always been an emotional eater and it was a vicious cycle. I was unhappy because I was fat, I ate because I was unhappy, then I gained weight because I ate.Then I made a decision to save my own life. I went to my GP and, as always, they asked about my weight – at 162kg (25 and a half stone), I was morbidly obese. This time, the doctor suggested weight-loss surgery.At first, I balked. I had never been to hospital for anything more serious than a broken bone, never stayed overnight or had surgery. At my weight, there were serious risks of complications and a small but real possibility I could die on the table. I remember walking down the street to work and stopping in my tracks at the thought of that.But as I walked down the street I was in agony – a fact I never shared with anyone, although I suspect they knew. I couldn’t walk for more than a minute without being in extreme pain. My back would seize up and my shins would burn from the strain I was putting them under. I knew I had to do something.So, in December 2013, I went to hospital for gastric sleeve surgery. This is where a large part of your stomach is cut away so you can eat only small portions before you get full. The surgery took four hours. Afterwards, I had to be woken every few hours and made to walk up and down the corridor because of the risk of deep vein thrombosis. The discomfort was bad for a week and I had a month of recovery before I could return to work.People can be really weird about weight-loss surgery. Some think it is a “cheat”. Others think that I have wasted NHS money, despite the fact that I’ve probably saved them a fortune in treating the complications that might otherwise have arisen from my obesity. As a society, we make such moral judgments around weight gain and loss and the right and wrong ways of doing it. People treated me as a failure when I was fat despite my good job and life. People laud my weight loss when they see it, but there is sometimes a sense of disappointment in me when they realise it wasn’t done through what they determine as willpower.But it was. The surgery is only the start. I have met people for whom it didn’t work who cheated the surgery. Having the surgery doesn’t guarantee success – it gives you a head start. You still have to commit to your weight loss and work bloody hard at it.That head start was what I needed. A chance to see a difference quickly and to turn my downward spiral into a positive feedback loop. One month after the surgery, I was walking for 30 minutes or more without pain. I now walk everywhere I can, trying to get at least 10,000 steps a day.The stomach is a muscle, so after a while it stretches back to a normal size. I can now eat standard portions of food (although nothing like what I used to consume). I am not yet at my ideal weight and have joined Slimming World to get to my target, which is 16kg lighter than I am now.I used to be a size 30 now I am a size 14. I used to loathe shopping now I love it. The feeling of there being choices available to me that there never used to be is exhilarating. I used to avoid walking with others because the pain I was hiding made me quiet and unsocial now I regularly tramp around the marshes near my home for miles with family and friends. Whereas I used to go home alone, now my life is, at times, full of dating and fun.I have a confidence I never used to. I know things about me that were hidden under layers of fat and insecurity. I like my face now it has angles. I am even learning to like myself. It is hard and I don’t know if I will feel completely at ease with myself, even when I do achieve that final loss. But I no longer hate myself – and that is a powerful feeling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6d0781c03a2cab64b964756bd5c1b6facd179eb/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=982b8cb9309548aad68150c8072b2414","title":"myself is not my i today what can we learn from chris evans extraordinary life advice","story":"The radio DJ is now very much enlightened. So can we all become millionaires like him if we devote ourselves to Eckhart Tolle and learn the power of ‘I’?How would any of us know it was new year if the papers weren’t full of articles about how to improve ourselves written by people so clueless about life that they opted for the media as a long-term career? Such guidance has been especially prevalent this year, maybe because it’s a new decade or maybe because these kinds of articles are a lot easier and cheaper to produce than proper investigative journalism – who really can say? But I would like to draw everyone’s attention to one article published over the weekend, about how we can all lead better lives, written by none other than British radio’s own Chris Evans (as opposed to Hollywood’s own Chris Evans). Because, truly, no one is better qualified to give life guidance than a man who, in 2000, at the age of 34, gave the then 18-year-old Billie Piper a silver Ferrari, even though she didn’t know how to drive.Ah, but that’s all very much in the past, Evans assures us, because he is now ENLIGHTENED. He proves this at some length in an article that itself seems to defy the very notion of space and time, with observations including: “Newton saw his falling apple one day and declared: ‘Look! Gravity!’ That was his identity that day, he became the gravity guy. But what about the tree whence the apple fell? The tree that had defied his gravity in the first place, rising skywards, majestically, towards the stars.” The headline on the article is I Have Seen the Light, but the editors could have saved themselves a few characters and just titled it, more accurately, Made Ya Think.Evans thrillingly reveals all the things he has learned with such aperçus as: “Everything you really want, you already have” (probably true of a man who owns one of the most expensive car collections in the country) and: “We say: ‘I am not myself today,’ but we never say: ‘Myself is not my I today.’” Made ya think!If you’re thinking: “Sounds like my man was given some Eckhart Tolle for Christmas,” you would not be far wrong. Tolle – the favoured writer for all narcissists – has indeed shaped what I guess we can call Evans’ “thinking”. But, true to form, Evans doesn’t just like Tolle – he worships him. He is, Evans says, in a line that is a million times funnier than anything that was in Zoolander 2, “my No 1 guru” Evans has read The Power of Now every year for the past two decades, a habit that has been scientifically proven (maybe) to have a more corrosive effect on the brain than long-term cocaine use. “Manifestation is the art of making what you want to happen happen. It is a real superpower available to us all,” Evans continues, and there, I’m afraid, I must manifest cutting him off.It is quite something how these guys all go the same way, isn’t it? They make too much money and then decide to show their humility by adhering to some kind of cod quasi-mysticalreligious theory that conveniently always puts them at its godlike centre. Kanye West has taken this to the extreme, with his VVVVIP invitation-only weekly gospel services, and poor old Tom Cruise took it further still, advocating the benefits of Scientology with a mad glint in his otherwise dead eyes. But Evans suggesting everyone can become a millionaire like him if they just read enough Tolle isn’t far off. What’s striking about Evans is that even the most coked-up British celebrities generally avoid this pitfall by clinging on to some vestiges of humour and self-awareness. Robbie Williams at his most nonsensical was always funny about his nonsense, while Noel Gallagher has made a whole post-Oasis career out of laughing at the whole shebang. Evans, however, can now be found in Sunday papers opining “‘I’ is everything.” Isn’t it just?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52463ecfee14434bcd49d3ee116eaee9ca82221d/0_611_1181_708/master/1181.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be75a562d98880b91bbe01a2acdf5eda 700w","title":"angela rayner launches campaign to become deputy labour leader","story":"Labour MP says she hates being pigeonholed as she joins deputy leadership race Angela Rayner has claimed she is neither a “Corbynite” nor in the mould of any other past Labour leader as she officially launched her campaign to become party deputy.The shadow education secretary said she would not be pigeonholed politically despite working closely with the Labour leader since she was elected to parliament in 2015 and being one of the most senior female figures in his team.Rayner is believed to be among the frontrunners to replace Tom Watson.She said: “I don’t consider myself to be of one political persuasion or another. I’m not a Blairite, I’m not a Corbynite, I’m not a Brownite. I’m an Angela Rayner – a member of the Labour party who has various different opinions on lots of different things just in the same way MPs and other party activists would.“I hate it when people try and pigeonhole me.”At her launch in a community centre on the estate where she grew up in Stockport, Greater Manchester, she said female politicians were often asked what kind of male politician’s style they might try to emulate.On whether the expected leadership candidate Rebecca Long Bailey – who is also her flatmate – is “continuity Corbyn”, Rayner said she “took offence on her behalf”. And she said: “One thing I know about Becky and you will know soon, if you don’t already, is she is her own woman.”Asked how she defined her own politics, Rayner said: “I am definitely a socialist and I’m proud to be one. I am actually proud that you can actually say that because I think at one time saying that you’re a socialist meant you were some sort of loony left which is a term that I don’t like.“In fact that was levelled at me during the general election by a Conservative MP, which I think is quite offensive to people in our movement.”Rayner said the party faced an existential challenge in the aftermath of the general election defeat. “As a party we face a choice. Win or die. And I fight to win,” she said.She said she accepted her share of the blame for Labour’s Brexit position that had confused both remainers and leavers, including members of her own family.“I have to accept responsibility. We all must have to accept some responsibility in the Labour party because we were ided as a party and ided parties do not win general elections.“Time and time again we had people saying they felt patronised. Members of my family were very angry with me and I couldn’t go to the pub or school gate without someone wanting to tell me about what they thought we were doing.” She said the party now had to draw a line in the sand.Speaking in the Bridge Hall estate in Stockport, where Rayner grew up and raised her son Ryan after giving birth as a teenager, she said was proud to return there to make her pitch.“I wanted the young girls in particular on this estate to know that they are me, and I am them, and that was so important to me that I came back here and acknowledged the role this estate has had on making me the person I am today,” she said.Rayner said she would vote for her flatmate, the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long Bailey, if she decided to run for leader, which she is expected to do in the coming days.The pair, who both had prominent roles under Corbyn, are expected to form an effective joint ticket to appeal to his supporters and those on the left of the party.“I will be quite straightforward: I will be voting for my friend Rebecca Long Bailey if she stands for the leadership,” she said.She explained why she was not standing for the position herself, saying: “I’ve been an organiser all my life and I consider some of my key skills of bringing that unity to our party and taking it forward. I can deal with problems that we face. I can deal with tough questions and I can face down anyone who thinks it’s OK to bully and abuse anyone in our party. I think I can do that as deputy leader.”“It is no secret for years me and Rebecca Long Bailey have been good friends and I wasn’t going to stand for leader and allow everyone in the media and everyone outside saying ‘who is the better woman?’.” She said the next five years would be “the fight of our lives” but one the entire Labour movement must tackle head-on. The cross-party support Rayner has gained at this early stage is being seen as a major advantage while other candidates are still ringing around seeking endorsements from colleagues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c87f83cee809dd4a060b523c99dbdd68d0380dc/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5a211ce8e17febb43698b675afe5d90","title":"dominic cummings not allowed to directly hire civil servants no 10","story":"PM’s chief adviser called for ‘weirdos and misfits’ to email him directly about jobsBoris Johnson’s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, will not be allowed to bypass Whitehall’s usual recruitment processes when recruiting “weirdos” and “misfits” for Downing Street jobs, No 10 has said. Cummings has been criticised by employment lawyers and unions after posting a rambling 2,900-word blogpost calling for people with “odd skills” to circumvent the usual rules in applying for jobs as special advisers and officials in government.“It’s important when dealing with large organisations to dart around at different levels, not be stuck with formal hierarchies. It will seem chaotic and ‘not proper No 10 process’ to some. But the point of this government is to do things differently and better,” he wrote.The prime minister’s spokesman insisted the post was aimed only at seeking “expressions of interest” and that civil servants would still be appointed within the usual tight procedures of the civil service.“What we are doing is equipping the government for the specific challenge of making sure that we absolutely deliver on the people’s priorities,” he said.“It is important to see what the blog is – it is seeking expressions of interest. Civil servants continue to be appointed in the usual way.“The government is committed to levelling up across every part of the United Kingdom and we will take whatever innovative steps are required to deliver that.”Lawyers raised alarm bells after Cummings called for 21-year-old recruits to apply for jobs that would not allow time for them to have a girlfriend or boyfriend, as well as claiming they could be sacked quickly if they did not “fit”.Cummings, who has said he wants to overhaul civil service recruitment, wrote that he wanted “true wild cards” to email him directly if they believed they were qualified to work as special advisers “and perhaps some as officials”.He called for applications from data scientists, software engineers, economists, policy experts, project managers, communication experts and junior researchers – one of whom to act as his personal assistant – who were “weirdos and misfits with odd skills”.In one section, Cummings wrote that he wanted to bring in “super-talented weirdos” with “genuine cognitive ersity” and avoid senior civil service applicants with Oxford and Cambridge English degrees.“We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole, weirdos from William Gibson novels like that girl hired by Bigend as a brand ‘iner’ who feels sick at the sight of Tommy Hilfiger or that Chinese-Cuban free runner from a crime family hired by the KGB.Sir David Normington, a former permanent secretary of both the Department for Education and the Home Office, told the Observer that Cummings would not be able to reform Whitehall without support from senior officials.“It is a big machine and one person can’t change it without lots of allies. You do need the machine,” he said.One of the UK’s top employment lawyers previously told the  that the post was “quite outrageous from an employment law perspective”.“I am surprised the cabinet secretary allowed this advert to go out,” said John Bowers QC, a leading employment barrister.Philip Landau, a specialist employment lawyer at Landau Law Solicitors, identified potential issues with Cummings’ mentions of the likely age of candidates. “It is not usually advisable to set out a specific age in an advertisement in case it can amount to discrimination. This is unless there is an occupational requirement to do so.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49127d4e6bdb6dc6a4447dc070880a7f001204fd/0_86_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=175c70995887b58d0c6e624488d301c2","title":"labour leadership election supporters 48 hours sign up","story":"New leader and deputy leader will be announced at special conference on 4 AprilLabour’s new leader and deputy leader will be announced at a special conference on 4 April, with prospective supporters given a 48-hour window next week to sign up if they want to have their say.The party’s ruling national executive committee (NEC) decided at a three-hour meeting on Monday that the framework for the contest would stick closely to that set out in the party’s rulebook.A Labour spokesperson said: “We are by far the largest political party in the UK with well over half a million members.

They will be debated this Wednesday.Senior government sources have warned of the “high hurdles” that the group faces to get its amendments through but the business groups say they will continue the fight in London, Dublin and Brussels to mitigate the profound impact Brexit will have locally.“In the best-case scenario, these amendments go through, and we have protected Northern Irish businesses and consumers.“In the worst-case scenario, we have raised and waved a very large flag in Dublin, London and Brussels that Northern Ireland ‘sorted’ is simply not true,” said Aodhán Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, one of the 12 groups behind the amendments.They are seeking legal guarantees for “unfettered” trade across the Irish Sea and future consultation with the devolved government over any new Brexit regulation affecting Northern Ireland.Their fourth amendment, which was not published over the weekend, calls for compensation.It states “no additional official or administrative costs consequent on any such regulations may be recouped from the private sector”.While no figure has been put on the cost, Connolly said the scale of it was clear.“Around the room on Friday it was very clear that for each of the industries the additional costs could run to tens of millions each,” he said, spelling out a potential cost of more than £100m across the board.The groups behind the amendments include the Ulster Farmers Union, the Confederation of British Industry, Manufacturing Northern Ireland, the Dairy Council and the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association.The government is unlikely to be defeated but Johnson could face political pressure as he promised unfettered trade during the election campaign.Johnson has promised that Northern Ireland businesses will face “no barriers of any kind”, even telling exporters during the election campaign that if they were asked to fill in any paperwork, they should telephone him directly and he would tell them to throw it in the bin.His remarks were challenged by the EU and by Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, who said it was “very clear” when the deal was done that there would have to be checks on goods coming from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.This is because under Johnson’s revised withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU customs code, which includes customs declarations and other formalities.Arlene Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, also accused Johnson of breaking a personal promise he had made to the party.Connolly said the business groups were trying to work with the government and not “bash” them over Brexit. It was “common sense” that a lorry carrying 1,000 different goods would face disruption, with as many as “800” of the goods facing sanitary and phyto-sanitary checks coming into Northern Ireland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc8689dd48f63bf19155c4c334c887b2e7b7618/0_120_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e342d7d8db8ae8bfff66103abadf3f9a","title":"our readers reveal how theyll have their last fling with the eu","story":"As our rights in Europe are set to be curtailed, Britons tell of plans on the continent from Interrail trips to learning GermanBritish citizens will no longer be EU citizens from 31 January if the withdrawal agreement Boris Johnson sealed in October is ratified.But Brexit day will not be the full stop on almost three decades in which British people, like their counterparts across the EU, had the freedom to travel, work and retire in any other member states visa-free.Those rights are scheduled to end on 31 December, when the transition period expires, freedom of movement ends and Britain leaves the single market.We asked readers what they would like to do in the last 11 months in which these benefits of EU membership apply.Plan: Take as many trees as I can to the DordogneAfter Brexit, I’ll almost certainly need a phytosanitary certificate for each species of tree. Completely unaffordable at my scale of operation. So I’ll take as many trees as I can, and from next year on I’ll have to change the way I work, to try to propagate my trees in France, which will be tricky, as I’m not there all the time.I might have to dig a large pond and grow my tree seedlings on rafts, hydroponically, so they’ll be protected from slugs, mice, deer, boar and rabbits. For some of the people I’ve got to know in the business, Brexit will be a disaster, as some of them sell the great majority of their plants to the EU.Unemployed and disabledPlan: Get an electric wheelchair in the EUI will continue my discrimination claim against the government body that I worked for, using the fair laws from the EU that cover workers’ rights before they are rewritten and possibly withdrawn by the Tories to exclude holiday pay or disability support.I’d love to visit some more EU countries, but as my NHS wheelchair provider has been privatised, I need to fund £6,000 for the electric wheelchair suggested by said provider before I can leave the house independently or at least with minimal support. Please note that research has shown there to be other options at much lower price points, but they have not been considered by the provider.I think I will also invest some of my time investigating the possibility of remaining an EU dual national by descent as my mum’s family are Irish immigrants, but it’s OK because she voted Tory as she says, “We have too many immigrants in this country.”I might also look for a new, less xenophobic family.I am living and still working with metastatic lung cancer. I cannot get affordable travel insurance. After we leave the UK I will be unable to visit Europe again, which is especially bad because I plan to retire next year.I am devastated that within a year’s time I’ll cease to be an EU citizen, but I intend to make the most of it. Once I graduate I plan to embark on a few weeks interrailing through most of northern and central Europe I’m going to visit cities across Germany, Austria, Hungary and Switzerland and develop my German language skills. Other than that, I’ll try to visit as many of my EU friends whom are dotted across Europe whilst it is still practical to do so.IT finance and riskPlan: Move to an EU state with accelerated route to citizenship for skilled workersI am going to move to one of the smaller EU27 countries that has an accelerated route to citizenship for highly qualified or skilled workers. Several of the eastern EU countries have this – Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, for example.I have enough in the bank to afford to support myself in such a move, to set up a start-up or work for a firm over there.Whichever country I settle in, I intend to have a sideline recruiting highly skilled finance \u0026amp IT workers who are also looking for a quick route to EU citizenship. I expect this brain drain to really accelerate in 2020 during the transition period. The UK will become a goldmine for talent for smaller EU countries.Make sure I obtain Irish citizenship and then a passport ASAP.I had an Irish grandmother who left the Republic because she didn’t fancy a life of drudgery on the family farm. She watched part of the 1916 Rising across the street from the GPO (General Post Office, centre of the battle) and got shot at.Most importantly, I’m going to spend the year telling my European friends and colleagues that I love them and that Scotland needs them to stay.I’ve always wanted the UK to stay together but that is over so I’ll be campaigning for Indyref2 and a Yes vote. Finally, I’ll be making a special effort to be kind to folks. This is so important at this time. P.s. I’d also like to take a train journey on to the continent in late Mayearly June. No more flying.Writer and activist for Syria UKMy first trip to Europe was in 1963 – my brother and I went with our parents to Austria by train and it was the most exciting thing. I’ve never looked back and will continue to visit Europe as long as my health allows it.I love this country but now it feels mean and I feel like I’m wandering in a wasteland.My partner and I are going off in our camper van in January, we aren’t sure where we are going but we are getting out of here for a while, probably down to Spain and Portugal.Later in the year I hope to visit my cousin in Italy – she is English but has been married to an Italian doctor and has lived in Italy for 35 years and she is very sad to see us leaving and I am heart-broken too.Become a German. Odd? Not really – I have come to know Germans quite well and know that they are very open and generous people who can not understand why the Brits have gone off the rails so radically. None here understands why people in the UK are so radically opposed to working with the “Continent”.Lucy (name changed for confidentiality)Stay at home mum, 43Plan: Get IVF again in the EU at the same price.I’ve been offered a job in Germany working in customer service for Microsoft. I had never intended to take up an office job (all my previous jobs have been in tourism and involved being active). However, my priority is now leaving Britain for good.I have been making the most of freedom of movement since the age of 18: I have Interrailed and travelled extensively, studied at a French university, worked in France as a tour guide, worked as a holiday representative in Spain, worked in a hostel in Budapest.I’m using my last year of freedom of movement, as a British citizen at least, to become a legal resident of Germany and then hopefully one day regain the rights I am about to loose due to Brexit.Thanks to Brexit, I won’t be able to easily keep doing the seasonal work I love doing, because the likelihood of receiving a work permit as a non EU national is slim to none. I think it’s a great shame because I have lived, worked and studied in three other countries already at the age of 21, all without hassle due to freedom of movement. Boris’ intentions for Britain scare me and I feel no option but to leave the UK to secure a better future for myself.Plan: Get Irish citizenship (even though I have no Irish family connection)I shall be applying for Irish citizenship so I can retain all my rights as a European that have been taken away without so much as a please by the nut Brexiteers.Having lived here for nearly 20 years, it shouldn’t be a problem but, as someone with no familial Irish connection, it’s going to cost over €4,000 for the four of us in my family.However, it will be well worth it not to have to be part of the dysfunctional UK. Showing a blue British passport as you queue with all the other non-Europeans would be the last straw. I shall have a small passport burning ceremony if I’m successful.Plan: move to FranceWe will sell our house and try to persuade the French to let us live there.Plan: considering a move to FranceI am seriously considering moving to live in France together with my wife to join our daughter and eldest son (and seven of our 10 grandchildren) – both of whom moved to France some 20 years ago. However, we have a dilemma – our youngest son and his wife with their three young children live close by to us in North Wales and it would be a tremendously difficult decision to make.I have lived and worked in mainland Europe all of my working life – in Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Italy. I was devastated and dismayed by the results of the general election and feel Brexit is the wrong thing to do – a big mistake – no one has ever given me any convincing argument or advantage for leaving the EU – no one ever will.Plan: Travel in EUPlan: tie the UK to EuropeBuy 100,000 kilometres of premium steel cable, 5m thick and tie Europe to our nation so as we never lose our close ties to Europe, as we are all Europeans.Acquire Dutch citizenship, at all costs. I have not lived in the UK since May 2003 and to have to return would be a personal tragedy. My life is here, I have no connection with the UK. I will never go to Britain of my own volition.Apart from this, we hope to start a collective of musicians and artists to challenge the destructive myths of our society. We live in a society whose dominant narratives, of human centrality on the Earth, social and technological progress, endless growth,the primacy of the inidual … these stories no longer have any basis in reality, and no longer equip us to deal with the political and ecological challenges of the new century.Thus, the next challenge, the most pertinent and urgent, must be to reinvent our cultural narratives to reflect our new situation. In the Netherlands we still have some hope that we can avoid our government being taken over by corporate-sponsored ethnic nationalists.To my fellow British-Europeans: I’m sorry for how things worked out for you. Don’t give up, but reevaluate, because a narrative which claims our current economic and political institutions can continue with minor progressive-oriented adjustments is no longer convincing, and will become less so as ecological and social disasters occur with ever greater frequency.Plan: get funding for an Erasmus period of study elsewhere in the EUI would like to pursue a postgraduate degree abroad, somewhere that is cheaper than in the UK. After three years of my undergraduate degree in Scotland, a place where an English-registered student still has to pay £9,000 a year, with classes bountiful with European students who pay less than I have for the same teaching and degree classification, I am looking for a bargain.Plan: move to another EU country, probably PortugalI’ve worked as an outdoor grower and harvest manager of an organic farm in Cornwall, I also team led Erasmus projects in Europe.I’m obviously very sad about the nation I can no longer be a part of I’m English in birth only.You may not be able to change the direction your country is moving in, but you can change your future. You don’t have to give up your rights, no one should be subjected to criminal abuse. Leave just as this nation has left its closest partners … it’s your life!Plan: looking forward to BrexitWe have three foreign daughters in law: one German, one Russian and one Australian with five grandchildren who have dual nationality so the outcome of the referendum has been looked at passionately over the past few years.We operate as a family within the need of a visa-required world and find it a little inconvenient but accept it for what it is: those countries’ rights to control their borders and refuse entry or pack off home anyone they see as a threat to their security or a threat to them from serious criminal activity, including one of the most liberal countries in the world, Australia!!!The biggest disaster to date was the introduction of the one size fits all euro, who says so? The very man whose idea it was in the first place, I wouldn’t argue with him as Im not qualified to do. He’s the professor of economics and recognised for it not me. I have carried out more reading on this one subject over the past four years than on any one single subject and therefore feel I take a balanced view. This whole circus pantomime played out right in front of our eyes and showed failings on all sides but was so intense it opened people’s eyes and I wasn’t surprised at the result of OUR general election.Plan: might move to NetherlandsI can’t stand to see the NHS fall apart under another Tory government, the stress of the job is too much even as a student and seeing my nursing colleagues struggle day after day unsafe staffing levels is too much.With leaving to Europe I need to get my skates on as my nursing degree may not be recognised and I will have to apply as a third country which involves a more complex, lengthy and expensive application process. Fingers crossed I can pass the Dutch language test and get on their nursing register before the Dec 2020 deadline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/872e03f001de5e1c9a25f71e2237124c6d4a6cf8/823_627_853_512/master/853.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cefaab2b863b848324cef4b4a8ecf9c9","title":"peaks parks and a beautiful beach city running in edinburgh","story":"From an extinct volcano to the 187 steps at Castle Wynd, there are plenty of highs for runners in Edinburgh – but if you want something less strenuous but equally stunning, try the beautiful beaches and picturesque parksEdinburgh oozes beauty from every pore and its dazzling architecture, stunning landmarks and lush green spaces make it a superb city to run around. I’m lucky enough to call Edinburgh home and the splendour of the city never ceases to amaze me.As daylight hours shorten, many runners would happily hang up their trainers for the winter but the rush of endorphins I get while running is the best thing to stave off seasonal sadness. When anxiety hits, I find the rhythmic pounding of my feet on the pavement and focusing on my breath calms my mind. The city is full of terrific running spots – from punishing peaks, to parks, to the gentle beauty of the beach. The only real difficulty you’ll have is deciding which one to tackle first.City centre sightseeingRunning is a brilliant way to see Edinburgh’s main historical landmarks and a jog through the city centre’s hilly streets really works up a sweat. For a pavement-heavy run, start at Waverley station and run west along the city’s main shopping thoroughfare past the famous Scott Monument, through the picturesque Princes Street Gardens, crunching through fallen leaves as you head towards Lothian Road. Swing left on to Kings Stables Road, then feel the gradient increase sharply at Johnston Terrace, marvelling as Edinburgh Castle looms above you.The brave can scale the 187 steps at Castle Wynd in a sprint to the castle esplanade, home to the annual military tattoo. After the uphill effort, I like to take a moment to catch my breath as I soak up the view of my beautiful birthplace, before running from the castle down the Royal Mile to the Palace of Holyroodhouse passing St Giles’ Cathedral this is a welcome downhill jog after the castle ascent.Holyrood Park and Arthur’s SeatAdjacent to the Palace of Holyroodhouse and the Scottish Parliament building is one of Edinburgh’s most famous landmarks – Arthur’s Seat. The extinct volcano dominates Edinburgh’s skyline and if you scale the peak, which sits 251m above sea level, you’ll be rewarded with panoramic views of the city and neighbouring Fife. Arthur’s Seat sits at the centre of Holyrood Park and the whole area holds a special place in my heart – it was the scene of my first ever 5K race and where I really caught the running bug.Portobello beachJust 3 miles (5km) from the city centre lies Portobello, a popular seaside destination for Edinburgh residents since the 19th century. I’ve been coming here since I was a child and find there’s nothing quite like the invigorating power of sea air to boost your mood and a beach run is the perfect antidote to the bustle of the city centre. A popular destination with runners, particularly following its inclusion in the Edinburgh Marathon route, the section of the promenade towards Musselburgh gives you the stunning view of the Firth of Forth on one side and elegant Georgian and Victorian architecture on the other. I usually choose to sprint along the smooth Victorian boardwalk but in colder weather find myself drawn to runs along the beach which glistens with frost in the winter, enjoying the sensation of sand moving underfoot. Once I work up an appetite, I visit one of the great selection of independent bars and cafes on the promenade for post-run refuelling.Water of Leith walkwayA combination of paved path and gravel track, this 12-mile (19km) walkway snakes through the city from the foot of the Pentland Hills to the port of Leith and is great for runners who enjoy off-road, traffic-free running, as I do. The route takes you through some of Edinburgh’s most attractive neighbourhoods and my favourite stretch of the path runs from the Shore in Leith to the Gallery of Modern Art via the Royal Botanic Gardens, swanky Stockbridge and the delightful Dean village. The area around the Dean village is particularly charming and features a fast-flowing, roaring current, tree-lined paths and bridges across the water.The running trail can sometimes get a bit muddy, so an all-terrain shoe is very much needed, and the waterway is home to lush vegetation, an abundance of wildlife and six life-size humanoid sculptures by award-winning artist Antony Gormley. As well as being a popular path for runners, you’ll also find the route frequented by friendly dog walkers, cyclists and even the occasional horse rider.Inverleith ParkJust to the north of the New Town and Stockbridge, you’ll find Inverleith Park – a sanctuary of green space in the heart of the capital and one of Scotland’s largest urban parks at 22 hectares (54 acres). Inverleith boasts a wonderful view of Edinburgh Castle and is a favourite spot for locals to assemble to watch the various firework displays that take place towards the end of the year.I love Inverleith because it’s a park that’s got something for everyone, including sports pitches, allotments, a pond and a children’s play area. The tree-lined park splits into four near equal parts by a combination of concrete path and muddy trail – and my favourite running routes takes the form of a figure of eight circuit of the grounds. I always make a point of visiting the recently installed wet garden, which includes a range of plant species that will help reduce blue-green algae in the water. A wooden boardwalk provides access to the area to view the flora and fauna that now inhabit the pond."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0894365c20dafe5439a530ad704a8f52db73d0e8/0_234_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a6b354b5faf1ddac05b74e68488e38","title":"nobel prize winner demonstrates best way apologize chemist frances arnold","story":"Unfortunately there aren’t Nobel prizes for good apologies – but Dr Frances Arnold’s words should be an example to all of usA Nobel prize winner has issued a humble apology when a recent paper of hers was retracted.In a remarkable display of humility, Dr Frances Arnold, who won the Nobel prize in chemistry in 2018, came forward herself to let her followers know that a 2019 paper of hers had been retracted.“For my first work-related tweet of 2020, I am totally bummed to announce that we have retracted last year’s paper on enzymatic synthesis of beta-lactams,” she began, before accepting responsibility.In doing so, Arnold has mastered the art of a good apology: one that doesn’t veer into excusing oneself that gives context where relevant but accepts full responsibility and moves on.In return,she has been thanked for her honesty.Dr Betül Kacar, an astrobiologist from the University of Arizona, tweeted: “This is the hardest thing, and what a true scientist does. Thank you for setting the record straight.”Jonathan P Dowling, an academic from Louisiana State University, replied: “You did the right thing! All we scientists are human. What makes us scientists is our means to find our mistakes.”Arnold, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, shared the Nobel prize for chemistry in 2018, alongside researchers from Harvard and Cambridge.At the time, spokespeople for the prize said her work was “inspired by the power of evolution and used the same principles – genetic change and selection – to develop proteins that solve mankind’s chemical problems”.The retracted paper was published later, in the journal Science in May 2019. Science published an official statement in which it said the results from the paper were not reproducible, and that there was missing data found in a lab notebook. There has been no indication that the oversight was down to deliberate scientific misconduct.Unfortunately there aren’t Nobel prizes for good apologies. But Arnold’s response should be an example to all of us in 2020: when wrong, admit your mistake, apologise and promise to do better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9804da916c20b3a0facdf4eb2f66e61cfa429b93/0_91_3270_1963/master/3270.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18e4cbdf2474aa684d0f0f1da1fa056b","title":"dallas cowboys set to appoint former packers head coach mike mccarthy","story":"Mike McCarthy is set to take up arguably the highest-profile coaching position in US sports, with multiple sources indicating he is the new head coach of the Dallas Cowboys.Fox Sports, ESPN and the Associated Press reported on Monday that McCarthy will replace Jason Garrett, who the Cowboys fired on Sunday. The Cowboys finished this season with an 8-8 record and missed the playoffs despite competing in the weak NFC East. Garrett won only two playoff games during his nine seasons in charge, a disappointment at a team Forbes values at $5bn, making the Cowboys the most valuable sports franchise in the world.McCarthy’s success in the playoffs may have clinched him the job with the Cowboys. He made the playoffs in nine of his 13 seasons with the Green Bay Packers, and won the Super Bowl in February 2011. He did, however, benefit from having one of the best players in the game, Aaron Rodgers, as his quarterback. Some believe McCarthy should have had more success with Rodgers at his disposal, and he failed to lead Green Bay to the postseason in his final two years with the Packers. Supporters of McCarthy said he helped Rodgers become one of the greatest quarterbacks in history, and the Cowboys may see him as a mentor to their own franchise quarterback, Dak Prescott.McCarthy has been out of a job since parting ways with the Packers midway through last season.

She added that some girls in Thailand started doping when they were as young as 13 to prepare for national competitions.The IOC told the  that it had set up a disciplinary investigation “to immediately follow up on the doping confession of Gulnoi and her entourage”.The programme, made by the same investigators who unearthed the Russian doping scandal in 2014, also alleged that some weightlifters secretly paid testers in exchange for “clean” tests.Investigators secretly recorded a conversation with Dorin Balmus, a doctor with the Moldova weightlifting team, who said “doppelgangers” gave urine samples in place of athletes in exchange for a payment to testers from the Hungary National Anti-Doping Agency, who carried out the majority of the 16,000 tests in international weightlifting in the 10-year period up to 2018.Weightlifting has had doping issues for decades but the issue has become so widespread that the IOC has previously threatened to withdraw its Olympic status. It refused to be drawn on whether the latest allegations would affect weightlifting’s place in Tokyo, but in a statement it said: “The accusations are very serious and worrying. The IOC will contact Wada in order to keep anyone involved in the alleged infringements of the World Anti-Doping Code away from the Olympic Games.”ARD also cited documents allegedly showing that at least £4.2m in funding from the IOC to the International Weightlifting Federation was transferred into two Swiss accounts of which only the IWF president, Tamas Ajan, had oversight.However the IWF insisted that its executive board had “discussed and dealt with” accusations that Ajan had mishandled Olympic Games TV revenue shares between 2009 and 2011 and had subsequently submitted a “document package” to the IOC Ethics Commission for study.“It was finally established that no money was missing,” it said in a statement, “and all the Olympic revenues were accounted and duly documented in the IWF official bank accounts (none of them secret).”The IWF added that while it took the ARD allegations seriously, the programme contained other mistakes. “The IWF is particularly concerned by the revelations concerning what may have been the systematic doping of junior athletes,” it said.“Amid a number of apparent falsehoods, unsubstantiated allegations and disproven rumours dating back to as far as 2008, there does seem to be some fresh information which may be of use to the IWF’s efforts to promote clean weightlifting and protect clean sport.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6c9601762d59717373a914eab323a38414b5a1e/0_159_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=07da55d8405b5cb9a2f6e702464bed00","title":"ben stokes south africa england second test","story":"Ben Stokes missed the start of this tour to make sure he could pick up the BBC’s Sports Personality of the Year award in person after a stellar 2019. Six days into 2020 the all-rounder looks as if he is in the mood to hang on to that crown for another year.Following a record-equalling five catches in South Africa’s first innings, Stokes pulverised the home bowlers during a remarkable 75-minute cameo in which 72 runs flowed from his bat off 47 balls. Those who remark that this form of the game is boring or that it needs to be altered should have been at Newlands as, powered largely by Stokes’s brutal assault, England piled up 157 runs in a session comprising only 27 overs.Forget the Hundred, this was sporting entertainment at its very best as Stokes put his foot to the floor, hammering seven fours and three sixes, to extend England’s lead well beyond 400. It was cricket on fast forward and there was no need for fireworks, cheerleaders or player drafts to jazz up the “product”.Dominic Sibley’s grind on Sunday had set up this scenario for Stokes, who started the day on nought following the dismissal of the nightwatchman Dom Bess to the final ball of the previous evening. Sibley resumed on 85 but at one point, with Stokes reaching his half‑century in 34 balls and in exactly 50 minutes, it appeared as if he would be beaten to the century mark by his batting partner even though he was on 95 at the time.Whatever it is about this ground, Stokes certainly likes it. Four years ago he hit the quickest Test double hundred by an England player – in 163 balls – and the second fastest by anyone when he bludgeoned 258. England drew that match on a flat pitch, yet the speed of Stokes’s scoring on this fourth morning may prove crucial in the final reckoning of this contest that Joe Root’s team will believe they can still win on the final day despite South Africa’s stubborn resistance.What was so impressive about this particular contribution was how selfless it was. On 72 and with the landmark of a Test century in sight, many players would dial down the risk-reward ratio in terms of their shots. But not Stokes, England’s vice-captain, whose leadership position within this group was officially restored last summer following the incident in Bristol that led to him being stripped of the role in 2017.By the time he holed out to the spin of Keshav Maharaj Stokes had a strike-rate of 153.19. Only two other England players have higher for a Test innings of 50 or more – Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff.There was one moment of danger during this latest Stokes masterpiece, when he was dropped on 38 off Kagiso Rabada. But it was the 28-year-old’s most fluent batting display since that epic unbeaten 135 that almost singlehandedly helped England to chase down 359 against Australia at Headingley last summer. That, and his heroics in the World Cup final – where Stokes’s bat again proved the difference in an altogether different classic against New Zealand at Lord’s – meant he deservedly topped the vote for the the BBC award last month.The early signs this year are that this is a man determined to continue defining contests with his sheer force of will. Over the weekend his five catches in South Africa’s first innings equalled the most by a fielder in Tests as he became the 12th player – not including wicketkeepers – to achieve the feat. This latest contribution with the bat, though, surpassed that and England might need him to conjure up something special with the ball on the final day at Newlands as they hunt for a series‑levelling victory.However this series ends up, Stokes will again be his country’s key man across all formats this year. The England and Wales Cricket Board will hope he sprinkles some much-needed stardust on their new 100-ball competition when that starts in July. But for Stokes, a man who seemingly always rises to the big occasion, there is another global event he has the opportunity to dominate – the T20 World Cup in Australia this autumn. It is a trophy England would have won in India four years ago had Stokes not conceded four successive sixes to Carlos Brathwaite in the final over of the tournament in Kolkata.This year, then, offers a chance of redemption for Stokes in that particular format. If his 2020 continues like this, do not count against him correcting that blot on his career and inspiring England to another memorable victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18765628b128ad6380319ae8c88527dbbdb176fa/126_119_3438_2063/master/3438.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=866c99e588c3a6b8dc91a03be14bd5fc","title":"south africa v england second test day four live","story":"Dom Sibley made his maiden Test hundred and Ben Stokes smashed 72 from 47 balls, but England still need eight wickets on the final day to square the seriesThanks for your company and emails. I’ll leave you with Vic’s report from Cape Town. Please join Simon and Tim tomorrow morning for the final day’s play it’ll be worth it.Close of play England need eight wickets for victory tomorrow, South Africa 312 runs. We can probably discount the latter, Quinton de Kock notwithstanding, but the home side have a decent chance of batting out a draw. Their key men are the debutant Pieter Malan, who has already survived 193 balls for his 63, and the captain Faf du Plessis. England will take encouragement from the hint of reverse swing that Jimmy Anderson found late in the day to set up and then dismiss Zubayr Hamza. That could prove decisive, especially with the pitch offering little to the seamers or spinners.56th over: South Africa 126-2 (Malan 63, Maharaj 2) England give Malan a single off Curran’s first delivery, an unusual tactic that allows them to bowl at Maharaj. He is beaten, chasing a wide yorker, but there are no other alarms and he will return tomorrow morning. That’s stumps.55th over: South Africa 123-2 (Malan 62, Maharaj 0) Anderson almost gets another one, with the nightwatchman Maharaj beaten all ends up. I thought it was the last over of the day. In fact it was Anderson’s last over, and there will be one more at the other end.Anderson has always been so good at finding a way to take a wicket late in the day, and he’s done it again at the age of 37. Having set Hamza up with a few reverse inswingers, he got one to straighten just enough to take a thin edge as Hamza pushed forward defensively to cover any inswing. Jos Buttler did the rest, tumbling to his right to take a good two-handed catch. That is just brilliant from Anderson.Anderson has done it in the last over of the day!54th over: South Africa 123-1 (Malan 62, Hamza 18) Sam Curran replaces Ben Stokes for the last over at this end. Nothing happens. Pieter Malan has played an almost flawless defensive innings.“Hi Rob, Happy New Year,” says Robert Ellson. “I do hope the ICC’s cricket committee have enjoyed the first four days of this very compelling match.”53rd over: South Africa 122-1 (Malan 62, Hamza 17) With three overs remaining today, Jimmy Anderson replaces Joe Root. He has always prided himself of taking vital wickets at the end of long days, especially on flat tracks. Another here, especially that of Malan, would be precious. There is some reverse swing back into Malan, who offers no stroke to the first two deliveries. The second was pretty close, though I’m loath to call it a dodgy leave given how good Malan has been outside off stump. A maiden.52nd over: South Africa 122-1 (Malan 62, Hamza 17) Stokes to Hamza, round seven. Hamza does the sensible thing by pushing the ball to mid-on and getting the hell down the other end. A single from Malan brings up the second fifty partnership of the innings - this time with only one boundary. South Africa have managed risk superbly. Hamza survives the remainder of the Stokes (working-)over. Well played.“From memory, Mark Waugh spent much of his time at first slip, especially once Mark Taylor retired (from where he famously tried to sledge Jimmy Ormond),” says Richard O’Hagan. “Freddie, on the other hand, had to wait to even migrate to second slip. For much of his early career the first two spots were occupied by Trescothick and Strauss. Botham, on the other hand, was an almost immediate shoo-in for the number two slot. Although his ‘hands on knees’ technique provoked criticism, a few seasons of snaffling edges off Joel Garner had already turned him into a fine slipper by the time he reached the England side. He also benefitted from a era where quick bowlers were expected to stand there - both Willis and Hendrick did so for England - rather than at fine leg.”Wasn’t it Warne 1, Mark Waugh 2? Oh I don’t know, it was forever ago.51st over: South Africa 119-1 (Malan 61, Hamza 16) Malan moves into the sixties with a pleasant drive for two off Root. Kevin Pietersen, commentating on Sky Sports, is full of praise for Malan’s temperament and technique. He’s not the only one, but his view is worth more than most. From the wreckage of 2019, South Africa have found some really promising newcomers.50th over: South Africa 117-1 (Malan 59, Hamza 16) England are giving Malan the single so that Stokes can bowl to Hamza. Nasser Hussain did that once to get an out-of-form Steve Waugh on strike during the 2002-03 Ashes imagine the four-letter comedy of Waugh’s internal monologue at that precise moment. Actually, you don’t have to, I’ve found it in Waugh’s book:It was Under-10 stuff by Nasser, intended to take the piss out of me and let his quick bowler have his way with me.The tension was stimulating and I wanted confrontation, but I needed to let off some steam.‘You smart-arse prick!’ seemed to cover that objective pretty well. To me, it was about respect.Back in 2019-20, Malan does take a single, allowing Stokes four balls at Hamza. The second of those is a jaffa that that roars past the edge. This is some hot, hot heat from Stokes, but Hamza is hanging in there.49th over: South Africa 116-1 (Malan 58, Hamza 16) Joe Root replaces Dom Bess, starting around the wicket to Malan. He plays a rare loose stroke, mistiming a sweep and gloving the ball over the head of Stokes at leg slip. England have tried everything today. We certainly can’t criticise them for not thinking outside the box.“Just how flipping King of the Valley have you just made me feel?” says Damian Clarke. “Skipper always used to put me at second slip, even though my ego said Please, Boss, Cover! Can’t wait for my wife to get home. She’ll be absolutely thrilled at my planned evening’s monologue.”48th over: South Africa 113-1 (Malan 55, Hamza 16) Hamza, reaching outside off stump at a short ball, clunks Stokes this far short of Broad at extra cover. He then flaps a bouncer unconvincingly into the leg side before being hit on the armpit as he tries to jump inside the line. Although Stokes is now bowling over the wicket, I think he was given an official warning for running on the pitch earlier in the over. That aside, it’s been a brilliant spell from Stokes.“Siamese Dream by the Smashing Pumpkins is not the best album ever,” says Matt Dony. “But it makes me feel things. Fernando Torres is not the greatest player to play for Liverpool. But I got unbelievably excited when the ball was at his feet. Matthew Arnold is not history’s greatest poet. But ‘Dover Beach’ has a final stanza that I find incredibly moving. Ben Stokes is not the greatest English all-rounder. But he brings something viscerally exciting to the table.”And it’s a lot more viscerally exciting than the phrase ‘viscerally exciting’.47th over: South Africa 113-1 (Malan 55, Hamza 16) Five from Bess’s over. I think it’s a mistake to persist with him tonight, and I’ll keep banging on about it until fate decides to shut me up.“I just meant the teams they’ve been in haven’t actually been tremendously successful (compared to the best teams of their time)!” says David Murray. “So can they really be such great matchwinners? PS England could still lose this...”I think they can, but each his own. I wouldn’t worry about England losing this unless de Kock takes matters into his own hands. South Africa won’t risk it.46th over: South Africa 108-1 (Malan 52, Hamza 14) Stokes winces after bowling one short ball to Malan. I think it’s his side, though he has no problem finishing the over. Another maiden to the hugely impressive Malan. Stokes looks absolutely shattered, so I fully expect him to bowl the remaining four overs at this end.“Enjoyed the discussion on our all-rounders,” says Paul in Manchester. “Just wondered why are they all brilliant at second slip? Rather than say in the covers? Or rather than first slip?”Stokes would be good anywhere, Flintoff and latterday Botham less so I suspect. The slip question is a good one. I assume it’s just that second slip is the most important position – Mark Waugh, probably the greatest of all, fielded there I think – and that they would have been equally good at first.45th over: South Africa 108-1 (Malan 52, Hamza 14) Bess has now moved around the wicket to the right-handers, which theoretically brings both edges into play, but in truth he is struggling to threaten either.“England have used seven bowlers before any one of the has bowled 10 overs,” says Michael Duggan. “Has this happened before in a Test? I wouldn’t even know how to begin asking Statsguru.”I suspect even Travis Basevi, the hulking genius who invented Statsguru, wouldn’t know how to ask that. I suspect it’s happened a few times in the past - perhaps in this match - but couldn’t be sure. 44th over: South Africa 106-1 (Malan 51, Hamza 13) Stokes has decided it’s time for some rough stuff from round the wicket. Rough is the operative word, as it might also be with a view to leaving a few footmarks outside the right-hander’s off stump for Dom Bess. Kumar Dharmasena has a word about his follow through halfway the over, in fact, so Stokes moves over the wicket for the final delivery. A maiden to Malan, who dealt with the short stuff comfortably.43rd over: South Africa 106-1 (Malan 51, Hamza 13) Malan drives Bess for a single to reach a very impressive half-century on debut. It’s been a calm, accomplished innings: 144 balls, two fours, umpteen well-judged singles. I think England should bring back Anderson at this end, as nothing much is happening for Bess. Do you hear that, fate? Can you hear me now? Nothing is happening for Bess. Sweet bugger all. D squat. Nuttin.42nd over: South Africa 103-1 (Malan 49, Hamza 12) A lovely delivery from Stokes follows Malan and hits him near the breastbone. It would be such a cliche if Stokes ripped out a couple of wickets before the close. There are 13 overs remaining.“Seems clear to me that Stokes is the best batsman, Flintoff the best bowler, Stokes the best fielder and Flintoff the most X-factor, which can only mean that England’s greatest allrounder is Botham,” says James. “Anyway, statistics show that Alastair Cook has a Test average of 47 with the bat and 7 with the ball.”And the best Bob Willis impersonation, so he wins in the crowd-pleasing department as well.41st over: South Africa 100-1 (Malan 46, Hamza 12) Bess gets one to kick at Hamza, who lets it go past his body and down the leg side for four byes. A bit more encouragement for England, though. That’s drinks.40th over: South Africa 96-1 (Malan 46, Hamza 12) Ben Stokes comes into the attack. He has a bowling average of 33.38, higher than those of Mark Ealham, Dermot Reeve and Richard Illingworth. He starts with a no-ball before hitting a good length with a bit of lift to Malan. As throughout the innings, Malan shows immaculate judgement outside off stump.39th over: South Africa 95-1 (Malan 46, Hamza 12) It’s not compulsory for England to bowl a spinner at the Kelvin Grove End, but that’s what Joe Root has done since Bess came into the attack. There isn’t much happening for him - a bit of turn, but not much bounce. South Africa must be starting to fancy their chances of drawing this match.38th over: South Africa 90-1 (Malan 44, Hamza 9) Broad turns Malan round with a good delivery that takes a leading edge and dribbles into the off side. England really need at least one more wicket tonight, and I’m surprised we haven’t seen Ben Stokes yet.“Pulling off miracles every now and then is fine,” says OB Jato, “but I think we can all agree that Colin de Grandhomme is the daddy of Test all-rounders?”Don’t. I still wake up most mornings in a cold sweat, eight overs into his spell in the World Cup final, the walls inexorably closing in.37th over: South Africa 89-1 (Malan 43, Hamza 9) Enough with the emails for a bit, I keep missing the actual cricket. The impressive Malan skids back in his crease to force consecutive deliveries from Bess for two and then three. He’s an alert runner, Malan, and his hit only two boundaries in his 43.36th over: South Africa 83-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 8) “Flintoff is a bit like Harmison,” says Stephen Wolstencroft. “When he was on it he was a world beater, but there were too many series when he was nowhere near his best andor drunk at sea. Stokes is more consistent, a better batsman, and has a habit of taking key wickets and of bowling Flintoff-like endurance spells. Freddie is better at chess, though.”Not sure I agree with that. As a batsman, certainly, but as a bowler I thought Flintoff was consistently excellent from around 2004 until his knee packed in, and even then he produced that epic spell in the 2009 Lord’s Test against Australia. Flintoff’s C-game was miles better than Harmison’s, in my humble one. Stokes is a much better batsman, though, even though Freddie did have a golden period from 2003-06. I’d say Stokes is closer to Botham, who was also technically excellent, as a batsman.35th over: South Africa 83-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 8) Dom Bess replaces Joe Denly, who did his job by getting rid of Dean Elgar. I’m still not convinced Elgar hit it, but hey ho. There’s a suggestion of turn to Hamza, who inside-edges one delivery onto the pad and short of the man at short leg. An accurate start from Bess.34th over: South Africa 83-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 7) Broad goes wide on the crease to Hamza, who edges along the ground for four. England only have two slips anyway and that was well wide of them. It’s hard yakka out there. England have 21 overs to take another wicket or two.“Re. your 30th over comments,” says David Murray. “Doesn’t this slightly ignore the fact that Stokes, Flintoff and even Botham perhaps didn’t actually win all that many matches compared with the very best?”That depends how you define matchwinning, I suppose. Jason Roy and Jos Buttler won the Headingley Test of 2019, but they scored 23 runs between them. 33rd over: South Africa 78-1 (Malan 38, Hamza 3) Hamza gets off the mark with a confident cut off Denly. He looks much less threatening to the right-handers from over the wicket than he did to Elgar. It might be worth trying to attack from round the wicket.“Look at what Stokes did today to set up a match-winning scenario,” says David Kelsey. “He came out and (elegantly) clumped 72 off 47. He could have done things very differently but he played the scenario for the team and he does this all the time. Averages are useful, context is usefullerererererer.”Yes but context, like lunch, is difficult. That’s why most people treat averages as gospel. Anyway, Stokes and Kallis are so different that there’s no point trying to compare them. It’s like comparing an epochal orgasm and a massive bank balance. 32nd over: South Africa 73-1 (Malan 36, Hamza 0) Stuart Broad replaces Sam Curran (6-2-9-0). That’s a bespoke bowling change, as Broad has dismissed Zubayr Hamza in every innings in this series. Hamza looks keen to get off strike, but does the next best thing by surviving the last four balls of the over.“The running down the wicket in the Oz match was innocuous in the extreme,” says Martin Turnbull. “Can you let David Murray know that his accusation will be remembered come the next Ashes. Looking forward to seeing the Poms put to the sword next year: 4-1 is my early prediction.”What makes you so confident England will win the fifth Test?31st over: South Africa 73-1 (Malan 36, Hamza 0) Denly continues, although he’s now bowling to two right-handers. He’d prefer to bowl to a left-hander, though none are due in until Quinton de Kock.30th over: South Africa 72-1 (Malan 35, Hamza 0) “Is it just me or is ‘XX can’t be judged by statistics’ standard English cricket fan speak for ‘not actually that great’?” says Indy Bagral. “You all love to harp on about single standout performances, but part of what makes such performances stand out is the dross that surrounds them. Stokes’ 4th innings at Headingley will live on in folklore but it politely ignores the fact that if he hadn’t got himself out chasing a wide one at 30 odd for 3 in the first innings, maybe some Hollywood heroics wouldn’t have been necessary in the first place? It’s always been a personal conviction of mine that this English preference for a highlights reel over boringly consistent actual brilliance is what keeps them from ever being the best for any sustained period of time.”I know what you mean, but I don’t particularly agree. I don’t have time to reply, properly, but I’ll always believe there is a small group of selfless matchwinners (Adam Gilchrist was another) whose impact cannot be conveyed through averages.29th over: South Africa 71-1 (Malan 34, Hamza 0) That was Joe Denly’s first Test wicket.Elgar pushed tentatively outside off stump at Denly and was given out caught behind. He reviewed straight away, thinking his bat had hit the ground. There was the smallest spike on UltraEdge as the ball went past the edge, and then another spike as the bat hit the ground. That was enough for the third umpire to uphold the original decision. My instinct is that Elgar didn’t hit it, but I suppose there wasn’t enough evidence for the third umpire to overrule.Joe Denly has struck! It’s a pretty controversial dismissal, which was upheld on review, but Elgar has gone.28th over: South Africa 64-0 (Malan 29, Elgar 32) This is good stuff from Curran, who is using plenty of variations in an attempt to make something happen. If Anderson and Broad are the classical interrogators, then Curran is more like Manny from Black Books. That over, a maiden to Elgar, was the fifth of his spell. He might have one more before Ben Stokes, who is a different kind of cop, replaces him at this end.26th over: South Africa 61-0 (Malan 28, Elgar 30) Curran switches over the wicket to Malan, who edges a good delivery along the floor to second slip. “Hi Rob,” says David Murray. “Interesting to read about Warner and Labuschagne both getting penalised for running down the pitch (presumably trying to make things easier for Lyon in the fourth innings). Australia still not averse to a bit of cheating?”I haven’t seen it, but I’d be surprised if it was deliberate. It doesn’t make much sense, as they were going to win anyway and we’re still in the PR years.25th over: South Africa 60-0 (Malan 28, Elgar 29) “Happy new year Rob, and to all those who read the OBO,” says Chris Drew. “Talking of the leg spin bowling of Marnŵs fach for Australia, he was also the second highest wicket taker for Glamorgan last season. I’m trying to contain my excitement for the new season...”He won’t just trouble the scorers, he’ll have them begging for mercy. 24th over: South Africa 57-0 (Malan 27, Elgar 27) Sam Curran continues at the other end, the one with the crack. Malan takes a sharp single to mid-off, a reflection of South Africa’s positive intent since tea. They’ve scored 10 in two overs, all in ones and twos.23rd over: South Africa 52-0 (Malan 24, Elgar 26) There are 33 overs to bowl this evening. England probably need at least two wickets in that time to ensure a decent night’s sleep. The part-time legspinner Joe Denly, who looked dangerous before tea, has Elgar in trouble straight away. His third ball spat from the rough to hit Elgar on the arm guard and loop wide of Buttler. England thought it was a chance, with Buttler stretching desperately in an unsuccessful attempt to take the catch, but replays showed it wouldn’t have been out. Later in the over Malan pushed a single to bring up a solid fifty partnership. “Stokes v Flintoff?” says Tom Carver. “Children of their times and can’t be compared. Stokes is a millennial striving to be the best version of himself. Flintoff was a naughty noughties boozer mainly striving to have fun and play some cricket along the way. Stokes is the better player, applies himself more assiduously and will end up with better stats, but Flintoff will be remembered more fondly.”Depends whether you’re X or Y, surely?Tea South Africa have a chance of saving this match. England are still strong favourites, with four sessions remaining, but the pitch isn’t doing a lot and South Africa know their way round a fourth-innings rearguard. See you in 15 minutes for the final session.22nd over: South Africa 46-0 (Malan 23, Elgar 21) Joe Root brings himself on for the latest before tea. A lot goes on but nothing happens, and South Africa go to tea unscathed. Pieter Malan and Dean Elgar have played impressively.21st over: South Africa 44-0 (Malan 22, Elgar 20) Denly enquires politely for LBW when Malan pushes forward with bat and pad together. Even if it was pad first, he was outside off stump. Another encouraging over from Denly, who will hopefully continue after tea.“The StokesFlintoff debate is getting a tad tedious,” says Nacmac Bok. “The definitive answer to an allrounder debate is always Jacques Kallis.”Even when the question is about English allrounders?20th over: South Africa 43-0 (Malan 21, Elgar 20) Curran continues around the wicket to Malan. He leaves everything outside off stump, including a couple of deliveries that lift from a length. His judgement looks excellent.19th over: South Africa 41-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 20) Another imaginative bit of captaincy from Joe Root, who has brought on Joe Denly to replace Dom Bess. There’s a lot of rough outside the left-hander’s off stump, and we saw how dangerous the part-time legspin of Marcus Labuschagne could be during the Ashes.Malan overbalances and is fortunate that the ball hits the pad and deflects wide of Buttler for a leg bye. Had it done so, that would have been a stumping chance. The next ball bursts from the rough to Elgar, who gloves it in the air on the off side. The delivery after that rips through the gate to hit Elgar in the chest, and he ends the over by missing a slightly flustered sweep stroke. A superb, mood-changing first over from Denly.18th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 19) Sam Curran comes on to replace Jimmy Anderson. I think he’ll be an important bowler today, with his variety, intelligence and golden arm. He goes straight around the wicket to the right-handed Malan, who offers no stroke to a ball that curves reasonably close to off stump. Another maiden, the fourth in five overs.“Interesting debate about the best all-rounder,” says Max in Germany, “but I think Stokes has the talent (and time) to be even more devastating than Kallis.”What Stokes doesn’t have, and probably never will, are Kallis’s ruthlessness and concentration. That’s why his career averages will be nowhere near as good. But you can’t really judge Stokes by statistics. It’s like trying to quantify love, or something.17th over: South Africa 39-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 19) Apologies, I’m all over the show here. To be honest, very little is happening. South Africa are plodding along comfortably, England are getting no help from the pitch or the Kookaburra ball. 16th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Malan does well to shoulder arms and allow a lifter from Anderson to whistle past his armpit. He looks an accomplished old-fashioned opener, an observation supported by his first-class record: 10,000 runs at an average of 45.“Re: Faf’s debut rearguard hundred... look at AB’s scoring rate in the second innings!” says Kevin Wilson. “For a guy with a reputation as a 360 degree player made for T20, he could bat out time when his side was under the cosh phenomenally well. Check this out against India in 2015. South Africa lost, but they batted 143 overs for 143 all out! De Villiers scored 43 from 297 balls!” That team was great at putting the shutters up. The thing I love most about de Villiers’ rearguard in Adelaide is that, six days later, he lashed 169 from 184 balls to win the series. Where do you even start with that level of brilliance? Headingley 2019, I suppose.15th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Another economical over from Bess. He’s not really threatening, though, and I’d like to see Sam Curran have a few overs from that end. 14th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 20, Elgar 17) Sorry, I keep missing the actual cricket to attend to emails. The lack of excitement in the TV commentary suggests you’re not missing much.“I’d agree re Freddie being a better bowler,” says Boris Starling. “You rarely get the sense that Stokes is capable of turning a game with the ball the way he is with the bat, or that he could bowl an over like Flintoff’s famous one at Edgbaston to get rid of Langer and Ponting in 2005. When it comes to discussing all-round play, we shouldn’t forget Stokes’ fielding, which is as good as anyone in the world right now and as any England player in history. If it came to picking one man to take a catch for my life, I’d probably still have Mark Waugh, but Stokes would definitely be in the mix.”Flintoff was an immense bowler. At his best, he was the most irresistible England bowler of my cricket-watching lifetime. Others did it for much longer, I realise.13th over: South Africa 37-0 (Malan 19, Elgar 17) Bess has a slip and short leg for Malan, who looks comfortable in coming down the track to the offspinner. Three from the over. No sign of any bite for Bess at the moment.“Based on this morning’s evidence, we might be forgiven for thinking that Stokes cares more about England winning this match than nurturing his career average,” says Brian Withington. “The man clearly has no future in the game - let’s make him captain soon.”He’d be a shoo-in for an all-time Selfless XI. One of the best things about this morning’s innings is that Stokes took two - one for the team one for Dom Sibley. In a parallel universe Stokes batted at a normal tempo, Sibley worried that he was holding the team back and got himself out for 93.12th over: South Africa 34-0 (Malan 17, Elgar 17) Anderson changes ends to replace Broad (5-1-13-0), and Malan drives him crisply through extra cover for three. He’s playing nicely. As is Elgar, who pings a boundary through mid-on off the next delivery. This is a test of England’s patience.“I’d be quite up for a rearguard action here,” says Pete Salmon. “Remember those? Mark Greatbatch or Andy Flower batting for seven sessions, jumpers for goalposts. Nowadays it’s all Ben Stokes and Kusal Perera sort of nonsense. Be nice to be applauding Elgar off at the end of the match on 158 not out in a total of 8360. Proper cricket.”If anyone can, South Africa can. Faf du Plessis famously did it on debut, and that great side of the early 2010s had a few such rearguards. That said, those who really know their Onions would rather South Africa ended nine rather than eight wickets down.11th over: South Africa 27-0 (Malan 14, Elgar 13) Malan uses his feet to drive Bess for a single, something South Africa didn’t really do in the first innings. That’s drinks, which comes at a decent time for England’s thinktank.“Not sure why commentators are in a funk about letting Broad have a few overs out in the middle,” says Tom Atkins. “There’s plenty of time, he could use the practice out in the middle and for me the psychological value of making bowlers toil pointlessly and the openers sweat out on the field shouldn’t be underestimated.”Most people are disproportionately angry about something these days. And if you don’t agree, I’ll fill you in.10th over: South Africa 26-0 (Malan 13, Elgar 13) There isn’t a huge amount happening for Broad.

But all Colman did was sit in a chair looking glum When it comes to television, the Golden Globes have a long history of getting it wrong. Last year it awarded best comedy to The Kominsky Method, for example. The year before that it went to The Marvelous Mrs Maisel. Two years before that the HFPA cast its gaze across the comedy landscape and inexplicably decided that nothing was better than Mozart in the Jungle.With this in mind, you’d be forgiven for thinking something went badly wrong at the Golden Globes last night because, well, its winners were our winners too. Best drama? Succession, which came first in the ’s best TV of 2019 poll. Best comedy? Fleabag, which came second. Best miniseries? Chernobyl, which came third. The acting awards lined up nicely with this, too Succession’s Brian Cox won best drama actor, Phoebe Waller-Bridge won best comedy actress and Stellan Skarsgård won best supporting actor.Even when our tastes erged, it was hard to disagree with the results. FosseVerdon was a flawed series, but it nevertheless hinged on Michelle Williams’ totally committed performance, and she was awarded appropriately. Only a handful of people watched Ramy, Ramy Youssef’s autobiographical Hulu comedy, but it was received so well that his win for best comedy actor came as a happy surprise. Even parts of Ricky Gervais’s monologue – the lines about Apple’s sweatshops in particular – were on point. What on Earth is going on?All this leaves me in something of a dilemma. This is supposed to be the piece where I pull the Golden Globes apart for their poor taste, and revel in all their bad decisions. But I broadly agreed with everything, which puts me in a sticky position. So – and I am truly sorry to do this – it falls to me to take the nuclear option. OK, deep breath.Olivia Colman should not have won her Golden Globe.I know. I know. It’s Olivia Colman. She is spectacular in everything, and she’s been spectacular for so long that we’ve come to expect a baseline of excellence from her. Everybody loves Olivia Colman. I love Olivia Colman. Last year was a triumph for her. She was excellent in BBC One’s Les Miserables. She was amazing in Fleabag. The woman won an Oscar last year, for god’s sake.But I don’t think she deserved to win for The Crown. First, let’s look at who she was up against. She beat Nicole Kidman, who held the second season of Big Little Lies together with her complex portrayal of a woman grieving a man she helped to murder. She beat Jodie Comer, who managed to be even more dazzling and confident in the second season of Killing Eve than she was in the first, which nobody thought possible. She beat Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston for their respective roles in The Morning Show, even though Aniston gave one of the performances of the year.Meanwhile, Colman sat in a chair. Yes, they were nice chairs. And yes, sometimes they were in different places. And, true, sometimes she did more than sit in a chair. Sometimes she looked out of windows. Sometimes, when something made her furious beyond all comprehension, she very infinitesimally flared her nostrils. But that’s all.This isn’t a failing of Colman. It’s a failing of The Crown for underusing her, and a failing of Queen Elizabeth II for not being more demonstrative. Had the material been there, Colman would have clearly given a world’s best performance. But it wasn’t, so she spent an entire series of television sitting on her thumb. What a waste of a brilliant performer.So Olivia Colman shouldn’t have won her Golden Globe, but it’s Olivia Colman so I’m glad she did. Hopefully next year the Golden Globes will go back to being terrible so I have something more substantial to write about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2be75dcdd7a1d5f554cd53da6f6fc7f540b27e77/0_220_5226_3134/master/5226.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb88282c186b2ee23b58362bc0b6d5e","title":"us citizens in iraq tell us about your situation","story":"We’d like to hear from US citizens in Iraq about their situation following embassy advice to leave the country.

It is now an emergency.”Ciro Verdoliva, the director of the local unit of ASL, the administrative facility of the national health service, said the incident reflected a “point of no return”.

It doesn’t work that way.”Responding to Trump’s latest comments, Johnson’s spokesman said there were “international conventions in place that prevent the destruction of cultural heritage”, implying the UK does not believe such threats would be carried out.“You can read the international conventions for yourself. It is the 1954 Hague convention for the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict,” he added.However, Downing Street was careful not to criticise Trump directly, insisting that Britain’s security partnership with the US remained “very close” despite Johnson not having been informed of Washington’s plan to assassinate Suleimani in advance.The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We have a very close security partnership with the United States, we are in regular dialogue at every level.”Asked if Johnson was convinced the US drone strike was legal, the spokesman said: “States have a right to take action such as this in self-defence and the US have been clear that Suleimani was plotting imminent attacks on American diplomats and military personnel.”The spokesman also defended Johnson’s failure to make any sort of statement on the assassination for 68 hours while he was holidaying with his partner on the Caribbean island of Mustique.“The PM was in contact with senior officials and senior ministers throughout the course of Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The government’s position was set out by the foreign secretary,” he said.The prime minister spoke to Trump, as well as Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on Sunday. The UK, Germany and France issued a joint statement urging de-escalation and restraint by all parties late on Sunday night.Johnson also spoke to the Iraqi prime minister on Monday morning, and urged him to allow foreign troops to remain in the country to fight against the threat posed by Islamic State.“The foreign secretary spoke to the Iraqi president and prime minister this weekend. The prime minister is speaking with his Iraqi counterpart today and our ambassador in Baghdad is in touch with political leaders in Iraq to emphasise these points and urge them to ensure we can keep fighting this threat together.”Johnson will meet senior ministers to discuss the Iran situation later on Monday and hold a meeting of the national security council on Tuesday."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131633.1578334618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"flu and bed shortage responsible for record trolley numbers says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe 760 patients waiting for a bed on Monday significantly surpasses the previous high  during the ‘Beast from the East’ storm in March 2018, when 714 patients were waiting. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has blamed record trolley numbers in hospital emergency departments on the current flu outbreak and a longer-term shortage of hospital beds.With an unprecedented 760 patients waiting for admission to hospital on Monday morning, Mr Varadkar admitted hospitals were “severely overcrowded” at present.The HSE said it apologised to all of those affected “by this surge in activity” and it was making every effort manage and improve the situation.The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO), which counts trolleys daily, called for major incident protocols to be adopted across the country, which would see non-emergency admissions stopped and elective medical procedures cancelled.Mr Varadkar, speaking with Minister for Health Simon Harris at Government Buildings, said overcrowding had been exacerbated by a “very severe” flu season.“Predicting a very bad flu season is like predicting a bad storm - and it still happens,” he remarked. “You have to try to manage and prepare for it the best you can.”HSE management have the support of Government to take “any actions necessary” to alleviate the situation over the coming days, he added.Some 92 patients are on trolleys in University Hospital Limerick (UHL) waiting to be admitted to hospital beds, the highest level ever for an inidual hospital. The previous record for the most patients waiting on trolleys in one hospital was 82.The start of January traditionally sees intense pressure on emergency departments and high numbers of patients waiting on trolleys, and flu has come earlier and heavier this winter compared to recent years.The trolley count figure of 760 on Monday significantly surpassed the previous record during the ‘Beast from the East’ storm in March 2018, when 714 patients were waiting on trolleys.Many hospitals imposed visiting bans on Monday and urged people with flu-like symptoms to contact their GP before coming to an emergency department.Mr Harris, who was briefed by HSE chief executive Paul Reid earlier on Monday on the problems affecting hospitals, said the Government was putting “a lot of resources” into support services. As a result, the amount of extra money provided for home care hours meant the number of patients in hospital who were waiting to go home was at an “almost record low”, he said.Fifty extra beds were being opened on Monday and a total of 199 beds would be provided by the end of this month, he said.But Mr Harris said the health service “clearly needs more capacity” and had no surge capacity for events such as flu.In Cork University Hospital alone, 50 patients had flu while in some part of the country, beds were available in the community but hospitalised patients were too sick to take them up, he said.Both ministers urged the public to stay away from hospitals in order to minimise the danger of spreading infection.The figures for inidual hospitals show 56 patients waiting on trolleys in Cork University Hospital, 47 in University Hospital Galway, and 40 in South Tipperary General Hospital.The Government says it has opened an additional 1,000 beds and plans to add a further 2,000 in the coming years.BeleagueredPhil Ní Sheaghdha, INMO general secretary, said the figures show “Ireland’s beleaguered health service continues to break records in the worst possible way”.“The excuse that this is all down to the flu simply doesn’t hold. There are always extra patients in winter, but we simply do not get the extra capacity to cope. This is entirely predictable, yet we seemingly fail to deal with it every year,” she said.The head of the nurses’ union called on the Government to take immediate steps to tackle the emergency department crisis.“We need to cancel elective surgeries, stop non-emergency admissions, and source extra capacity wherever we can,” she said.Róisín Shortall TD, joint-leader of the Social Democrats, described the trolley figures as “shocking”.Speaking on RTÉ radio, Liam Woods, the HSE national director of acute hospitals, admitted “this is not a good day” for the health service.While he disputed the INMO figures, Mr Woods said there was “real pressures” on the health system, amid a shortage of hospital beds and gaps in community care.The health official said capacity would improve with 190 extra beds due to open in the first quarter of this year. These included 40 beds to open in a new unit in Clonmel in the next four weeks, with further beds due to open in Drogheda and Waterford.Winter fluWhile the winter flu season had reached its peak, the stress it had put on the health service would continue to be felt for another two to three weeks, Mr Woods added.As children returned to school there was a risk of flu infections spreading and parents were advised to keep their child at home if they were ill, he said.A number of measures were being taken to ease hospital overcrowding such as reducing the number of elective surgeries carried out.It was normal for the HSE to curtail elective surgery at this time of year, but it was a step taken reluctantly, Mr Woods said.“We need to recognise that the system was running at 94 per cent before Christmas and it is now above 100 per cent occupancy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Local authority to act to take back Edwardian building from hotelier Martin KeaneINMO wants elective surgery cancellations as 760 patients wait for admission to hospitalArea set to be criss-crossed with non-slip pathways to prevent public from hazardMinister criticises those \u0026lsquoseeking headlines\u0026rsquo as mayors say they will not attend ceremonyWoman tells hearing that son has drug problems and comes to her house \u0026lsquoat all hours\u0026rsquoTomas Toleikis (29) claimed he thought they were herbal tablets and legal to sell in IrelandBusiness groups in the region want reimbursement for disruption caused by EU exitCigarette butts are one of the \u0026lsquomost common\u0026rsquo forms of litter, survey findsSearch operation resumes for fisherman lost from trawler off Hook HeadVan driver in his 50s killed in crash on the N21 Castleisland to Abbeyfeale roadFather-of-two James Byrne from Lucan died after workplace incident in June 2018British and Irish governments to publish their view of what would constitute a dealGarda\u0026iacute investigating whether damage was caused by a group attending a funeralWith record numbers of patients waiting on beds, we want to hear your experiencesGarda hospitalised for lower leg injury and then discharged after incident on SundayOrganisers of a rival rally in the city express their opposition to new law on hate speechAlert issued for Donegal, Galway, Mayo, Kerry, Wexford, Cork and WaterfordPeace Plus scheme could be worth over \u0026euro600m for the North and six counties in Republic"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4131897.1578328990!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"northern ireland businesses could demand over 100m in brexit compensation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tShoppers walk along Donegall Place in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Photograph: Hollie AdamsBloombergBoris Johnson is facing demands for cash compensation that could run to more than £100 million (about €118 million) for any disruption caused by Brexit to Northern Ireland’s businesses.Leading entrepreneurs active in the North who met political leaders in a local summit on Friday fear the mooted trade barrier down the Irish Sea after Brexit will mean higher costs for consumers and businesses.“People here did not vote for this future, we should not be expected to pay the price for it in jobs and lost opportunities,” said Colum Eastwood, the newly elected MP for Foyle and leader of the SDLP.Business groups representing 12 sectors in the region have received cross-party support from the DUP, Sinn Féin and other Northern Irish parties for four amendments to Brexit legislation to protect local businesses and consumers. The amendments will be debated this Wednesday.Senior UK government sources have warned of the “high hurdles” that the business groups face to get the amendments through but the groups say they will continue to fight the fight in London, Dublin and Brussels to mitigate the profound impact Brexit will have locally.They are seeking legal guarantees for “unfettered” trade across the Irish Sea and future consultation with the devolved government over any new Brexit regulation impacting Northern Ireland.Their fourth amendment, which was not published over the weekend, calls for compensation.It states “no additional official or administrative costs consequent on any such regulations may be recouped from the private sector”.Potential costWhile no figure has been put on the cost of such compensation, Mr Connolly said the scale of it was clear.“Around the room on Friday it was very clear that for each of the industries the additional costs could run to tens of millions each,” he said, spelling a potential cost of more than £100 million across the board.The groups behind the amendments include the Ulster Farmers’ Union, the Confederation of British Industry, Manufacturing Northern Ireland, the Dairy Council and the Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association.The government is unlikely to be defeated but Mr Johnson could face political pressure as he promised unfettered trade during the UK election campaign.Mr Johnson has promised that Northern Ireland businesses will face “no barriers of any kind”, even telling exporters during the election campaign that if they were asked to fill in any paperwork, they should telephone him directly and he would tell them to throw it in the bin.His remarks were challenged by the EU and by Tánaiste Simon Coveney, who said it was “very clear” when the Brexit deal was done that there would have to be checks on goods coming from Britain to Northern Ireland.This is because through Mr Johnson’s revised withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU customs code, which includes customs declarations and other formalities.Arlene Foster, the leader of the DUP, has accused Mr Johnson of breaking a personal promise he had made to the party on the issue. Mr Connolly said the business groups were trying to work with the government and not “bash” them over Brexit. It was “common sense” that a lorry carrying 1,000 different goods would face disruption, with as many as “800” of the goods facing sanitary and phytosanitary checks coming into Northern Ireland. – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said he is “disappointed” at the decision of some figures to boycott the official commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) in Dublin later this month.A number of mayors have said they will not attend the event, but Mr Varadkar said such mayors could allow someone else from their councils to attend in their stead.Fianna Fáil’s John Sheehan, the Lord Mayor of Cork, and Cathal Crowe, the party’s mayor in Clare, have both said they will not attend the event. Paul McAuliffe, the Lord Mayor of Dublin, will be busy hosting a civic reception for the president of Greece on January 17th, the same day as the RIC and Dublin politan Police (DMP) commemoration in Dublin Castle.Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan and Garda Commissioner Drew Harris will address the commemoration event, which is part of the State programme to mark a decade of centenaries.Speaking on Monday, Mr Varadkar said the Government stands over the decision to commemorate the RIC and DMP.“I think it’s a shame that people are boycotting the event but the Government stands over the decision to hold the event,” he said.In a statement, Mr Flanagan said that the event was part of a drive towards “mutual respect and mutual understanding of the different traditions on the island” undertaken as part of the decade of centenaries, and was not a celebration.“There is no question but that there are very real sensitivities involved here. I acknowledge that. But there are sensitivities on both sides. The RIC has found itself on the wrong side of history. The intolerance that was often characteristic of Ireland in the past sometimes forced people to deny their own family histories and airbrush parents, grandparents and siblings out of the picture for doing no more than serving as an army officer or police officer to support their families,” he said.“It is disappointing to see some public representatives abandon the principles of mutual understanding and reconciliation in an effort to gain headlines. This attitude, combined with a distortion of the nature of the commemoration, is ill becoming of any public representative and represents a step backwards to a more narrow-minded past characterised by a hierarchy of Irishness.”‘Not appropriate’Mr Sheehan had told the Opinion Line on Cork’s 96FM that he didn’t feel it was appropriate for him to attend the ceremony.Former mayor of Cork Tomás MacCurtain was assassinated by RIC officers in March 1920.“When you are having a national commemoration like this you are kind of commemorating the institution. That was a troubled period of history in Ireland and I acknowledge that some Irish people were looking for a wage and a way of living and may have joined the RIC in that context then.“But you are commemorating an institution that does not have a good history in Ireland and took the side of the Black and Tans during the War of Independence. Particularly given Cork’s history with the Black and Tans. The RIC were part of that,” he said.“I don’t think it is appropriate that when we are commemorating all the struggles other people did in Cork and Tomás MacCurtain and Terence MacSwiney, and there we are kind of celebrating the other side.”Last week Mr Crowe said he was boycotting the event, which he described as “historical revisionism gone too far”.Mr Crowe believes it is “wrong to celebrate and eulogise” the RIC, “an organisation that was the strong arm of the British state in Ireland”.In a statement, Mr Crowe said: “In the main, I think all of the Government’s State commemorations have been apt and tasteful but I see the commemoration of the RIC as a step too far.“The guards have my full and upmost respect but I don’t believe that historically or ethically they should seek to claim any form of descent from the RIC.”"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Khamenei weeps as Qassem Suleimani\u0026rsquos successor vows to expel US forces from regionTensions soar as Baghdad views any US role other than fighting Isis as reoccupationFallout continues after killing of top Iranian commander in US drone strike in BaghdadState TV says Iran will not respect any limits set down in pact on country\u0026rsquos nuclear plansIran\u0026rsquos militarist will not be forgotten and the US will not be forgiven for assassinating himHead of Iranian Revolutionary Guards\u0026rsquo elite Quds force, was killed in US strike on FridayTrump defends targeted strike on Suleimani amid threat of major confrontationPopular Mobilisation Forces claim attack hit convoy of medics north of BaghdadQassem Suleimani killed for \u0026lsquoplotting\u0026rsquo attacks on American diplomats and military personnelIraqi militia leaders on high alert, as US recalls citizens from BaghdadKilling of Iranian military commander certain to prompt wide-ranging repercussionsDonald Trump has taken his erratic presidency into treacherous territoryIsraeli PM\u0026rsquos move will delay corruption trial in the hope of an unlikely March election winExtraordinary session of parliament on Thursday to decide on controversial deploymentState television says no immediate reports of casualties, but \u0026lsquoteams are investigating\u0026rsquoIsraeli prime minister\u0026rsquos move effectively turns March election into referendum on matterHundreds demonstrate in Baghdad against American air strikes which killed at least 25Pro-Iranian demonstrators withdraw after violence at US embassy in IraqYoung people in Balata refugee camp grow up trapped in cycles of poverty and violenceUS military carried out strikes against Kataib Hezbollah after rocket attack on contractor"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/20/TELEMMGLPICT000217980236_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMB5T8-A3xmk6BYQ8A56navYRi2AJs9csjE2kaVavFQM.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"touch colour casts new light dickensian lives ordinary victorians","story":"Italian street musicians entertaining passers-by in Victorian LondonThey look for all the world like stills from the latest film version of a classic Dickens novel. But these remarkable pictures were taken not on a Hollywood set, but 140 years ago on the streets of London, among the Victorian capital’s itinerant workers.Only now has colour been added to them by a specialist craftsman, with the intention of bringing the images to life for a modern audience.The photographs of Victorian street life among the poor and low paid were taken during the mid-1870s by the Edinburgh born photographer John Thomson, whose work chronicling ordinary life around him is now regarded as having paved the way for modern photo-journalism.Thomson teamed up with the radical journalist Adolphe Smith and together they produced a monthly magazine called Street Life In London in which they explored the lives, language and daily habits of London’s street vendors, canal workers, buskers and labourers.In a sign of how the capital has long been a magnet for migrant workers and their families, one of the most vivid photographs taken by Thomson shows a group of Italian street musicians, who Smith described as “sons of peasants, agricultural labourers, and others who might lead respectable lives in their own country”.He explained why such people might be drawn to our shores - in language that might be applicable to today’s migrants.A mother with a babe in arms and an older child survey the goods being sold by a ‘swag’ man or barrow boy“They find that a beggar in England is richer than a labourer in Italy,” wrote Smith in his accompaniment to Thomson’s photographs. “The Italian therefore migrates with the knowledge that he may rely on the generosity of the English, and if he only receives as much as many of the English poor, he may hope to save enough to buy himself a farm in his own country.”Among Thomson and Smith’s subjects was even a street doctor, who dispensed cough lozenges and healing ointments to those who could not afford the services of a qualified medic.One of the most striking photographs is that of a woman with a babe in arms and an older child surveying the goods being sold by a ‘swag’ man or barrow boy.The bearded street vendor bemoans the decline in his trade, telling Smith: “There are now too many ‘swags’ and most of them ain’t the gentleman they used to be. I should say there are 1,500 ‘swag’ dealers about London, counting women, boys and girls.”But the stall’s owner comforts himself with the thought he’ll always find customers among the capital’s women, ever mindful of their appearance, no matter how poor.“The profits are much lower at present. But bad as times be, it’s wonderful how women will have ornaments. I have had them come with their youngsters without shoes or stockings, and spend money on ear-drops, or a fancy comb for the hair.”Like Dickens, Thomson and Smith were keenly aware of the dire social conditions in which London’s street workers lived. Smith wrote of the capital’s watermen - who he called “workers on the silent highway - that “it is difficult for them to secure education for their children, and regular attendance at school would be impossible unless the child left its parents altogether.”The photographs have been colourised for the modern eye by Tom Marshall, who has also applied a similar treatment to photographs of soldiers in the trenches during the First World War.Marshall, who spent weeks colourising Thompson’s original black and white photographs, told The : “I believe that colourising images can allow a modern audience to engage better with the subject, especially in an age where we see thousands of images on a news feed every day.“Colour brings out hidden details which are often lost in black and white, and it causes the viewer to pause and look. That’s not to say that the original images are not fascinating in their own right, but I believe that the addition of colour helps to enhance the scene and forces the viewer to spend more time looking into it, and reading the accompanying caption.”Furniture sellers in Victorian LondonThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The scale and enormity of your offending confirms this as an accurate description.The judge continued: Rarely, if ever, have the courts seen such a campaign of rape as this, covering so many victims over a prolonged period.She said the true scale of Sinaga\u0027s offending may never be known but that police appeared to have established 195 men were filmed by the defendant while unconscious.Reynhard Sinaga lived in Montana House win central ManchesterSinaga, the son of a wealthy banker who moved to Britain in 2007, carried out the rapes in his luxury flat in the heart of Manchester’s vibrant city centre.Targeting students and other young men, he would leave his apartment late at night, homing in on those who looked drunk or vulnerable.After striking up conversation, he would invite them back to his nearby flat, with offers of drinks or the opportunity to charge their phones.Once there he would spike them with the class C party drug GHB, which would quickly render them unconscious.He would then rape or sexually assault them, often numerous times, filming the attacks on his mobile phone for his own perverted posterity.Reynhard Sinaga has been jailed for a minimum of 30-yearsThe vast majority of his victims said they had no recollection of what had happened and believed they had simply passed out in the flat after drinking too much.His youngest victim was 17 and the oldest 36, and all but three of the 48 victims identified by police, were straight.For two and a half years, barely a week went by when he did not carry out a fresh attack, sometimes raping two different victims in the same weekend.Such was the success of his technique, that he once picked up a victim, just 60 seconds after leaving his apartment.In April 2017 one of his victims went to police after waking up in an unknown room feeling ill and extremely disorientated.He told detectives he had a vague recollection of being sexually assaulted but was unable to recall where he had woken up believing it may have been in a hotel.Police carried out an investigation but after focusing on the Ibis and Pendulum Hotels, failed to make any progress.The attacks took place in Sinaga\u0026#39s apartmentSinaga was eventually caught in June 2017 when his final victim came round during the rape and managed to fight Sinaga off before reporting him to the police.When officers examined his mobile phone and other digital devices they found a vast cache of horrendous footage showing him in the act of raping his victims.Detectives were able to trace many of the victims because Sinaga used social media to look them up after the attacks, sometimes boasting to his friends that the liaisons had been consensual.Reynhard Sinaga prowled city centre bars and clubs for his victimsHe only used a condom once, but miraculously he tested negative for HIV or any sexually transmitted diseases.Police believe there could be scores more victims who have not yet been identified and are now appealing for any young men who believe they were targeted by Sinaga to come forward in complete confidence.Sinaga was born in Jambi in Indonesia in 1983 into a wealthy middle class and devoutly Catholic family.Reynhard Sinaga moved to the UK in 2007His father was a banker who later moved into the palm oil business.Sinaga came to the UK on a student visa in 2007, enrolling on an MA in sociology at the University of Manchester.In 2012 he began a PhD in human geography at Leeds University, but remained living in Manchester.The rape investigation is the largest in British legal history and it is the first time prosecutors have split charges across four separate trials.Sinaga prowled the bars and clubs of Manchester\u0026#39s Gay Village Jurors were forced to watch extremely graphic videos showing the attacks, and it was thought the impact of being faced with the full scale of his offending would be too much for one jury to cope with.Sinaga only gave evidence in two of the four trials, but claimed all of the sex had been consensual, despite the fact some of his victims could be heard snoring in the footage.In total Sinaga has been convicted of a 159 charges involving 48 men, including 136 rapes, eight attempted rapes, two assault by penetration and 13 sexual assaults.Victims told how Sinaga’s attacks had ruined their lives in harrowing testimony read to the court.One man said he already would have taken his own life had it not been for the support of his mother.Another told of his guilt at having shown Sinaga a picture of his unborn child. Others revealed they had kept their ordeal secret from their friends and family.Another victim said: I genuinely thought he had helped me. How wrong could I be? The day I gave evidence was the hardest day of my life.I have a message to you, Sinaga. I am not going to let your ruin my life. I am going to fulfil my career plans and live a happy, content life.During the hearing, Sinaga showed little reaction to the victims’ distressing testimony, occasionally fiddling with his shoulder-length hair and yawning.As he was sentenced, Sinaga showed no emotion as he stood with his hands clasped together in the glass-encased dock. He then turned around and was led away down the stairs.Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain, of Greater Manchester Police, said: “Reynhard Sinaga is a depraved inidual, who targeted potentially vulnerable men that he had spotted walking on their own after a night out.“To the rest of the world he came across as an engaged member of society who was studying for a PHD qualification and had a small circle of law-abiding friends that he would socialise with.However beneath that façade was a serial sex offender, who we now believe to be Britain’s most prolific rapist. The fact that he was able to cover-up his true nature for so long, just serves as further evidence of his calculating criminal nature.Reynhard Sinaga showed no remorse during any of his four trialsIan Rushton, North West Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor, said: “Reynhard Sinaga is the most prolific rapist in British legal history.“His extreme sense of sexual entitlement almost defies belief and he would no doubt still be adding to his staggering tally had he not been caught. “Sinaga’s unthreatening demeanour duped these young men – many of whom thanked him for his kindness in offering them a place to stay – into thinking this monster was a Good Samaritan.“But once back at his flat he used victims as objects purely for his own gratification – then appears to have derived further twisted pleasure from re-watching his films in court and putting victims through the trauma of giving evidence.”:: Anyone wishing to make a report to the police relating to Sinaga is asked to contact: 0800 092 0410 (calls made from within the UK)  0207158 0124 (international calls).Reports relating to Reyhard Sinaga can also be made online via the Major Incident Public Portal: https:mipp.police.uk operation06GMP19V24-PO2Details of Sinaga\u0026#039s 48 victimsDelhi police accused of turning blind eye to mob attacking students Iran\u0026#39s proxies weigh up their response to Qassim Soleimani killing as Iran vows \u0026#39dark day\u0026#39 of revengeComment: A third war between the West and Iraq is the real looming disasterNaples teenagers hijack ambulance from hospital to take paramedics to treat friend with sprained kneeSpend HS2 funds on improving existing railways in the north, says former deputy boss of reviewLabour leadership: Jeremy Corbyn will stay leader until April 4, party announcesPartner of dying man denied chance to be at his bedside on day he died after she was banned from daily visitsMore people throwing clothes away \u0026#39because they distrust charity donation bags\u0026#39Analysis: Why Iran\u0026#39s rejection of uranium enrichment restrictions is cleverer than it looksMonday evening news briefing: How \u0026#39most prolific rapist in British legal history\u0026#39 Reynhard Sinaga avoided justice for so longComment: Our approach to children and gender is a moral outrage\tPink Panther-inspired thieves swipe dozens of luxury watches in Paris weekend heistsComment: Northern Ireland needs leadership —it may be up to the Good Friday generation to step forwardNora Quoirin: Family of dead Irish teenager sue Malaysian resort for £34,000 saying insufficient security on resortQassim Soleimani: the possible targets for Iran\u0026#39s \u0026#39crushing revenge\u0026#39 over assassinationFrontrunner Jackson Carlaw confirms he is standing for Scottish Tory leadershipBrittany oysters fall foul of gastroenteritis epidemicNew Zealand sends troops to help fight Australian bushfires as £1 billion pledged to reconstruction effortsReynhard Sinaga: How the \u0026#39evil sexual predator\u0026#39 spent years targeting vulnerable young men We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2020","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

We all know the fatalistic logic: the real power lies with the governments of countries such as China, or with the banks that fund the oil industry. What can you or I really achieve with our reusable coffee cups and vegan sausage rolls, other than occupying a rather smug patch of moral high ground, or worse still, creating a comforting illusion that masks the real problem?But there is another point of view. If we take the climate crisis seriously, how can we not want to try, even in some small way, to be part of the solution? Can we really expect the countries and companies that produce the most carbon to change if we don’t show willing to make some small sacrifice in our own lives? And if we all do something, won’t governments and corporations be encouraged to reflect the wishes of the people, even if they are motivated just by winning our votes and taking our money?I’ve sensed this urge to do something while speaking to colleagues recently. And it’s the desire to contribute that has prompted us to create this series of blogs, under the banner “20 Pledges for 2020”. It started on the Lifestyle desk. Did I know, asked one of our staff, that our deputy travel editor was going flight-free for a year? For someone who must receive more invitations for all-expenses-paid trips to the sun than anyone I can name, this was no casual commitment. Then I heard there was a colleague who’s going vegan, and another determined to switch to an electric car. And so the list went on.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWe’re not immune to the bigger challenges and responsibilities of the media. During our recent coverage of the UK general election, we set out to make climate the most important theme for our coverage. Looking back, we led our site and our Daily Edition app on climate issues more than any other major British publisher over the same period – no small achievement – but I can’t say we managed to make it our number-one subject it was perhaps inevitable that the NHS and Brexit dominated the political agenda even on our pages. So one of the blogs you’ll see starting over the next few weeks will be from our politics team, pledging to hold politicians to account over the climate.As for me, I’ll be blogging about how The Independent can use its reach and influence to help fight the climate crisis. This was a challenge set for me directly by our environment columnist Donnachadh McCarthy, who is also part of the media team of Extinction Rebellion. I had always been confident that The Independent was not part of the problem. I’m proud to have worked here at the time when Michael McCarthy, our former environment editor, and the late Steve Connor, our science editor, helped to blaze a trail with their reporting and analysis. The natural world was not always such a fashionable cause back then, but you knew they were on to something from the level of pushback we received – even if sometimes it was impossible not to chuckle along.Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

It’s not like we’re The Independent, we can’t just stick a headline saying ‘Cruelty’ and then stick a picture of a dolphin or a whale underneath it. I mean, that’s just cheating, that’s rubbish.” (With apologies to real fans, I’ve filtered out the fruitier adjectives.) It’s amazing to think how recently such large parts of the media were sceptical towards “climate zealots”, and still are.But Donnachadh put a challenge to me a few months ago: when you look at the Indy, is it really clear that we’re living through a crisis? Couldn’t we be doing more? He was right, of course, and we will do more, so I’ll be blogging to keep you up to date with the changes we’re making.There are three phases to climate journalism as far as I can see. First, journalists had a job to do to convince sceptics that the science is right: mankind’s use of fossil fuels is heating our planet. Then there was the second phase: how fast was the world warming, can we limit the rise to 1.5 degrees, 3 degrees, or more? That’s still a crucial debate, and a subject we will continue to track. But the 20 Pledges blogs belong to a third phase: what exactly are we going to do about it – from government policy, financial regulation and international treaties to our own compromises and choices?Before someone helpfully points out the obvious, I realise that none of us writing these blogs is perfect. I’ll start by holding my hand up: for one thing, I fly from our London office to see our US-based staff, just as our reporters often take flights to report on stories around the world, so I’ll be writing more about that in a future blog post.But this project is not about pretending to be perfect, or virtue-signalling, or being diabolically hypocritical, and we certainly aren’t setting out to preach (there’s enough climate puritanism online already). If, or when, we slip up along the way – when the trip to review a new hotel is too tempting, if the smell of a bacon sandwich catches us at a moment of weakness – we’ll write about those times too. So what are we hoping for? We hope it gives us a richer perspective on some of the more important climate stories we cover in 2020, and that by sharing our own experiences we might encourage others to share theirs too. We’ll try to use our voice to encourage change from governments too.You may want to make a pledge yourself and write a blog through the year about it with us, in which case please do get in touch. You can email all of us writing these blogs at 20pledges@, and you’ll find all the blogs, running through the year, appearing at www.news20-pledges.Your pledge may not exactly change the world by itself, but if you share your story, you never know whose mind you might change along the way.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s almost one a week. Let that sink in for a moment.It wasn’t done intentionally – but, perhaps even worse, completely obliviously. Every other weekend, off I trotted, to Moscow, Doha, Rome and the rest, usually for no more than a weekend at a time. I could say that I excused my high flying lifestyle – pun very much intended – by arguing that it was all for work. With the best will in the world, being a travel journalist was always going to involve a certain amount of travel.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, sadly, that would be giving me way too much credit. The truth is, I didn’t excuse it at all. It never even crossed my mind that I needed to.\u0026nbspUntil, of course, a previously unimaginable and unprecedented shift in the public perception of flying started to emerge. The first time I really realised that a sea change was coming was Emma Thompson’s much-publicised fall from grace, when she flew 5,400 miles from LA to London in the spring to participate in the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations that were bringing the capital to a standstill. The actor and activist was pilloried by the Right and Left in equal measure (the former labelling her a hypocrite, the latter asserting they didn’t need her carbon-tainted help, thank you very much).Created with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

What was the big deal? She was using her platform to add clout to a much-needed protest demanding action on the coming climate crisis. Surely that was a good thing?It wasn’t long afterwards that I heard of the flygskam (flight shame) and tågskryt (train brag) movements for the first time. Originating in Sweden and publicised by high-profile figures including Olympic athlete Bjorn Ferry and opera singer Malena Ernman, mother of teenage activist Greta Thunberg, the idea was to make the notion of flying something a little unsavoury – something you might not want to admit to doing in polite company. On the flip side, the “train brag” movement is all about celebrating rail travel, with participants posting pictures and videos of their beauty-filled overland journeys on social media.Meet the people who’ve given up flyingThe concept has even made its way over the North Sea, as I discovered when I came across the Flight Free UK movement. Founder Anna Hughes’ original aim was to get 100,000 people to sign up and pledge to stay grounded for a whole year.\u0026nbsp“I haven’t flown for about 10 years,” she said, “but given the situation we’re now in, I felt like it wasn’t enough to reduce my own carbon footprint – I needed to open it up and do more. And it took over my life!”I didn’t really expect to be joining the swelling ranks of do-gooders, to be perfectly honest. As journalists, we can easily become accomplished fantasists, convincing ourselves that we are somehow set apart from reality – here to observe and report, rather than participate.But something changed in me after I spoke to Anna, along with a number of other committed non-flyers. They were, to a fault, impassioned and persuasive yet polite and non-judgemental. They were happy to take on huge personal expense and inconvenience, all in the hopes that it might help save the only habitable planet we’ve got. A seed was planted in my brain which grew – slowly but unstoppably – day by day, and has already led to me significantly cutting down on the number\u0026nbspof flights I took in the latter half of 2019.Now, it’s time to take the next step: a year of keeping both feet on the ground. Far from being some po-faced exercise in restraint, more than anything I hope this experience will prove that travel, in all its adventurous, erse and mind-opening glory, is not only possible with clipped wings, but can even be enhanced by taking it slow.I produced somewhere in the region of 6,000kg of CO2 from flying in 2019. Here’s to it being 0kg in 2020.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s time to start asking what the sporting world can do to prevent global warmingIn 2020 The Independent will be doing more than ever before to try and make the world a better place. When it comes to sport, that’s easier said than done.Sport is our escape, a way to block out the realities of everyday life for 90 minutes, or a few hours, maybe even an entire day. It is supposed to be enjoyed even in defeat, and yet not even sport is exempt from the greatest threat to humankind today: global warming and the negative impact of climate change.But not even sport can continue to ignore the perils that will come to threaten its very existence unless something is done to change the path it is on. After all, how will our children and grandchildren play football, rugby or cricket if there are no parks left, or will the next Lewis Hamilton be uncovered if we can’t find a sustainable way to maintain motorsport without the use of oil, petrol and even electricity?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis year we will be delving into how sport affects the surrounding environment, exposing the shocking truths of how it is damaging the world as we know it and highlighting the ways people are trying to bring change for the better.Why will we be doing this? Whether your outlook on global warming is akin to Greta Thunberg or Donald Trump, the truth is that sport has one of the biggest impacts on climate change. Whether it’s the Arsenal squad using a private jet to fly to Norwich, or single-use plastic being used at just about every stadium across the globe, there are endless examples of ignorance when it comes to helping the environment.There will be positives, too. What is Formula E doing to inspire change not just in motorsport but in our everyday commute? What inspired Forest Green Rovers to become the world’s first 100 per cent vegan football club? And are extreme adrenaline sports the answer – they tend to go hand in hand with being at one with the world around us in an effort not to damage it.And if we are to cover all areas of this subject, we will have to take a close look at ourselves too: the media. Is it right that journalists travel all year round aboard the most environmentally damaging transport available in automotive vehicles and aeroplanes, throwing away countless notebooks instead of recycling? If we are to ask the difficult questions, we have to be prepared to answer them too.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There are so many billions of stars out there in the universe that there must be all sorts of different forms of life.She added that although they may not be made up of carbon and nitrogen like humans, it\u0027s possible they\u0027re here right now and we simply can\u0027t see them.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

We were over the Pacific Ocean.The gloriously deep blue seas took my breath away.In the interview, she highlighted how she is often referred to as the first British woman in space, rather than simply the first Briton.It\u0027s telling that we would otherwise assume it was a man, she said.When Tim Peake went into space, some people simply forgot about me.

On Earth, oxygen is created when living organisms convert sunlight into chemical energy – and scientists think the same might happen on Earth.Now scientists hope that the new technique could allow them to spot the same signal coming from other planets, and in so doing perhaps spot planets that might be home to alien life.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

As they do, they block out a specific part of the infrared spectrum, and the new telescope will be able to see that and give scientists a clue to the distant worlds\u0027 atmosphere.Technology like the James Webb Space Telescope is the best hope for examining such distant planets, since they are too far away to ever visit or even to see in much detail, but it requires incredible advanced technology because of the weakness of the signals.Nasa loses contact with satellite monitoring mysterious exoplanetsBefore our work, oxygen at similar levels as on Earth was thought to be undetectable with Webb,\u0026nbspThomas\u0026nbspFauchez, from NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight\u0026nbspCenter\u0026nbspand lead author of the study, said in a statement.This oxygen signal is known since the early\u0026nbsp1980s\u0026nbspfrom Earth\u0027s atmospheric studies but has never been studied for exoplanet research.Spotting oxygen on a planet might not be a guarantee that something lives there. Scientists have proposed alternative explanations that could create oxygen on exoplanets, and so it might not be a definitive indication that the world is alive.​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This revision took it above November’s reading of 49.3.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Any improvement in the sector’s fortune is of course welcome, but this small improvement to the ‘no change’ mark means stagnation is also a possibility,” said Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply (CIPS), which\u0026nbsppublished the report.“Other clouds of uncertainty must also include the potential for further political instability as negotiators and policymakers take the next steps.”Created with Sketch.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The survey’s finding did offer hope for stronger output in 2020. The forward-looking business expectations index was the highest since September 2018.“The modest rebound in new work provides another signal that business conditions should begin to improve in the coming months, helped by a boost to business sentiment from greater Brexit clarity and a more predictable political landscape,” said Tim Moore, economics associate director at IHS Markit, which compiled the survey.Economists said that investors would now be looking for confirmation of a post-election boost in data to be published this month. Thomas Pugh, UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics, said markets would be looking at the “flash” estimates of output from the construction manufacturing and services sector on 17 January to see whether it might stop the Bank of England from cutting interest rates.Top FTSE 100 bosses will earn more than average worker by 5pm today“If this post-election bounce is repeated in other data … then it will probably be enough to prevent more Monetary Policy Committee members from voting for a rate cut,” Mr Pugh said. “But if there isn’t an uplift in the data over the next few months, then the MPC may step in to support the economy.”However, any upturn comes against an anaemic background. The seasonally adjusted composite index of all sectors registered 49.3 in December, unchanged from that seen in November and\u0026nbspthe joint-lowest since July 2016.The stabilisation of service sector activity in Monday’s figures was offset by a sharp and accelerated decline in manufacturing output to 45.6.Economists are not expecting a cut in governor Mark Carney’s final meeting\u0026nbspthis month, with the financial markets only pricing in a 10 per cent chance of a move. However, the odds of a rate move by August rise to evens.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Undergraduates aged between 18 and 19 are 25 per cent less likely to be in work than they were in the early 2000s.\u0026nbspMs Gardiner added: “With young people today expected to end their working lives at a later age than previous generations, it\u0027s understandable that they want to start their working lives at a later age too.“But this lack of work experience can create longer-term problems, particularly if they hit other life milestones like motherhood or ill-health before their careers have got off the ground.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

prepare for the role, declining to say which because “they’ve had enough attention so I’d rather not mention them by name”.\u0026nbspHe appeared to dislike the suggestion that people would assume a Joker sequel would be a cynical or predictable attempt to cash in on the original’s success: “I don’t think that I’ve ever done too many predictable things,” he said. “So if that came up it’s not because Todd (Phillips) or I are following some rule book. It’s because we feel inspired to explore the character more thoroughly. That’d be the only reason for me to do it.”He then asked the crowd: “Have you guys been sitting here all night?

Searches for a number of other related terms threw up similar results.Carolyn Harris, a Labour MP and chair of a cross-party group on gambling-related harm, said the adverts were immoral.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have suspended the accounts in question.”The company says it uses a combination of humans and algorithms to vet adverts and enforce its rules.But on Friday, after Google provided a statement, at least one gambling advert was still showing close to the top of search results for Gamstop“Don’t miss the chance to have fun again,” the advert read.\u0026nbsp”Find the best sites not on Gamstop\u0026nbsphere.”Gambling adverts have been inappropriately placed on Google searches before. In October, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned an ad for a casino app which targeted customers who googled “How to unsubscribe from all gambling”.Trade body the Betting and Gaming Council called on Google and other search engines to update their gambling blacklists to prevent similar problems emerging again in future.Anyone who sees gambling adverts targeting search results for help with addiction is advised to contact industry regulator the Gambling Commission.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In doing so, they claim to have created the world\u0027s most efficient lithium-sulfur battery.“The world needs radical new\u0026nbspenergy storage technologies to fight climate change,” Dr Mahdokht\u0026nbspShaibani\u0026nbspfrom Monash University’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, who led the research, told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Lithium-sulfur batteries, which use extremely high-capacity sulfur, can store five-times as much capacity as traditional lithium-ion batteries, and are made from cheap materials that are available worldwide.”Associate Professor Matthew Hill added: “This approach not only favours high performance metrics and long life cycle... it is also can lead to significant reductions in environmentally hazardous waste.”Battery breakthrough revolutionises recharge times for electric carsThe research, which is published in\u0026nbspScience Advances, could be a major milestone for the battery industry and could impact everything from consumer electronics to solar grids.Dr Shaibani\u0026nbspsaid the commercialisation of the batteries may be between two to four years away, and a\u0026nbsppatent for the manufacturing process has already been approved.Prototype cells have been developed in Germany and further testing in cars and solar grids is set to take place in Australia this year.“Cost projections and performance metrics of our technology predicts for outperforming today’s lithium-ion batteries at high competitive price points,” said Dr Shaibani.\u0026nbsp“Altogether, this means that solar power could be much more easily stored, or an electric vehicle go a lot further, but more importantly, the battery is safe, simple and ethical.”​Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are telling us they’re enjoying the work they do but that they’re still looking for a new job, because something is missing.“Six years into our job exodus research, we’re still hearing that people want to be told ‘thank you’ and one in four people are looking for a new job because they don’t feel valued.“‘Thank you’, something so simple, so consistently important and potentially the best retention tool we’ve got.”Investors in People suggested a number of ways to improve staff wellbeing, reduce stress and increase job satisfaction.A friendly workplace and a supportive culture were cited as the key ingredients to retaining employees. More than half of survey respondents said that having friends at work is important to them, while a quarter admits to staying in a position because of friendships rather than the job.Nearly half (47 per cent) said they would rather have a friendly workplace than a 3 per cent pay rise.British workers put in among the longest hours in the EU, according to separate research by the TUC.The union organisation found that the average full-time week in Britain has shortened by 18 minutes over the past decade, and at the current rate of progress, it would take 63 years for workers to get the same amount of free time as elsewhere in Europe.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both.

Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. Another verse includes the lyrics: “You never cared about grime, you just used it  Worse than Ed with your watered down music.”Stormzy is yet to respond to the diss track, but in a recent interview he likened Wiley to a “drunk uncle” who should “get back to bed”.Wiley, hailed by many as the “godfather of grime”, has taken aim at a number of fellow rappers over the years, including AJ Tracey who he recently mocked for his hit “Ladbroke Grove”, which is a nod to old-school garage music.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He designed it, built it then realised it was far too savage and bitey to live in, say, Milton Keynes.Or the poisonous redback spider which likes to hide under lavatory seats so it can bite a man’s penis when he sits down to do his number twos. No way could God have that living in Europe or the US.He also made a lot of snakes. Some are very pretty and some are very impressive.But occasionally it all went wrong and he ended up with something that could kill a fully-grown man with one small bite. And again, these could not live in populated areas.He needed a home for all these things, so he made Australia.And to make sure people didn’t go there, he put a huge coral reef on the approaches and filled the interior with a sea of sand that goes on for ever.He even used this remote outpost to house some of his more ridiculous ideas. Stuff he came up with when he was drunk.Like those birds that can’t fly and that otter with a beak.Then you have the kangaroo, which gets about by bouncing, and the koala, which is permanently stoned and catches chlamydiaanyone ever picks it up.For millions of years, this big, sandy cupboard under the stairs went unnoticed.But then along came Captain Cook and now the world knows all about Oz and its stupid, dangerous creatures.Plainly, God is embarrassed. Because he’s decided to set fire to it.It’s been argued the fires raging across the country were caused by global warming or out-of-control barbies.But when you look at the footage, you know something biblical is going on.Those things are huge.Skies have been turned red by the flames. Choking smoke is blanketing millions of acres.Thousands of homes have been obliterated. And people are dying.This has happened before in recent years and there’s no doubt it will happen again.Which means people must accept that Australia isn’t meant for human habitation.Soyou’re reading this down there, please come home.You’ll like it. It never stops raining. And we are better at sport.DURING World War Two, General de Gaulle used London as a base and to say a belated thank you, current president Emmanuel Macron is thinking of giving the city France’s highest award for honour.Needless to say, lots of people are now jumping up and down in Paris saying the Legion d’Honneur cannot possibly be given to London as England and France are “hereditary enemies”.No we aren’t. Germany is our hereditary enemy and not just on the football pitch.France, meanwhile, is just some place we visit to buy cheese and wine.We have no idea what it’s like to fight France because it always surrenders before the battle’s got going.ALL of us begin a new decade with hope in our hearts that it’ll be better than the past one.Not me. This is thanks to two things.Firstly, there’s Libya. Since they shoved a scaffolding pole up Colonel Gaddafi’s bottom, it has been a lawless haven for terrorists and lunatics.Today it’s run by factions of the Judean People’s Front and the Popular Front For Judea, with one backed by Turkey and Qatar and the other backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.There’s going to be a bloodbath. And this is a country less than  miles from mainland Europe.Which means we are going to have to get involved. Becausewe don’t, Russia will.That’s one reason, then, that I fear for the coming decade.The other is that at some point in the next ten years, statistically speaking, I am likely to die.TWENTY years ago, Britain created the perfect argument for not allowing anything to be nationalised or run by the Government.It was called The Dome.Created to mark the end of a millennium, it cost £million and was filled by right-on frizzy haired vegans with things no one wanted to see.There was a plastic human you could walk through, a multi-faith zone and lots of global warming malarkey.Unsurprisingly, it was a spectacular flop.So after a year, it was given away to a property company which turned it into the O, a music venue that now rakes in £million a year. Led Zeppelin had their reunion there.As I’ve always said, governments should put up park benches and run the nuclear submarines.And that’s it. Everything  should be run by the private sector.AS we all trudge back to work, with the fog making our hair frizzy and the puddles reminding us we need some new shoes, we will develop a teeth-rattling hatred for all those celebrities on Instagram who are frolicking in the Caribbean or sipping green juices on a beach in the Males.Amanda Holden. Pippa Middleton. Myleene Klass. Grrrr.Except,you think about it, you and I don’t have to find someone to put sun cream on our back five times a day.We aren’t being eaten alive by mosquitoes. And while a wet pavement isn’t very romantic, it’s better than hopping about, yelping, on a superheated white beach.Also, we will not have dicky tummies from the weird food, bad heads from the cocktails, puffy eyes from the jet lag and the constant worry we’ve been papped while bending over.And what’s more, we didn’t have to spend half an hour at an airport waiting for someone in a high-visibility jacket to take an X-ray photograph of our genitals.TECHNICALLY speaking, the fabulous goal scored by Wolves against Liverpool last weekend was not a goal at all.Because careful examination of the footage showed one of the players involved in the build-up was offside by .mm.It may have been three in the morning. The road may have been empty and the skies clear. And there’s no way you should have to waste a day on a speed awareness course as a result.But technology means we live in a time when there is no grey area. Pity.Many of the kids were explaining how they’d given up meat to save the planet and that Greta Thunberg may be Mrs Jesus.But then, instead of actually going walking, they stayed in the car, running its V diesel engine to keep warm.I WAS asked the other dayI’d be starting the year by doing Veganuary.FINALLY, may I wish everyone a very happy New Year.And extend a big thank you to Jeremy Corbyn and Diane Abbott for making such a thing likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it had to act rapidly.Iranian reprisals may be inevitable.But standing back hasn’t done the West much good.The mullahs at least now need to factor in a US President who’s more ruthless than the last.Three days ago Ayatollah Khamenei taunted him over the storming of the US embassy in Baghdad. “You can’t do anything,” he sneered.Trump’s put him straight there.  WHAT is this spell Labour’s Jess Phillips casts over Blairites and media pundits  We don’t get it.We do not doubt her hard work, nor that her heart is in the right place.Many naively believe her Brummie accent makes her the true voice of the working-class — this middle-class, grammar-schooled daughter of an NHS executive and a teacher.But that’s not our real beef. It’s the toe-curling, overwrought Commons monologues designed for social media.And the needlessly vitriolic and hysterical Twitter rants.Consider this gem: “The greatest lie ever told is that Boris is likeable, with cut-through outside ­London.” That aged well, as they say.Phillips may yet be Labour’s best hope as leader, God help them.But to be seen as a serious politician, she should start acting like one. IT is obvious the teenager convicted of lying about her gang-rape in Cyprus signed a bogus dictated confession under duress.Its dodgy English smacks of a foreign cop, not an articulate young Brit.The Foreign Office must act.

He couldnt really say anything.The toddler had reportedly been left unsupervised by staff with a type of glue that causes an exothermic reaction when it comes into contact with cotton - and can sometimes even make the fabric ignite.Jodie said: I found out later that someone at the first hospital, possibly another patient, told staff that they should use Coca Cola to get the glue to separate.And they actually did it! The staff just took someones advice, just someone who was there, they took their advice to use Coca Cola to try to get it off.Eventually Torbens skin stopped burning, but the areas of third degree burn need grafts in order to repair, as the skin will never repair on its own.Jodie said: I didnt know that third degree burns meant grafts. I didnt know that grafts meant possible le-long disability. I didnt know any of those things.Torben is now waiting on the results of his first skin graft, before Jodie hopes to be able to take him back to the UK for treatment at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children.So far the mum has raised nearly £, of her £, target, with strangers from around the world donating to get them home.Jodie said: They left him with this glue, which they shouldnt have had. They took him to the hospital without getting our permission. They didnt call us straight away.He was on his own, without us, just with the nursery staff in the hospital for over an hour. I dont knowhe felt abandoned by us.He was taken to this other hospital and they were taking his clothes off and pulling his skin off and stuff, without us there.Just going through all of that and being alone - that makes it so much worse.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Two days before the flight, she sent him a message…”In , authorities first investigated a mystery woman who made a two-minute phone call to the captain of MH, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, shortly before the plane’s take-off, using a pay-as-you-go SIM card that was obtained under a  identity.It was one of the last calls made to or from the Captain’s mobile in the hours before his Boeing  left Kuala Lumpur.In Malaysia, anyone purchasing a PAYG SIM must fill out a form giving their identity card or passport number, under anti-terror measured brought in after the September  Twin Tower attacks.The mobile number was traced to a shop in Kuala Lumpur, and efforts were made to track down the woman who made the call.Authorities feared the phone call was a possible link between Captain Zaharie and terror groups whose members routinely use untraceable SIM cards.It is not yet clearthe two women are the same person or at all linked.Passengers included Chinese calligraphers, a couple on their way home to their young sons after a long-delayed honeymoon and a construction worker who hadnt been home in a year.But at .am on March , , Malaysia Airlines lost contact with MH close to Phuket island in the Strait of Malacca.Before that, Malaysian authorities believe the last words heard from the plane, from either the pilot or co-pilot, was Good night Malaysian three seven zero.Satellite pings from the aircraft suggest it continued flying for around seven hours when the fuel would have run out.Experts have calculated the most likely crash site around , miles west of Perth, Australia.But a huge search of the seabed failed to find any wreckage - and there are a number of alternative theories as to its fate.Almost six years after the MH aircraft went missing, the new investigative documentary promises to deliver new compelling evidence – including what the authorities in Australia and Malaysia really knew about the disappearance, and exactly where experts believe the plane’s wreckage can be found.Sky News Australia journalist Peter Stefanovic says Malaysian authorities knew what happened to the plane within a week of it going missing, but covered it up.Stefanovic said: “I will reveal the Malaysian government knew what happened to the plane within a week of it going missing – but continued to look in the wrong areas.”“I will also reveal private conversations held between very senior members of the Australian and Malaysian governments.”In the documentary preview, Stefanovic puts the accusations directly to former Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott.Malaysian Airlines Boeing  aircraft was carrying  passengers and crew when it vanished in the early hours of March , , while on a routine flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.The world was left baffled: how could a modern aircraft simply vanish Almost six years on, MH has become the greatest aviation mystery of all time, with the search for the missing jet becoming the most costly in aviation history.Despite hundreds of millions of dollars being spent by Malaysian, Australian and Chinese authorities the plane has never been found, sparking anger in the missing passengers’ desperate families.Until now, the most likely scenario explaining the aircraft’s disappearance involved someone in the cockpit of Flight , probably Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah, re-programming the aircrafts autopilot to travel south across the Indian Ocean in an act of murder-suicide.It is hoped Sky News Australia’s MH: The Untold Story will spark a reopening of the search for the missing aircraft and the passengers on board to finally answer: What really happened to Malaysian Airlines Flight MH "},{"url":null,"title":"get all our great stories with the suns newsletters","story":"Soyoure after the news that always drives the conversation of the nation, the showbiz scoops that will shock you, all the goings-on in football from the clubs to the players to the fans, look no further. to our newsletters today by clicking here now. Key Features:Sun  - Receive the  biggest and best stories of the day, as selected by our editors, sent straight to your inbox so you’re always in the know.Money - The best deals and advice for you and your family.Fabulous - All the hottest trends in fashion and beauty, celeb news and juicy real-le stories.Football - The best columnists, unmissable highlights from your favourite players and clubs and more.TVShowbiz - Get all the latest celebrity and TV news directly into your inbox.Even better, the newsletters learn what you like, so over time you’ll see more of what you want and less of what you don’t.now!

If she’s really troubled about racism in the Labour Party, why did she spend the past three years campaigning to get anti-Semitic Jeremy Corbyn into Number  Andshe’s a serious contender for the leadership, why does she spend half her time doing interviews about herself for glossy magazines Yes, personal brand is important. Butthe country is really in the state Jess claims, shouldn’t she be busy fixing it The Labour leadership contender is determined to paint herself as “likeable” and “relatable” but, right now, she’s coming across as a vacuous narcissist. And a slippery one at that.The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn has so far involved the candidates hamming up their northern accents, trying to out-working class each other, or desperately bigging up their woke credentials to the Press.No one has yet adopted a whippet or done a Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP and potential leadership hopeful who this week described herself out as “pansexual” — attracted to people regardless of sex — but it won’t be long now.For the casual bystander, it all makes for a good laugh.Emily Thornberry’s hysterical claim that her family was once so poor they had to put down a cat sounded so ridiculous in her cut-glass accent, it distracted commentators fromAngela Rayner’s far more legitimate tales of hardship — much to the comical irritation of the latter.For anyone serious about rebuilding the opposition, though, this farcical leadership race is no joke.While Labour contorts itself into a web of wokeness, the Conservatives are quietly cementing their new blue wall in the North.Why  Because outside leftie London and a few university towns, no one cares about tick-box ersity or even the le stories of politicians.Yes, having a “powerful backstory” is usefulyou want to make self-indulgent MPs weepy in the Commons, but it won’t persuade voters that you’re capable of getting things done.And as Boris Johnson proved so decisively last month, getting things done is what counts.The Eton and Oxford-educated Prime Minister looks and sounds nothing like most of the voters in Bishop Auckland or Redcar, but he persuaded them that he was serious about pulling Britain out of a rut.That, it turned out, was enough for an -seat majority.Stuffing the Civil Service full of people who meet gender and ersity quotas is all very well, butyou want employees who bring a fresh perspective, you need recruits who actually think dferently.A tech-obsessed -year-old who skipped university to pursue a career in coding could teach Whitehall’s swarms of humanities graduates a thing or two. And anyone prepared to give up a social le to work for the Government would likely do a far better job than the current civil servants who knock off at pm on a Friday.Bring on the geeks.The Opposition should now take a leaf out of his book.The last election was calamitous, yes, but with  per cent of the vote, Labour is still the second-largest party in British politics.That’s a powerful base for a recoveryit picks the right leader.The challenge is finding that person. As things stand, the field isn’t inspiring.Rebecca Long-Bailey — though a box-ticking superstar — doesn’t have the demonstrable competence that voters are yearning for from Labour.And poisonous Thornberry, who once tweeted a sneering comment about a Rochester home decorated with English flags, will repel patriotic voters.Butthe party is prepared to ditch the ersity nonsense and ignore pious pundits shrieking that the new leader “must be a woman”, the picture is rosier.The unbearably smug Keir Starmer — key player in the doomed People’s Vote campaign — would go down like a ton of bricks in Leave-voting areas.But someone like Dan Jarvis, who has called for Labour to make a “clean break” with the Corbyn era, may just have what it takes.Under Corbyn, Labour proved once and for all that wokeness doesn’t win elections.With the exception of naive students and hipster Londoners, voters don’t much care whether their politicians wear flat caps, headscarves or top hats. They just want politicians who are unafraid to act.So now MPs have a choice.Either they nominate duds with tear-jerking back- stories and shore up their majority in Putney — the right-on London seat which provided the only cause for celebration last time.Or they change tack, abandon wokery, and unearth a strong, competent leader, who might be up to the mammoth task of rebuilding the broken party.It really couldn’t be simpler.PO-FACED leftie commentators must stop laying in to journalists who call Boris “Boris” .They’ve been fighting a losing battle for years. And rightly so.Given Johnson is the third most common surname in the UK, it’s practical – not chummy – to call the Prime Minister by his much rarer Christian name.But, more importantly, the fact our PM is known by his first name on the world stage should be a source of pride to Brits.After three dreary years of Theresa May, Boris’s gravitas and quirky iniduality could hardly be more refreshing.It’s time to embrace it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Rayner, who left school at  without any qualications, will say that Labour should avoid using the language of revolution. The outspoken MP has been credited with pushing Labouraposs National Education Service and championing the Sure Start centres introduced by the last Labour government which helped her to go back to education after dropping out to raise her son. Making her pitch at the Community Centre in the Bridgehall estate where she grew up and brought up her son as a young mum, will say that Labouraposs call for change must be presented as common sense change people can believe in. Rayner, who became political through the trade union movement will unveil support from across the party including Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner and shadow policing minister Lou Haigh. Highlighting the scale of the challenge facing Labour, Ms Rayner will point to seats across the UK that, in a matter of years, have gone from “heartlands to battlegrounds” and where people have felt the Party has “lost touch with them” She will warn: “The gap between generations has never been starker. Our coalition, the foundation of our party, is broken.   “This crisis has been a long time coming and we’ve kept avoiding it. It is the biggest challenge in our history.” Ms Rayner will go on to say that the next five years will be “the fight of our lives” but one that the entire Labour movement must tackle head on. She will say: “The quick fix of a new leader will not be enough.We must rethink and renew our purpose and how we convince the people to share it.Either we face up to these new times or we become irrelevant.The next five years will be the fight of our lives and I’m standing here today because I don’t run away from a fight.” The Shadow Education Secretary was expected to go for the top job but stood aside to help Rebecca Long-Bailey -  her close friend and flatmate.The deputy leader post has been vacant since before the general election , when Tom Watson announced he was quitting Parliament.Ms Rayner, who is widely considered the frontrunner, is expecting to be challenged by Shadow Justice Secretary Richard Burgon and shadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan.The deputy leadership race has so far been overshadowed by the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn who announced he was standing down  in the wake of Labouraposs crushing defeat, when the party won just  seats - its worst election performance in more than  years.He will stay on in the post until the end of March, while a new leader and deputy and are chosen.

She said: I wanted the young girls in particular on this estate to know they are me and I am them and that was so important to me that I came back and acknowledged the role the estate has had on me. Launching her campaign to succeed Tom Watson in her native Stockport she paid tribute to the community where she grew up and who stepped in when she and her family were struggling. But it wasnapost just the people that made a dference- it was the policies of the last Labour government that made Rayner the success she is today - a fact sheaposs been at pains to make despite hostility from some within the party. Speaking at the Bridgehall Community Centre, she said: The dference between me and Boris Johnson is Iaposve walked into a room and Iaposve never been the one that people assume is the natural leader - Iaposve always had to earn the right to speak on behalf of my members and my constituents. Rayner explained how much it meant to do the the launch where she grew up. It was so important to me that I came back here and acknowledged the role that this estate has had on making me the person I am today, she said. Rayner has made no secret about the dficulties her family faced. Neither of her parents were working and she and her siblings used to make the twenty-minute walk to her nanaposs every week for a hot bath. But sheaposs also been open about the support she needed. Itaposs a real sense of community here. I remember as a young child being on the park there and me and my mate - whose mum and dad had substance and alcohol problems she didnapost like being at home very much either and I was thrown out never to be seen and weaposd sit in freezing cold rain underneath the slide together chatting trying to keep warm together in our tiny skirts and little white socks that we used to wear - although they were grey.  Sitting in the community centre that the last Labour government built she lights up as she speaks about where sheaposs from. Pointing out the houses and the playground around the centre, she said: I walked my sister to school here from around the corner and what was nice is, because it was an estate, everyone knew everyone.  She said: I still know everyone. I came back here to do a video and everyone was coming out of their houses to say aposhiyaapos and some of the people I grew up with have got their children on the estate. When she left school she had her son Ryan and got a council flat on the estate. The community helped me raise Ryan for the first few years of his le, she said. It makes me feel really warm - itaposs really nice to be here back on the estate. But there is clearly still a part of her that canapost believe how far sheaposs come. For years Rayneraposs upbringing was seen as a disadvantage. She dropped out of school at  when she fell pregnant with her first child and battled to go back to education. But now she sees it as her strength - helping her to navigate a tempestuous time in politics and the Labour Party especially. My skills - one of the reasons I am running for deputy leader - is that I think my skills are about unity and bringing people together. And actually, I think I learnt all of those things as a young person on this estate. Living in poverty, living on an estate, it can be quite rough. It can be quite jostly, dficult and conflicting, she said.  I learnt how to navigate all of that on this estate, and I think those are the skills as I said in my speech that Iaposve really taken into politics. And itaposs probably why Iaposve thrived so well in what has been quite a turbulent time for most politicians. Iaposve actually quite enjoyed a bit of the chaos. Thereaposs no doubt Rayner has thrived - managing to confound detractors who said she wasnapost educated enough for her shadow cabinet role and digging her heels in when it came to making sure her national education service and early years got the focus she wanted in the partyaposs manesto. But some of the internal battles have not been easy. She explained: What I donapost enjoy though is fighting, bullying, and not getting into government because I didnapost go into Parliament to be a protester. I went into Parliament to make change. Because I saw the change that happened on this estate with a Labour government.  Rayner is clear that the bullying sheaposs seen in the party over recent years has got to stop She said: I experienced a lot of bullying. Iaposve seen it at dferent levels of the party. Culturally the party got into a position where it was internally frustrated, it didnapost know what it stood for. There was a power struggle going on in the party where one side would think it was more righteous than the other. Thataposs not acceptable. Weaposre the Labour Party and we canapost accept that anymore. Weaposve got to call it out.With her pitch to unite the party itaposs clear why she wonapost name names but thereaposs no doubt Rayner knocked heads with some of those around Jeremy Corbyn to whom personally sheaposs stayed fiercely loyal. And itaposs that loyalty that explains one of the reasons she wouldnapost go for the top job against her friend and flatmate Rebecca Long Bailey. She said she “took offence on behalf” of Becky who often gets described as “continuity Corbyn” adding: “one thing I know about Becky and you will know soon,you don’t already, is she is her own woman”. Thataposs a question few will need to ask of Rayner. On her personal politics sheaposs clear.

Runners and riders have been jostling to make their vision heard as they prepare to face off in a contest that will define the future of the Labour Party. Who wins will be defined by Labouraposs ,-ish members - many of whom flocked into the party after  to support Jeremy Corbyn and his left-wing agenda. Long time ally Rebecca Long-Bailey is seen as the aposcontinuityapos candidate to carry Mr Corbynaposs torch - but some in the party fear she wonapost make enough of a splash and want party chair Ian Lavery instead. Remainers Emily Thornberry and Keir Starmer have declared their intentions while Wiganaposs Lisa Nandy, a backbencher who warned for years that Labour could lose northern heartlands over Brexit, is also in the frame. A new leader will be in place on April . Here are all the candidates and potential candidates so far. The new leader will be announced on Saturday  April after a three-month contest to pick the next Labour chief. Candidates will have until Monday next week to gain the support of  MPs - plus either % of constituency parties or % of affiliates . Those who get onto the ballot paper will then face a vote by full members, union affiliates and registered supporters. Members and union affiliates will have until pm on Monday  January to sign up for a ballot. Or people can sign up for a one-off vote as a registered supporter for £. To do this they have just a -hour window to sign up for a vote in the leadership race - between pm next Tuesday and pm next Thursday. The rule is the same one that was used in , when more than , registered supporters applied in two days.Runners, riders and betting odds Declared they will definitely run KEIR STARMER,  -   Holborn  St Pancras  PROFILE: The favourite in internal polls of Labour party members - and is popular among the broader public with Tories privately admitting they’d rather he didn’t get the job. While the shadow Brexit Secretary’s Remain inclinations will no longer be a problem, being a North London man might be. He’s not a union man, but has their respect, and has an impressive CV as he was Director of Public Prosecutions before becoming an MP in . His seriousness and intellect help at the despatch box, but he could do with sometimes showing his lighter side. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He warned the party must not oversteer back to the centre. He said: The case for a radical Labour government has never been stronger”. And he called for the party to take on the narrative that Boris Johnson can aposget Brexit doneapos by the end of January.  LISA NANDY,  -   Wigan  PROFILE: The eloquent backbencher was first elected to Parliament in  having worked for homelessness charity Centrepoint and then as senior policy adviser at The Children’s Society. She has been credited as one of the Labour MPs who “gets it” over Brexit, understanding why many Labour supporters in her Greater Manchester seat backed Leave. The half-Indian politician is a member of the Centre for Towns think tank. She quit the frontbench in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum and her attempts to try to break the Brexit deadlock won her plaudits on all sides of the Commons. Her links with powerful Union unite could help any run. Has hinted at a joint bid with David Lammy. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She argued Labour is facing the last chance to save itself as a whole, not from warring factions, and win back older and working-class voters. Itaposs about whether that traditional coalition that has propelled us into power three times in the last  years can hold good, and whether we can speak for both Lewisham and Leigh.  JESS PHILLIPS,  -   Birmingham Yardley  PROFILE: The powerful voice is one of Labour’s strongest media performers who has the ability to speak “human” and the ability to tack between funny quips and powerful speeches. She is the chair of Labour’s women’s PLP and has been a strong supporter of all-women shortlists - perhaps suggesting she could push for them to be extended to the leadership race. But as she admitted herself on election night, the leadership race is “more than just a personality game and I know that people like me because I have a personality, and that will never just be enough.” WHAT SHEaposS SAID: “Now is not the time to play it safe. What I’ve heard so far in this debate is totally inadequate to the scale of the problem. Voters have changed, the electoral map has been transformed, communication in a social media age is dferent. We need to recognise that politics has changed in a fundamental way by electing a dferent kind of leader. More of the same will lead to more of the same result.”  CLIVE LEWIS,  -   Norwich South   PROFILE: A former BBC correspondent Mr Lewis has straddled the ide in the Labour party between Corbynistas and more moderate MPs. He resigned as shadow Defence Secretary after attempts by Mr Corbyn’s office to water down the party’s support for Trident. But the Norwich South MP has also been a vocal supporter of many of the soon to be ex-Labour leader’s policies. Despite being a confident media performer, his profile has been diminished since he left the Shadow Cabinet. And his compromise position means he hasn’t endeared himself to loyalists on either side of the party’s left right ide - meaning he may struggle to pick up support. WHAT HEaposS SAID: He called for the party membership to be given more powers than they were under Corbyn, backed proportional representation and said Labouraposs indecisiveness over Brexit hurt them. In contrast with most current analysis he suggested that the party had still not gone far enough to break with the Blair and Brown era.  EMILY THORNBERRY,  -   Islington South  Finsbury  PROFILE: An impressive performer - both in front of crowds and on the media. The shadow foreign secretary is a quick thinker, belly-laugh funny and has experience of going up against Boris Johnson at the despatch box. But she quit the frontbench in  after being accused of snobbery by tweeting a picture of a house decked out in St George’s flags, with a white van parked outside. And there are concerns another leader from Islington might not be the answer Labour is looking for. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She stood by her decision to back a second Brexit referendum, saying Jeremy Corbyn was let down and badly advised by top aides. She also called for the New Year Honours to extend to the dead and said she will promise to quit as leader before an electionthe polls and opinion show she canapost win.  Set to declare theyaposll run REBECCA LONG-BAILEY,  -   Salford  Eccles  PROFILE: John McDonnell’s and other Corbyn alliesapos preferred successor for Jeremy Corbyn, the shadow chancellor has been grooming her for the top job. The shadow business secretary’s quiet demeanour belies a fiery passion for addressing social justice. Laura Pidcock’s failure to win a seat has cleared the way for her to be the candidate of the Left. She says sheaposs seriously considering running for the leadership - and will back flatmate Angela Rayner for the deputy leadershipshe runs. WHAT SHEaposS SAID: The MP confirmed she is “considering” a leadership run and will back Angela Rayner for deputy in an apparent joint ticket. Defending Jeremy Corbyn’s legacy, she wrote in the : “Our transformative agenda is principled and popular, while triangulation and soft pedalling will only take us backwards. We didn’t lose because of our commitments to scrap universal credit, invest in public services or abolish tuition fees.” However, in comments which will be seen as an attempt to dferentiate herself from the Labour leader, she wrote: From ex-miners in Blythe Valley to migrant cleaners in Brixton, from small businesses in Stoke-on-Trent to the self-employed in Salford, we have to unite our communities. Britain has a long history of patriotism rooted in working le, built upon unity and pride in the common interests and shared le of everyone. To win we must revive this progressive patriotism and solidarity in a form fit for modern Britain.  Tipped to run IAN LAVERY,  -   Wansbeck  PROFILE: A bruiser who began his career at Northumberland’s Lynemouth Colliery, Ian Lavery was thrown into politics by the s Miners’ Strike. The -year-old succeeded Arthur Scargill as National Union of Mineworkers President in  before becoming an MP in . The Jeremy Corbyn loyalist, whose region backed Leave by % to %, was one of the few Shadow Cabinet ministers to adamantly back Brexit after the  referendum. That led to clashes between the father-of-two, a football, cricket and boxing fan, and top MPs who wanted to Remain. Despite being Labour’s joint elections co-ordinator since , Mr Lavery very nearly paid a heavy personal price over Brexit. His , majority in Wansbeck was slashed to  in the general election as a ‘red wall’ of Labour heartlands turned blue.Mr Lavery was previously dogged by press coverage about £, he received from a union he ran, which by  had only  recorded members. The money included just under £, in termination payments”, when Mr Lavery was made redundant as general secretary of the NUM Northumberland Area on becoming an MP in May . Mr Lavery has always vehemently denied wrongdoing, either by himself or the union, and the Certication Office for trade unions decided not to investigate further in an October  report. WHAT HEaposS SAID: Talk of a second referendum was seen by many as a way to foist Remain upon them. Communities represented by Labour for generations felt abandoned. It is time to outline a positive vision of the future outside of the EU. Divided parties can’t win. Let’s get back to debating in a forthright but respectful way, remembering what we have in common and stop reinforcing press attacks on our own party.  DAN JARVIS,  -   Barnsley Central  PROFILE: The state-educated son of a lecturer and probation officer went to Sandhurst and served in the Parachute Regiment in Kosovo, Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan, rising to the rank of Major. He resigned from the Army to fight and win a by-election in . Despite being tipped for stardom in the days of Ed Miliband, heaposs had a very low profile under Jeremy Corbyn - even though he is juggling two elected offices, as MP and Mayor for the Sheffield City region. Ruled themselves out, or are set to pull out YVETTE COOPER,  Pontefract  Castleford  PROFILE: Yvette Cooper saw her odds slashed from   to   after she said she was considering throwing her hat into the ring. She is seen as a competent politician having chaired the Home Affairs Select Committee and with respect from MPs from the parliament. But four years ago she lost to Jeremy Corbyn . The former Cabinet minister who came second in the contest in  winning % of the vote compared to Mr Corbynaposs % said she would decide over Christmas whether to enter the race. Ms Cooper, who saw her majority in Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford slashed from , to , last week, said the party needed to move away from the politics of both Mr Corbyn and Mr Blairit was to win back the support of patriotic older voters who abandoned it for the Tories. We cannot just become a party that is concentrated in cities, with our support increasingly concentrated in erse, young, fast-moving areas while older voters in towns think we arenapost listening to them, WHAT SHEaposS SAID: She said both the left and right of the party are seen as internationalist rather than patriotic and Labour mustto its support in towns and former heartlands, not just the erse young fast-moving cities in England. However the Mirror reported she was unlikely to run after taking soundings from colleagues.  ANGELA RAYNER,  Ashton-under-Lyne  Long tipped for the top job, her back story of rising to the top of politics despite leaving school after getting pregnant at  is inspirational. She later trained as a care worker and eventually became a trade union representative with Unison, who would be likely to back her for the top job. The shadow education secretary has become an increasingly polished performer, but Labour insiders claim that she is still a work in progress. But sheaposs going for the deputy leadership instead.

A study of , UK adults, whoaposve holidayed in the last year, found they spend  hours over a seven-day holiday - the equivalent of am until :pm - wasting time. The average holiday-goer spends nearly an hour a day venturing between their accommodation and sights,  minutes choosing what to do and researching places to eat, and nearly a quarter of an hour worrying about work. However, they still manage to squeeze in a -minute nap, nearly an hour and  minutes is dedicated to activities and sightseeing, and just over an hour a day is spent properly relaxing.  you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break  Graham Donoghue, chief executive of Sykes Holiday Cottages, which commissioned the study, said: Thereaposs now so much choice when it comes to accommodation and activities that,you donapost plan ahead, you might find yourself wasting your time away and not truly enjoying your break. A little time spent researching restaurants in advance and deciding what to do can make a big dference to your holiday. Itaposs really worth it when you think about how easy it is to find recommendations and make bookings online. The study also found that, despite spending more than an hour a day going for walks,  per cent of travellers would like to enjoy more of this during a break away. And regardless of a similar amount of time spent eating out, two-fths would like to devote more of their vacation hours indulging in delicious restaurant dishes.  A quarter of holidaymakers think they squander too much time deciding what to do, and the same amount reckon they spend more time doing what others want - than what theyaposd prefer themselves. As a result,  per cent have argued with people theyaposve holidayed with over plans for the trip ahead. In fact, before the break has even begun, adults say they spend two and half hours planning their break, with a third thinking planning is key to having a successful holiday. However, working long hours, looking after children and getting chores done at home are among the barriers to holiday-goers being able to plan in advance. More than one in  will even expect someone  to take the reins, while nearly a fth leave things to the last minute when itaposs often too late to make any advance plans.

East Lindsey District Councilapossnew rule change has left owners of older vans at the Kingfisher Caravan Park with no choice but to sell them for less than they bought them, reports Lincolnshire Live . The site now looks totally bare with pictures and drone footage showing just how many empty spaces are scattered around the park. I had a walk round the site - it has been absolutely decimated with vans moved off, said one man.The decision has caused complete outrage among van owners, many of whom have been forced to sell because most sites on the East Coast donapost accept vans over a certain age. We got rid of ours from Kingfisher. [Weaposll] never buy one again, they explained. Have you suffered from the controversial rule change  Email webnews@mirror The council announced its decision in October  and all owners with vans  years or older were given a yearaposs grace period to see how they would like to proceed. Anyone with caravans aged between  and  years will be subject to an annual inspectionthey want to stay on the Kingfisher site. After seeing photos circulating on social media, people have responded with sadness. What a sad day for the owners of these vans, wrote one person. Another said: Itaposs so sad. Was always a lovely FULL site. People who have had caravans on this site for years have sold up and left due to the new rates and rules. So sad to see. The council has responded to explain their decision is all in the name of sustainability. A spokesperson for ELDC said: The decision to introduce the new multi-year licences has been taken firmly with licensees and the continued sustainability of the site in mind. The longerof the licence offers our licensees a greater peace of mind around the viability of what is a signicant investment – much more so than the annual licence previously offered.  Those iniduals whose caravans no longer meet the requirements for one of the new licences are free to move their caravan to another site, we are in no way saying they must get rid of their caravan. “Our licensees will also benefit from an increase in the residual value of their caravan at the end of the licensing period, compared with what they would have at the end of  to  years – meaning they will see a greatershould they choose to sell or part exchange it. This will also remove situations we currently see where licensees are having to pay to dispose of their old caravans or are simply walking away from them which leaves us to chase them to recover the debt.

Sam Hemingway, , also scrawled the words aposKunta Kinteapos and aposTobyapos - referring to a slave character in TV show Roots - before giving the pizza to driver Nathaniel Ramsey. Mr Ramsey was entitled to a free pizza as part of his job for the takeaway firm - but twice found racial slurs written on the side of his boxes. The word was written in pen on the bottom of the box under the pizza given to Mr Ramsey by Hemingway. A court heard Mr Ramsey confronted Hemingway and asked himhe thought it was OK to be racist at work.  But the court heard supervisor Hemingway dismissed it as banter. Mr Ramsey complained to police and Hemingway was charged with racially aggravated harassment. The two men worked at a Dominos branch at the Island Green Retail Park in Wrexham, North Wales. Mold magistrates were told there was very childish behaviour in the workplace. Hemingway admitted two charges of racially aggravated harassment over the slurs in February last year.  Ian Barnes, defending, said Hemingway lost his job as a supervisor over what had happened. Mr Barnes said Hemingway and Mr Ramsey had been friends and had previously been to each otheraposs birthday parties. He said the pair had regularly enjoyed banter as part of their jobs working in the busy pizza takeaway. He said: This is a case of banter thataposs just got out of hand and crossed boundaries. He is embarrassed over what has happened.  Hemingway, of Wrexham, was fined £ with and ordered to pay £ compensation, £ costs and a £ surcharge. Magistrates chair Andy Stubbs said: This is behaviour that has gone beyond banter.

MasterChef host Marcus Wareing, who runs Michelin-starred restaurant Marcus, has shared his mash method in his new book Marcus Everyday. Mashed potato, a British dinner staple, are usually served as a side dish to meat or vegetables and can be made using peeled or unpeeled potatoes. Milk, butter, salt and pepper are frequently used in preparation to add flavour to the mash. But itaposs not easy to perfect. In his recipe compilation, the cook urges readers to follow three steps. “Cut evenly, cook evenly and don’t rush”, he advises. The TV chef adds that many make the mistake of cutting their potatoes to dferent sizes, the Daily Star reports. Other common errors people make are boiling them too quickly and failing to leave them to rest. Here are some of the cookaposs tips for a perfect mash... . Cut the potatoes evenly  Marcus Wareing says it is important to peel the potatoes cleanly, then wash them and make sure they are cut into evenly sized piece. This is because,they are dferent sizes, the smaller pieces will overcook and they will absorb water, which can make your mash tasteless. . Boil them slowly The potatoes need to be cooked in salted water at a slow boil. If boiled fast, the outside will be overcooked before the middle of the potato chunks is cooked through. This will create dferent consistency in your mash and make it unpleasant. . Leave them to rest  Once the potatoes are cooked, you should drain and leave them for a good five minutes. After shaking them around, you can put them back in the pan, off the heat. Once they have rested, the potatoes are ready to be mashed to your liking, adding butter, cheese or herbs. A potato ricer helps in the process of making mashed potato. Most people use Russets for mashed potatoes because of their high starch and low water content, according to Simply Recipes . Yukon Golds, which are a little more expensive than Russets, are another popular alternative as they are naturally creamy when mashed and have a slightly buttery flavour of their own. Marcus explains: “First, peel the potatoes cleanly, then wash them and cut them all into evenly sized pieces, otherwise the smaller potato pieces will overcook, and before they break they will absorb water, which will make your mash watery and tasteless.  “Boil them in salted water at a slow boil – a fast boil will overcook the outside before the middle of the potato chunks are cooked through you don’t want lumps of overcooked potato in your mash. “Once the potatoes are cooked all the way through, but not quite falling apart, drain and leave them for a good five minutes, then shake them around and put them back in the pan, off the heat. “The potatoes should then be hot enough to take the butter on board.

We havenapost seen Meghan and Harry together on royal duties since Remembrance Sunday, when they joined other members of the Royal Family for the service at the Cenotaph.

The hard-hitting show documented the daily lives of people living in James Turner Street in Winson Green, an inner-city working class area in Birmingham - warts and all. Residents in the bustling street were seen trying to make ends meet evenmeant breaking the law by shoplting, committing benefit fraud and growing cannabis. The nation was hooked and tuned in to watch the ins and outs of people living in the Victorian terraced houses including Deidre Kelly , Samora Roberts , Smoggy , James Clarkeand Lee Nutley. Six years on and the street is a a quieter place with new families residing in the properties which were once home to those who stared in the documentary, Birmingham Live reports. However, the street still has its issues with litter scattered across the pavements, fly-tipping and homes blighted with mice infestations. One mum-of-two was moved to James Turner Street by Birmingham Council after she was deemed homeless and in need of temporary accommodation. She said: I said I didnapost care where I lived, I just wanted a roof over my head, until I came here. Every time I step out my door, thereaposs litter everywhere. Iaposve only been here since July, Iaposm trying to get out.  I was homeless and living in a Travelodge. At least it was nice and clean in there. We had a mice infestation here, but we got a cat so thataposs sorted it.  Many of the residents are in a similar situation and said they had been moved to the street by housing associations or the council. A dad-of-five said his family were moved to the road from Richmond, south west London, because he couldnapost afford the capitalaposs prices. The move meant leaving family members behind, but he has made new friends on the street - which he says still retains its community feel, despite its problems.  He said: I was terried at first, all Iaposd ever heard about Birmingham is itaposs a s*** hole, donapost go there.  Iaposve been through so much. Iaposm just happy to have a roof over my head, evenitaposs a s*** one. But the people are nice. The other night they all come out, everyone was out watching the fireworks. Itaposs a nice community, itaposs not like London,you dropped on the floor, theyaposd walk past you, here theyaposd stop and help. Everyone says hello, youaposve got the odd couple, but it is nice. I do like the people. He has lived in the street for three years and has noted a number of disturbing incidents, including a-year-old girl forced to move with her family after being sexually harassed, a delivery driver being carjacked and a family unable to wash their  kids for more than a year.  I wish Iaposd come here [Birmingham] earlier, just not this street, he said. Iaposve seen a gentleman get out of his car bringing a food delivery, and as he got out, one of these lads jumped in it and drove off. He also said one family who lived across the street survived with no running water and no electricity for a year-and-a-half. The people, they donapost deserve to live in the s*** theyaposre living in. Because they are living in filth, he said.  There was a family up the end there, there was a lot of them. The landlord done f*** all. Not a f***** thing. They must have had  kids and they never had a wash as long as they were here. You would see and smell them walk past, it would break my heart. Some of these people, I can see in their face they are just depressed. Some of the people are the closest to animals I have ever seen people be. One -year-old girl, the boys would not leave her alone. In the end the police had to get involved, they had to move them.  Speaking about illegal dumping on his street, he said: It seems like itaposs just left, once it gets in a mess, they leave it a mess. You canapost leave nothing out,I left my buggy there, went in for half an hour, Iaposd come back and guarantee itaposs gone. His partner added: Theyaposd rob the eyes out of your f***** head. Basoz Ali moved into the street with her family after their landlord in Perry Barr asked for their property back.  The young family, who have two children, are living in temporary accommodation with the council. The -year-old said: Itaposs so dficult, we feel like weaposre ignored. We feel neglected.

This was after sheaposd also had to pay extra to fly from a Scottish airport. The holidaymaker joked that she will not be ing alive from the Wowcher break, which begins on January  and lasts for three nights, reports the Daily Record . After buying the £ deal, which sees customers paying for a holiday without knowing where thereaposll be going, Bryony was excited to finally find out she would be heading to Hungaryaposs popular capital. Have you had a bad experience with Wowcheraposs mystery holidays  Email webnews@mirror    Despite discovering sheaposd have to pay an extra £ to fly from a Scottish airport. That was until she looked at where sheaposd be staying. When Bryony and her mate found out theyaposd been booked into the three star Hotel Fortuna, they checked itaposs TripAdvisor reviews. What they were met with pretty horric. Despite being in a central location, Bryony described pictures of the hotel as looking like a crime scene. The bathrooms were grimy with hair in the shower, there were cobwebs at the windows and there was an odd fence next to the bed. A TripAdvisor reviewer named Dani R went on a rant about the hotel, saying in the bathroom, towels dirty and in the shower curtain, hair of other people. He added that there were spider nests and spider eggs. I write here in the intention that nobody ever have the same experience than I. Itaposs a pity for Budapest!! Really. Donapost choose Hotel Fortuna at all!  With an average rating of just two and a half stars on TripAdvisor, plenty of other holidaymakers felt the same about Hotel Fortuna. This place is horrible [...] The place needs serious updating and very serious deep cleaning, Katie D said. One person, Pauline C, did actually give the hotel four stars. She wrote: It needs an uplt, however itaposs quite reasonable and good value for money with larger than normal rooms. The breakfast is more than sufficient. What makes this hotel so special is the efficient and kind hearted receptionist with very good mastery of English. But Bryony was having none of it, taking to social media to tell her story.  Right so booked the  Wowcher Mystery Holiday  last year, she said. I go away in about  days. Just checked the hotel am staying at and a can confirm - it looks like a f******  ket den  .

The billionaire paedophileaposs death was officially ruled as suicide by hanging at Manhattan politan Correctional Center, despite speculation and conspiracy theories he was murdered. The graphic photos show the deep bloodied cut to the -year-oldaposs neck and the severed neck bone, as well as strips of orange sheet fashioned into nooses, with one looped through a bed post inside his cell.  Obtained by  Minutes and broadcast for the first time in America on Sunday, the images were captured last August with Epstein having taken his own le while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges. They also show other bed sheets strewn across the floor, fragments of material dangling from a window, his body on a trolley and a handwritten note complaining about conditions.  Almost three months on from the disgraced financieraposs death, Dr Michael Baden, who was hired by the paedophileaposs brother, Mark, to observe the post-mortem, suggested Epstein could have been strangled by someone in his cell.  In an interview with Fox News, Dr Baden - a former coroner in New York - rejected the official findings and claimed Epsteinaposs body bore telltale signs of homicide. The -year-old said Epstein had two fractures on the left and right sides of his larynx, specically the Adam’s apple, and a broken left hyoid bone above the Adam’s apple. Dr Baden, who has probed cases involving OJ Simpson, President John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jnr, said: “I think that the evidence points toward homicide rather than suicide. “Those three fractures are extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation. In his -year career he has not seen a suicidal hanging case where those injuries have occurred, he said, adding: “Hanging does not cause these broken bones. Homicide does.” There were also haemorrhages in Epstein’s eyes that were common in homicidal strangulation and uncommon in suicidal hangings, he added.  Dr Baden, a Fox News contributor, claimed there were signs of “unusual” activity “from day one” of the autopsy. New Yorkaposs medical examiner has not yet responded to his claims. He called for a fresh investigation into Epsteinaposs death, saying a number of people would have to be involvedit was a homicide. Evidence on the ligature could help to prove whether someone was involved in Epsteinaposs death.  The expert also cited a “total breakdown in security” around Epsteinaposs cell and rejected claims that the guards had fallen asleep as two CCTV cameras maled. Dr Baden said his own investigation is not complete. He has examined more than , bodies during his career and hosted the HBO programme Autopsy.  Just weeks before his death, Epstein was found on the floor of his cell with marks around his neck in what was thought to be a possible suicide attempt at the time. He was put on suicide watch but removed a week later. He was not sharing a cell with another prisoner at the time of his death. The guards responsible for keeping an eye on Epstein the night he killed himself have been charged with falsying records and conspiracy.

However, it comes with a bit of a catch. While this treat may sound ideal for all those taking part in Veganuary, it turns out, itaposs not actually suitable for vegans or vegetarians. This is because the Rebel Whopper is cooked on the same grill as beef burgers, meaning a great deal of non-meat eaters wonapost be able to consume it. Understandably, this has caused controversy with many people taking to social media to share their frustration.  One disgruntled person wrote: Not suitable for vegetarians let alone vegans. What is the point Another asked: How can Burger King be so unbelievably stupid  Theyaposve a new veggie burger which they are cooking on same grill as the dead ground up into tiny pieces cow burger, so it gets covered in cow fat.It takes a special kind of stupid to take a vegetarian burger and render it inedible to vegetarians, wrote a third.Someone  added: What a wasted opportunity. Burger King have shot themselves in the foot by not making the meat free burger available to vegetarians like me and those on a plant based diet. Didnapost Greggs vegan sausage roll success teach them anything  Commit!  Despite the backlash, Burger King believe their new product is a game changer. The soy-based burger is being targeted at flexitarians, people who wish to cut down on their meat consumption. Katie Evans, the marketing director for the fast food chain, said: This really is a game changer - we wanted our first plant-based Whopper to replicate the indulgence and flame-grilled taste of the real thing as closely as possible, and weaposre thrilled with the result. Weaposre delighted to satisfy the demand for this highly-anticipated product and finally bring the Rebel to the UK. And it seems there are some who agree with her and support the launch.This plant burger has been available in Australia for months from Hungry Jacks , replied one Twitter user. I donapost think vegans want something that looks like a bit of cooked dead animal meat anyway. It is actually quite good and replaced my meat burgers from BK HJ.A second agreed, adding: Vegans should not be going to Burger King.

Not only are they a joy to look at, their kind nature also means they are likely to be the goodest boys and girls you will ever have the pleasure of meeting. So it came as a bit of a surprise to thousands on the internet when actor and comedian Andy Richter shared an MRI scan of his friendaposs dog to discover that manaposs best friend was downright aposterryingapos on the inside. And although many found amusement in scan of the poor little pug, a vet has said it also highlights the concerning results of selective breeding which have a detrimental impact on the health of the breed. Andy tweeted the image from the scan showing the dogaposs signature bulging eyes with the caption: aposMy friendaposs pug went to the vetapos. Itaposs attracted more than , likes, with many left in stitches by the results. One replied: This made me laugh uncontrollably for two minutes straight. Another said: Amazing. Pugs may be the only creature to look exactly the same in X-Ray as in visible light. Some were slight unsure, with a third writing: That is simultaneously the cutest and most terrying thing I have seen in my entire le. Thank you for the happy nightmares this image will bring me tonight.  After the tweet went viral, Andy added an update to let everyone know that the pug was given a clean bill of health and was aposnonplussedapos by its new found fame.Rory Cowlam, a vet based in London, told the Independent that although most MRI images, including those taken of humans, would look unusual to the untrained eye, he conceded the pugaposs snapshot was apospretty odd lookingapos Dr Cowlam said: Their faces have been shortened due to intensive breeding by humans, unfortunately. They have these massive eyes, bunched up noses - the condition is called brachycephalism. We have, through human selection, bred them to look more like a human baby because we find that cute, but unfortunately that cute look is not very good for the animal. With other breeds including French bulldogs and Shih Tzus also suffering from the same condition, Dr Cowlam said he would aposactively encourageapos prospective owners to think again about buying animals with brachycephalism.

That is just a small introduction.Ironically, the legislation was conceived in Scotland. Back in  my friend, the late, great socialist Bob Holman, invited Mr Duncan Smith, then Tory leader, to visit Easterhouse in Glasgow.So apparently moved was he by what he saw in those tenement blocks that Mr Duncan Smith established the Centre for Social Justice , which became the conceptual cradle for many a Conservative policy he later embedded in legislation in his role as secretary of state for work and pensions.My we informed me that a petition had been uploaded calling for the revocation of his knighthood and had attracted fewer than , signatories.I told her it would be up to more than , in less than a day – the number needed to secure a House of Commons debate.Two days on and it hit ,. One signatory, Lynne Saunders, wrote: “This man should be prosecuted for murder, not knighted.”At the time of being published, almost a quarter of a million people had signed, calling for Mr Duncan Smith#s knightood to be revoked. I would hope there is a debate and that it includes the fact that foodbank use in Scotland rocketed by % in the year after the Act became law, and the story of the mum I met in Paisley who gave up breastfeeding her six-week-old because she was too malnourished following an administrative error that withheld a benefit payment.The truth is, the greatest heroes often go unsung and the honours system we currently have is just another farcical seam in an imperial tapestry that is becoming increasingly redundant in the eyes of a growing number of people in Scotland.My friend Bob, who sadly died in June , shared my view on the honours system.He turned down an MBE in  due to his belief that it promotes dferences in status.Now that, I believe, is worthy of honour."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-fell-love-marlene","story":"MAGNETIC, marvellous Marlene Dietrich made the front page of the Evening Times - of course - when she came to Glasgow on November , ."},{"url":null,"title":"greatest-gift-glasgow---burrell-collection-marks-75-years","story":"WHEN Sir William Burrell gave his collection to Glasgow  years ago it was described as ldquoone of the greatest gts ever made to any city in the world."},{"url":null,"title":"back-day-glasgows-first-boom---12th-century","story":"THIS week we travel back to the late th and early th century to see how Glasgow went from a small settlement of Christians to a growing presence in Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"dedicated-fans-britain-away-day-glasgow-clan","story":"For years, it has been seen as a badge of honour amongst sports fans, especially football fans in Scotland, with away attendances seen as a source of pride or embarrassment."},{"url":null,"title":"five-fitness-alternatives-joining-gym-glasgow-new-year","story":"ON TUESDAY evening, millions of people across the world celebrated the end of a decade and the beginning of a new one."},{"url":null,"title":"food-rationing-glasgow---80th-anniversary","story":"JANUARY is traditionally a lean month. as families recover from the excesses of the festive season by choosing to diet, drink less and live more economically."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-metro-plans-track","story":"PLANS for a city-wide Glasgow metro tram network are moving forward with a link between the airport and Paisley the first phase."},{"url":null,"title":"bumper-gig-guide-glasgows-2020-music","story":"ITrsquoS January.

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event. And to Gavin #Top Tog# Brown, who has been an avid rally man for years and continued to watch us all through the lens, capturing some of our most heroic moments. was a busy year, with a few of us still tinkering away in sheds.  will hopefully see theof Ally and Del Galbraith in their #new# MK Escort and Donald Bowness in the giant killing Nova making aafter some time out.PICS:Dougie Watt and Ian Parker flying in Finland before winning in Aberdeen Photo: Jii Pihlaja. no_a_RallyFinlandFather and son duo Craig and Ross Callendar came in th overall at this year#s Mull Rally.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird. We look forward to supporting the project to make sure that Golden Eagles flourish in the south of Scotland.Project partners include RSPB Scotland, Scottish Land  Estates, Scottish Forestry, Scottish Natural Heritage, and the Southern Uplands Partnership.Funded by The National Lottery Heritage Fund, project partners, Scottish Power Renewables, the Scottish Government and local LEADER Programmes, the initiative is a key project under the Scottish Governmentrsquos  Challenge for Scottish Bioersity."},{"url":null,"title":"melrose-sevens-bosses-make-u-turn-road-closure","story":"BOSSES at Melrose Rugby have made a U-turn on their plans to close off St Marys Road during next years sevens.As previously reported, the stretch was due to be shut for two weeks ndash to allow for a temporary stand to be erected.But following discussions with the towns community council, chiefs running the four-day tournament have changed their minds.Now St Marys road will only be partially closed on game days, with a traffic light system in place.Philip Morris, sevens tournament director at Melrose Rugby, said: ldquoAn event like this one will of course come with an element of disruption to the usual routine.\"The Melrose community has embraced the sevens every year, however, concerns around an expanded event are of course completely understandable.\"For the avoidance of doubt, wersquore working really hard to support local businesses as suppliers to the event.\"And wersquoll also be consulting with local residents to address any specic concerns they have too.\"We are confident the economic boost to Melrose and the surrounding Borders towns during the expanded sevens event will be huge.\"News of the U-turn has been welcomed by members of Melrose Community Council.Chairman William Windram said: \"I still think the plans are a bit fluid at the moment, and I think there is still a lot of work going on behind the scenes.\"There are, however, still some issues like late night noise that have not been considered yet, but we have asked them [the club] to come back to our meeting in February to give us an update.\"Some amelioration has certainly taken place and we should be pleased.\"One of the concerns raised by Melrose Community Council at its November meeting was the impact the tournament would have on churchgoers ndash with the event taking place over the Easter weekend.In response, Mr Morris said: \"We are working hard to ensure the important Easter Sunday church service is not impacted and people will be able to get to and from the church without signicant disruption.\"Now the traffic situation on St Marys Road is becoming clearer, we have a plan that we feel will satisfy our local residents.

Her wee brother Pavel was having lots of fun. She waved at him and he waved back, throwing a snowball at the window, then rejoining his friends.Marcela ed to her book. She loved reading, it was her escape into other worlds. She could not enjoy the snow like her wee brother, for she had been in a wheelchair for all her le and the chair would stick in the snow.It was possible to go outside with help, especially when her father was home, butshe tried it herself the front wheels would stick in the snow and ice.It was humiliating so she preferred to stay inside with her books and imagination. But she read by the window, watching her brother and class mates having fun.Then a robin landed on the window sill. It seemed to stare at Marcela. She looked at the wee bird and smiled.ldquoLucky you she said ldquoI wish I had your freedom and that I could fly like you.The little birdrsquos head turned to its side asit was saying something. Then it flew away.Soon after it was December , the day Christmas was celebrated in these parts, and presents were given. There was not a pile expensive gts, but a few simple ones and always one specially unusal present for each child.The family were poor, but anticipation of what the unusual gt would be was always a highlight of Christmas.Pavel opened his first. As he unwrapped it his eyes gleamed with excitement.ldquoYes! he called out, hugging his mother and father. It was a huge bottle of ketchup, the real stuff! That may not sound such a present, but it was not easy to get this kind of ketchup in the village and he had always had to use it sparingly. Now he had this bottle all to himself.Then Marcela open her unusual present. She smiled as she held two unusual looking carved short planks of wood, unsure initially what they were. Then she smiled.ldquoAw perfect, bookends for my shelf.ldquoThere are not bookends, said her father.

She nervously wheeled her chair onto the snow covered front path. Usually the wheels would stick within seconds, but this time her chair slid effortlessly along the path.Soon she had got the hang of manoeuvring the chair in the snow. She had snow ball fight and was able to spin around and chase her schoolmates while storing lots of ammunition on her lap.Then she decided she wanted to sledge down the hill. With some help from her brother she got to the top of the hill and peered down the slope. Her classmates had gathered round her wonderingshersquod really do it. She edged forward and then reached the point of no . The wheelchair slid down the slope, faster and faster. Marcela raised her hands like wings crying out ldquowheeee look at me.Then the chair slowed as it approached the bottom on the hill and wobbled to and fro. A bank of snow toppled the chair throwing Marcela out and she fell face first into the snow, arms outstretched.Her brother ran to her and helped her back into the chair. Marcelarsquos face was red with the cold and her eyes tearful. They were tears of joy and laughter.ldquoLook, she said pointing to her shape in the snow ldquoIrsquove made a snow angel!All that Christmas day, Marcela played in the snow with her brother and classmates, even making new friends.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements. Our issue is with the amount of housing proposed, which is totally inappropriate.Councillor John Williamson added: ldquoThe planned developments will technically be part of Musselburgh, although the vast majority of the new housing will be on the western side of the A with the only direct access to Musselburgh itself, as far as Irsquom aware, restricted to public transport and cycle pedestrian access.ldquoThe only full vehicle access will be via Newcraighall or Old Craighall Roundabout, which means that it will be dficult for the new communities to feel an integral part of Musselburgh.A spokesperson for QMU said: ldquoWe welcome news of the approval of planning permission for the A QMU road junction which will help unlock the full potential of the site for the development of the Innovation Park.ldquoQMU chose to move to East Lothian partly because of the opportunities to work with employers to develop the land immediately adjacent to the new campus.ldquoThe decision is the

My we and kids were with me carrying the crisps and goodies when the absence of sound coming from my friendrsquos flat made me suddenly realise Irsquod mucked up.Turning up on a doorstep with drinks and snacks for a party that had already taken place was a potentially awkward moment.ldquoI wondered where you were yesterday, my friend said, ldquoas you were so sure you were all coming.Kate, my we, who normally keeps me organised, looked at me in a way that expressed horried disbelief and lack of surprise at the same time. But what could have been an embarrassing and disappointing evening became a wonderful and quite moving experience.My friend is Jewish. She is not religious but she observes Jewish festivals and traditions as part of her inheritance and identity. And the day we arrived was December , which in  was the first day of Hanukkah, also called the lsquofestival of lightsrsquo. There is not a fixed date for this celebration as the time is based on the cycle of the moon, as many celebrations from other religious traditions are.We were askedwe would like to take part and we were honoured to do so. By tradition, the youngest in the room lights the candle, so my four-year-old son, with help, did so.The evening was full of meaning and unexpected closeness with an old friend. There was a feeling of shared sacredness in the antiquity of the ceremony, and the meaning of the story behind Hanukkah, like many religious stories, can be interpreted in dferent ways by the people who hold that faith.But at its core is the story of the miracle of the lamp that, despite only having oil enough for one night, burned for eight days and eight nights. The lamp was lit as a dedication to a desecrated temple, thereby signalling the restoration of religious freedom, and hence the name festival of lights.As we left our friendrsquos house into a cold and calm night, Kate told me she had forgiven me, as otherwise we would not have had such a meaningful and memorable evening.It happened to be also the Winter Solstice and this is a turning point in the year. Hanukkah isnrsquot specically about seasonal change but the idea of sharing the light in this dark time is a common theme.I imagined our ancestors huddling together in their ancient dwellings during the shortest day, knowing the dark was now at its worst, and soon the light would begin to . Le would come back to the land and the days become longer. But in the meantime, ways were needed to keep the dark at bay.Today we challenge the darkness with decorative seasonal lights. But we also have super-lit shopping centres, bright street lights and, hopefully, warm and lit homes.But in celebrating this time, it seems the seasonal bling of the corporate money-makers is becoming the new ritual. They promote the idea that celebrating together should be bigger and better every year that those who want to feel included need to buy the ticket for the big event.And indeed, much fun can be had at such events. But have we reached a point where traditions have become marketing labels rather than authentic shared experiences  Some people now have to acquire tickets from a company to celebrate in their own street, although thankfully not yet in East Lothian.The idea of being bigger and better means bigger crowds, which means more profit but not necessarily a better experience. Big crowds need to be restricted and controlled, meaning others are excluded. Have we reached the point whereyou donrsquot have a ticket then you canrsquot be part of the tradition We can enjoy big events while still having our own traditions, of course, but my feeling is that the idea of tradition is being hijacked by a commercial juggernaut with little authenticity or meaning other than making money.And so I think the unexpected evening with my friend taught me a lesson I hope I already knew: that the traditions we really value, and the memories we truly treasure, are the simple ones of shared meaningful connection. And perhaps the biggest treasure is sharing with those who would otherwise be excluded.And so wherever you are, whatever you do, I hope you find time to share these moments at this time of seasonal celebration. Whatever your faith or spirituality, whatever your family or cultural traditions, I wish you a Happy New Year and I look forward to theof the sun, and sharing with you new adventures of discovery in our beautul county."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbar-youngsters-thank-lifeboat-crew-saving-lives","story":"Rachel Pirie and Luke Foster, both , were exploring the townrsquos clfs with Chloe McCaw, , at about noon on November  last year when the incident happened.The rising water levels left the youngsters, who all live in Dunbar and attend Dunbar Grammar School, cut off with no food, no water and one working mobile phone that did not have any credit.Police and Coastguard crews struggled to locate them.Talking about their ordeal, Rachel said: ldquoWe know the area well and the tide was well out so we thought we were safe.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

An adult female acted as a sentry. Scanning the nearby mountain ridge for danger she was possibly distracted by her offspring, barely two months old, grazing with the herd. By the time she spotted the puma it was too late.Exploding from her hiding place the cat raced towards its prey gathering up the distance at an astonishing rate. The guanacos sprinted for their lives. When they cut right to avoid running over a clf the puma also altered course running past us aswe were invisible.A chulengostumbled. Although he got to his feet his misfortune meant he had become the principal target. A few seconds later the puma had closed the gap and sunk its retractable claws into the chulengorsquos hind quarters bringing him down. In nature some perish so others live. The chulengo would provide food for a week.Witnessing a successful hunt is such a rare event that my guide, Rex Bryngelson, an American with  years of Andes Mountains guiding experience, had only seen it once before. While the puma dragged off her prey behind some tall grass we checked our images and high-fived.Pumas are native to the mountains of both North and South America but Patagonia is reputed to be the best place to see them. The rocky surface and relative absence of people provide them with a suitable habitat to live even though, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, their numbers are in decline.I had found Rex through an advertisement in a photography magazine and he had taken care of all the arrangements including accommodation, ground transportation and most signicantly acquiring the services of Roberto Donas, an expert tracker.Roberto had driven us five hours from Punta Arenas, the southernmost city in Chile, to Estancia Laguna Amarga, a ranch catering to hikers, outdoor enthusiasts and photographers. Many of the private ranches in Patagonia participate in nature conservation. We slept in bunk beds, shared the toilets and showers and ate in a dining room which looked out at the famous towers: Torres Del Paine. Rex described it as rustic but it was more than adequate.December is summer in the southern hemisphere so the sun rose at am and gave us  hours of daylight. Each morning around .am we silently loaded our gear into Robertorsquos Mitsubishi SUV before setting off for five or six hours of puma tracking. Roberto made us coffee once we stopped and that jolted us alive. We also ate sandwiches prepared by the Estancia staff. Then it was back to the hunt for Patagoniarsquos apex predator.We ed to the ranch late morning when the pumas normally enjoy a siesta to take a brief nap ourselves. I also used the quiet time to edit photos, recharge camera batteries and make notes. The staff prepared a hot lunch before we headed out for a second photography session in the late afternoon.Of the nine sessions we experienced puma sightings during eight of them which became a source of amusement. Rex, I suppose, had been hedging his bets when, in his sales pitch, hersquod emailed me to say, ldquoWe are almost guaranteed to see pumas.From the first day onwards we were in position to get images any of which would have satisfied me before the trip. Roberto it must be said deserves the credit for our success. He has been a professional tracker for ten years and has earned the respect of his peers. ldquoI call him the Professor, one told me. ldquoHe is a satellite of information. His services are sought out by such esteemed media as National Geographic and BBC Planet Earth.Using high-powered binoculars he would search the nearby mountains looking for signs of pumas. The guanacos offered clues. If he saw them staring in one direction for an extended period of time he would look for the object of their focus. The top of the head or the flick of a tail confirmed the location of a puma. His perception was staggering. But I lost count of the number of times he pointed to a cat and said, ldquoThere, do you see it  My response was typically ldquoNo, where Two other trackers were also out in the hills. The trio communicated by VHF radio to give each otherrsquos clients the best opportunity to see the pumas. After all, the more success the better for business.ldquoIf nature is safe we will have jobs forever, Roberto explained.Each day we rotated the locations so as not to stress the pumas repeatedly. Some cats they described as shy while others were more tolerant of humans. And, when Jorge who has been compiling a catalogue of pumas in the area ndash and giving them names ndash realised we had spooked a mother and cub sitting on a hill one hundred metres away, he abruptly ended the session and we ed to our vehicles.One morning as we drove across the bumpy terrain Roberto announced we were going to look for a mother with four cubs. A normal litter is two or three. Again we hiked uphill for quite a distance and approached the location. We were in luck. The mother was lying down while her cubs played next to her.Roberto signalled for us to remain in a spot  metres away. All five pumas looked at us but since we kept our distance they relaxed. Hours passed. We watched the cubs playing while their mother slept. Then Jorge, who had wandered away from us reported on the radio, ldquoHermanita is coming! The approach of this enormous female puma caused panic among the cubs and they ran uphill away from their mother.Everyone lost sight of Hermanita until suddenly her head appeared above the mountaintop. This frightened the cubs again and they ran downhill past their mother and towards us. Because I was so focused on the impending confrontation of the two adult females I had lost track of the two cubs once they passed. Rex said, ldquoPaul, look to your left.The two cubs were sitting less than ten feet away. Remarkably, they were comfortable enough with us to seek our protection. Meanwhile, Hermanita walked around urinating and scratching the ground marking her territory. The mother rolled over on her back in a subservient position. Once Hermanita had established the hierarchy and left the scene the mother went looking for her cubs.Although it was summer the weather changed frequently. My backpack contained extra layers, a puff jacket, waterproof jacket and trousers and gloves. Many times the infamous Patagonia winds picked up and the temperature dropped substantially for a short period. At moments like these we would sit down on rocks or on the ground itself, careful to avoid the painful sting of golden barrel cactus which grows everywhere in Patagonia. The locals call it \"mother-in-law cushion. But with a view of the Torres Del Paine and other Andean monuments who could complain While the pumas were our primary objective we also encountered grey foxes, European hares and an assortment of birds native to the Andes. A few times we looked up to see Andean Condors soaring past us through the valley, their massive wingspans approaching ten feet. For the relatively short time I was in Patagonia the compilation of wildle experiences was mind blowing and I could not imagine having a better run of luck.Rex runs puma photography trips in the Autumnand spring .

He must be the most patient man alive, almost a social media saint. Watch him calmly respond to vilication and abuse every time he points out that taxes raised in Scotland could not sustain public spending, were Scotland to become independent tomorrow.Scotland has a nominal deficit of several billions of pounds which could cause immediate fiscal belt-tighteningthe Barnett taps were turned off. I say nominal because there is much controversy over Haguersquos figures.However, he won a signicant victory last year when the Scottish Government largely accepted, in the Sustainable Growth Commission, his arguments about Scotlandrsquos fiscal position, based as they are on the GERS calculations of Government spending and revenues.Nicola Sturgeon now accepts that independence will involve short-term spending restraint. Thatrsquos better than long-term decline under Westminster rule, she says. Yoursquod think that this admission would have damaged the SNPrsquos electoral standing, but the reverse is true. Last month they enjoyed another landslide victory.So herersquos the puzzle: why have Scottish voters not punished the SNP for agreeing that independence could mean, at the very least, a period of economic dislocation and public spending cuts  The Growth Commission numbers suggest that SNP promises of more cash for the NHS and social care, a costly new benefits system, compensation for Waspi women, electrication of transport and many other spending commitments would be hard to achieve.At the very least taxes would have to rise. But Scottish voters donrsquot seem particularly worried. This is because they are bothered about something more important than deficits. Brexit shows that when it comes to issues of sovereignty and identity, it isnrsquot ldquothe economy, stupid. Rarely has a political axiom been so comprehensively disproved. It clearly isnrsquot the economy that has been driving events in the UK.Looking back over the past three turbulent years, itrsquos obvious that Remainers had the best arguments. If you regard Brexit, as Hague would, as a purely economic exercise in cost-benefit analysis, it stinks. Leaving the largest and wealthiest free trade area on the planet is almost impossible to justy on narrow economic terms.There will almost certainly be a quick and dirty free trade deal negotiated in  that will remove tarfs on goods. But % of UK trade is in non-physical services. There is bound to be an increase in non-tarf barriers to British trade with the single market which will affect UK businesses. That is why so many financial companies have already been setting up shop in Dublin to operate within the rules of the EU single market.Supply chains will be disrupted, which is why car manufacturers were so opposed to Brexit. There have been problems on the high street this Christmas with the shortage of casual labour. The departure of EU citizens is likely to damage education, agriculture manufacturing and services, especially care services.Left-wing Remainers tried to claim that in some way it was billionaires who were behind Brexit, but this was never the case. Remain was, is, a thoroughly pro-capitalist, pro-business case, vigorously pursued and financed by the largest corporate interests, from car manufacturers to banks.Gina Miller is no socialist. Nor is the governor of the Bank of England, the head of Goldman Sachs, or the bosses of Jaguar Land Rover and Honda. It was a handful of pub-chain capitalists, such as Tim Martin of Wetherspoon, who backed Brexit. They are essentially English nationalists who think that Brexit is in some way a declaration of independence.Brexit, as they saw it, was about winning freedom from unelected Brussels bureaucrats and letting Britain stand strong in the world. Irsquod say thatrsquos nonsense, of course. It was never clear that membership of the single market involved a diminution of British sovereignty, even though much trade legislation had been ceded to Brussels. But economic rationality is really not the point.Brexit was essentially an argument about democracy and nationalism. As the General Election has shown, for millions of voters the economy, finance and fiscal policy had very little to do with their political priorities. Remainers were comprehensively defeated because they appeared to do down Britain and ignored the will of the people. Brexit had won the referendum, and no amount of economic reality was going to change votersrsquo minds.The Scottish Government loathes Brexit, and for very good reasons. Scots did not vote to leave the European Union for a start. But in the longer term, Brexit is very good news for the SNP. No matter what arguments unionists such as Hague deploy in future about Scotlandrsquos deficit, it will surely not determine whether or not Scotland leaves the UK.There are three immediate reasons why the Scottish deficit does not, at present, deter people from voting SNP. The Scottish Government has managed the finances of Holyrood reasonably competently over the past decade. There is great scepticism about spending arguments, which voters tend to dismiss as Project Fear.Thirdly, departure from the UK would not happen overnight, and there would be complex financial and trading negotiations before the Union was dissolved.But forget all that, because the urge for freedom trumps any argument over a few billions in tax revenues. Scottish voters know, intuitively, that Scotland is a relatively wealthy country, better off than most regions of England. Labour productivity is comparable to the UK average. Scotland has prodigious natural resources and a highly educated workforce. Scotland has the national income of Portugal and the population of Slovakia.Thatrsquos all they need to know. Indeed, were I advising the SNP, Irsquod say they should stop agonising about currency, fiscal transfers and deficits. What will defeat those arguments is not more numbers, but the emotional appeal to national identity that won Boris Johnson his election victory.Scots did not vote to leave the European Union. They did not vote to lose their EU citizenship, with all the protections that brings. They did not vote to cut EU immigration did not vote to accept trade deals with the United States did not agree to the diminution of environmental standards and did not vote to be subjected to untrammelled Tory rule from Westminster.Thatrsquos really all the SNP need to say. Voters will do the rest."},{"url":null,"title":"highland-heritage-hubs-get-cash-boost-amid-area-tourism-boom","story":"And now the future of the Strathnaver museum in Sutherland is to be secured with a pound, refurbishment which aimed at transforming it into a heritage hub for north west Sutherland.Built in , the former parish church which houses Strathnaver Museum is a category B-listed building which lies close to the popular North Coast  tourist route.Dedicated to the history of the Highland Clearances, the Museum building is itself an important piece in this story as it was from the pulpit which still dominates the main room that Rev David Mackenzie read out eviction notices to his congregation during the main Strathnaver Clearances of -.The clearances in Sutherland were particularly brutal, with tenants moved from their homes to the coast to make way for sheep. Factors would move in as soon as the crofts were empty and tear down their roofs or burn them, to prevent them from being re-occupied.In one notorious case the Sutherland Estatersquos man on the ground, Patrick Seller, was charged with culpable homicide after an old woman, who had to be carried out of her home as it was destroyed, died in the days after her eviction.Sellar, who was dismissed from his job during the trial, was acquitted of all charges. In all, around , crofters and their families were cleared from the land, with  becoming known as ldquothe year of the burnings.In  tenants and crofters from across north Sutherland met within the church to give evidence to the royal Napier Commission of Inquiry into the Condition of Crofters and Cottars in the Highlands and Islands eventually led to providing security of tenure to crofters across the crofting counties.Strathnaver Museumrsquos refurbishment project is part of a new pound million Scottish programme of projects to invest in the Highlands and Islands to provide better quality opportunities for visitors to enjoy the regionrsquos natural and cultural heritage.The Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund is led by Scottish Natural Heritage and is part funded through the European Development Fund .It is hoped the fund will encourage people to visit some of the more remote and rural areas and create and sustain jobs, businesses and services in local communities.Strathnaver Museum is a volunteer-led accredited rural history museum which explores the social history of the area of north west Sutherland, almost ,sq km known informally as Mackay Country. Situated in Bettyhill on the North Coast  Strathnaver Museum is a popular visitor attraction attracting over , visitors in .The refurbishment project will enhance the visitor experience with the creation of an annex building to the north of the church, which will explore the agricultural story of the area.Improvements to the internal layout of the church will also be carried out to open up access to the collection and create dedicated research spaces where people can study some of the records held by the museum.As well as the vital building work, Strathnaver Museum will also run a three-year community programme of activities to help share and gather knowledge about the heritage of Mackay Country. The main theme will be the Highland Clearances and explore topics such as land use, culture, migration, industry and politics.In  internal alterations saw the removal of the two galleries and the insertion of some party walls. The refurbishment plans have been drawn up by Bonar Bridge based CH Architecture and will see the removal of some of these party walls and install a bridge link which will give visitors an idea of the view from the galleries of the pulpit and lower gallery.Tommy Mackay Strathnaver Museum Chairman said ldquoWe are delighted to have been awarded funding by the Natural and Cultural Heritage Fund towards our refurbishment project. The funding will allow us to enhance the visitor experience, sustain jobs and the services we deliver and enable us to continue to promote the natural and cultural heritage of our area and the Highlands more widely.Francesca Osowska, SNH Chief Executive, added: ldquoA key priority for SNH is to help ensure tourism and other sectors benefit from, and invest in, Scotlandrsquos high quality environment.ldquoNature and culture are closely linked in the Highlands  Islands, and in many places they are central to the local economy, maintaining rural populations, jobs and skills.

One source described it as a ldquoshouting match.The process is continuing in a week that will witness two further strikes by workers in Northern Irelandrsquos crisis-hit health service.

But not because supporting indyref would leave the party worse off. It just wouldn’t be enough to tackle the big, central, yawning problem tugging away at the soul of the People’s Party north of the Border since managerialism first gripped New Labour under Tony Blair. What is Scottish Labour’s raison d’etre  What are its core beliefs  In a country where the SNP speaks the language of social democracy and Conservatives have stolen the clothes of unionism– literally what’s left The answer seems is currently a torn-looking lucky bag of assorted and often contradictory policies.For example, Scottish Labour wants a public sector bid to run the Scotrail franchise, but opposes devolving powers so Holyrood can scrap the hopeless franchising process and set up a publicly-owned Scottish railway instead. The party does wants to scrap franchising across the whole UK, except that won’t happen for another five years at least. So, what’s good for British voters , is not good for Scottish voters . Go figure. In a similar guddle, Scottish Labour voted to scrap the UK’s Trident nuclear missile system on the Clyde in , but meekly deferred to UK party policy that supports renewal in their  and  manestos. The party wants a living wage that’s a bit higher than the SNP, a Green Deal that’s a lot less radical than the Scottish Greens’ and a policy on Europe – well let’s tiptoe swtly past that mess. Yip, the absence of a coherent line on independence really is the least of Scottish Labour’s problems. Put simply, the party has no soul. No guiding star by which to steer the rough waters of political dissent. No overriding conviction or analysis to compel attention, drive direction and dictate logical positions on thorny issues like independence. Instead Scottish Labour is engaged in a very public and very naked cost benefit analysis of whether to change position on Scotland’s continuing membership of the union. No matter which way it goes, the grubby process will hardly create instant throngs of admiring converts. The truth is that Scottish Labour is stuck opposing independence for all the wrong reasons – in all circumstances, in any weather and no matter what socialist outcomes might be possible north of the Border. All because independence is the sole objective of the party that stole Labour’s birthright in  and – in the eyes of many – will never, ever be forgiven.Hating the SNP bends Scottish Labour further out of shape than any position on independence, because it defies logic, it overwhelms rival motivations , it consumes integrity and reduces politics to the boring business of automatically contradicting the SNP.Argument, to paraphrase Monty Python, is an intellectual process – a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition. Contradiction is just the automatic gainsaying of any statement the other person makes.But that’s what Scottish Labour is reduced to – automatically gainsaying the party that usurped its place, policies, heartlands and voters  years ago.This enduring grudge match fuels nonsensical soundbites like Richard Leonard’s tweet on New Year’s Day: “Johnson’s hard-right Brexit makes me fear for Scotland’s future, but it’s no reason to accept austerity in a separate Scotland as the least worst option.” Whit Or Monica Lennon’s proposal for a separate Scottish Labour party – apparently prompted by John McDonnell’s acceptance of the case for indyref last summer, when he overrode Richard Leonard. But a second vote is now what Ms Lennon wants too. So why the need for a separate party then  Unless it’s because Scotland has a distinct political culture. But accepting that means accepting quite a lot of the case for independence too.So, it’s perfectly true – aping the SNP’s pro-independence  will get Scottish Labour no further than hysterically avoiding it. Any change must be driven by some demonstrable logic – by a conviction that the important, distinctive things Scottish Labour believes in cannot now be delivered within a pan-British context. That’s the big, dficult, public debate the party must now have to create direction and win some respect.Is it worth hanging on within the union, in the vain hope that a new Labour leader can somehow win over English voters  If it isn’t, then Scottish Labour has the reason it needs to make a bold change of direction on independence. Changing tack for any less coherent reason will simply lack credibility. Independence for the sake of independence is kinda taken. Indeed, independence for the sake of dignity, equality and workers’ rights is kinda taken too. So, Scottish Labour should copy its much-reviled political nemesis in one regard only – it must find a shared transformational core belief and use it as the template around which all other policies must fit – including independence.It’s too late for a cynical rebranding exercise. The only options left for Scottish Labour are to vacate the political space they currently inhabit in favour of a new left party or to completely repurpose Scottish Labour. That could be done without reference to any other party, by revisiting the legacy of Tom Johnston – the inspiring wartime Labour Scottish Secretary whose portrait hung in Bute House during Alex Salmond’s years as First Minister. Johnston’s dislike of landed privilege was so great that all copies of his incendiary  book Our Noble Families had to be found and destroyed before he could persuade landowners to accept hydro-electric schemes on their land in the s. His instinct for a small-scale, decentralised, municipal state led him to set up a Building Society in his native Kirkintilloch so that local people’s savings could also finance council services.Johnston might have led Labour and Scotland towards the same kind of decentralised state Norway and Sweden have become,his instincts had prevailed. A modern, re-worked, vision of Johnston’s, empowered, decentralised society is practically the only unoccupied political space in Scotland. Will Scottish Labour dare to explore it or just keep grafting on policies, trying hard not to bang into the SNP, Tories or Greens along the way ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

He compares what he describes as “the dream” of cultural empowerment and “the grind” of electoral strategy, with pragmatic political gain often being a motivating factor among parties when it came to supporting devolution.The book traces the influence of magazines such as Scottish International, Radical Scotland and Edinburgh Review, as well as the fiction of William McIlvanney, James Kelman, Irvine Welsh, AL Kennedy and James Robertson.“Novels and poems are not what made the Scottish Parliament happen,” Hames said in an interview with Scotland on Sunday.“But literary culture did play an important role in re-branding devolution as a creative feat of imagination in ways that appealed to the public and flattered the political parties – who had been grinding away at ious thwarted proposals for decades.“Viewed in political and electoral terms, devolution is not a very uplting story. “Re-cast as a cultural cause and project it becomes much more stirring and vivid. “However, the resulting myth of cultural devolution tends to mask the limits, compromises and Britishness of devolution.”He continued: “By the time of the Scottish Constitutional Convention, devolution can be viewed as an elite project, supported by almost every powerful institution in Scotland. “Within that coalition, the role of writers and critics was to give a kind of cultural imprimatur to a devolutionary establishment-in-waiting. Its oppositional clout dwindled considerably, and today Scottish literary culture is fairly cosy with the aims and ethos of devolved government.”Ahead of the  referendum on Scottish independence much was made of the number of writers who publicly endorsed a Yes vote.Hames believes the unormity of opinion among artists was exaggerated, but added that many would still back independencean indyref was to take place.“I would imagine ious prominent Scottish writers will take up quite dferent positions, from radical critique to pragmatic support of the Yes prospectus, with a small number of vocal unionists,” he continued.“Whether writers on the same side, constitutionally, are willing to argue in public is another matter. “The boosterism of Scottish culture was greatly and regrettably enhanced by the first indyref, and while a counter-reaction is long overdue, the salience of Scottishness in electoral politics encourages a great deal of caution and self-censorship.”Jenner Robertson, who served as the head of PR for the Yes Scotland campaign before the  vote, said: “Artists have been a prominent part of the campaign for Scottish independence for as long as I can remember. “That intensied during the  referendum with many playing a leading role in the public campaign. “Where culture leads politics follows and I expect even more artists will campaign vocerously for Yes in indyref in a Boris and Brexit era.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp told to trial reduced working week to secure support from scottish greens","story":"The Scottish Government has been urged to consider trialling a reduced working week in parts of the public sector in its forthcoming budget as it aims to secure support from the Greens.The partys co-leader Patrick Harvie also suggested plans to dual the A and A could be scrapped, with the money instead used to provide free bus travel for young Scots. -

But away from Stormont it’s clear that the PSNI and its still relatively new Chief Constable have a lot of work to do in order to undo the damage done in what’s been a year of reversals and missteps for an organisation that appears to have lost its direction and purpose. Not to put too fine a point on it, it’s been a disaster for the PSNI vis a vis its relationship with the nationalist community. The support the new policing arrangements were given to allow devolution to forge ahead was contingent on a number of factors, most of which have either fallen by the wayside or are being flagrantly disregarded. At the most basic level, the urgent requirement for the policing service to reflect the community it serves has never been met –on the contrary, it now appears to be in reverse with calls growing for ato - recruitment. Coming two decades after the formation of the PSNI, this is desperately disappointing and places a question mark over the very concept of fair and balanced policing. But to make things immeasurably worse, the performance of Simon Byrne in the top job has led many to question the wisdom of his appointment. Any casual observation of recent history will reveal that there is no appetite within the nationalist political family for knee-jerk targeting of new PSNI Chief Constables. But when the PSNI needs to be held to account it is held to account in a robust and positive manner – the legacy issue being a recurring source of contention. But in the seven months since Mr Byrne took on the role, we’ve seen an extraordinary series of what we might charitably call unfortunate events – some cynical and deliberate acts, some common or garden incompetence – which have been incredibly debilitating to law and order in the north and which mean that the coming year is one in which his ability to see out his contract is going to be put under very serious scrutiny. First and most worrying is Mr Byrne’s increasing determination to use the PSNI as a bulwark against progress on the aforementioned legacy issue. His decision to go the Supreme Court to appeal adverse rulings on legacy investigations has seen him park the PSNI tank on the lawn of victims and survivors. His extraordinarily brutish threat to take children away from their parents quite frankly left some experienced observers here open-mouthed in astonishment. And his handling of summer bonfire issues – in particular the Avoniel and New Lodge stand-offs – underlined concerns around whether he’s possessed of the necessary insight and tactical nous to lead the PSNI forward. And to put the tin hat on an annus horribilis for policing here, Mr Byrne decided to pose for a Christmas pic with heavily armed officers at Crossmaglen barracks, to the consternation of nationalist politicians. Entirely unsurprising entirely unacceptable.

Mr Caraher had been the victim of systemic harassment by the RUC in the lead-in to the Royal Marines shooting him dead. The harassing RUC were based at Crossmaglen Barracks. Sited beside Crossmaglen Rangers GAA club, RUC officers and British army soldiers had to be flown in via helicopter in military operations. All while the people who actually lived in the place trained, played and socialised in the GAA grounds on its doorstep. It was a physical epitome of occupation. Social media at Christmas is usually the pretty standard fare of hope and goodwill to all. Sadly, the PSNI’s Chief Constable social media was a wholly dferent offering, echoing Christmases Past in South Armagh. His pictures came from Crossmaglen , a strange choice of venue given the PSNI barracks in Crossmaglen has transformed from the days of conflict and is only open a few hours a week. Tuesday and Thursday from am-pm and on a Saturday from pm-pm. Not Wednesdays, not Christmas Day . But it was not the out-of-hours visit that caused people to stop in their tracks. It was the picture of Mr Byrne with four of his colleagues, two of them posing with heavy-duty rles. It was reminiscent of the heavy, dark days of conflict when the RUC would stand posing in their militarised version of disgraced policing. And all of the resulting echoes of the RUC, militarisation, shoot-to-kill and disgrace evoked by those photographs were heard loud and clear on Christmas Day as we read the tweet in disbelief. The response was unanimous from the population of Crossmaglen and the politicians that represent it: that it was ill-judged at best, and in no way reflected the contextual reality for modern policing. The wider response from commentators, journalists and others on social media was equally swt. This was an unwarranted, unhelpful and bizarre tweet and another misstep from a tone-deaf Chief Constable. This was in further evidence on St Stephen’s Day when he refused to withdraw the tweet and issued a statement justying the display of heavy weaponry as reflecting the terrorist threat his officers operate with. Presumably on Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday evenings. It insulted the intelligence of anyone with half a genuine concern. His response displays the signs of a a weak man trying to act hard and when called out refuses to accept responsibility and blames the “bad boys”. The six counties have never had acceptable policing. Policing has always operated at dferent stages of history to reinforce British occupation: the Protestant State for a Protestant People since partition British military policy during the conflict and extremely sinister policies of shoot to kill and collusion. The PSNI is meant to be the new beginning we deserve and need. Human rights-compliant, accountable, community-based, responsive and supported policing that meets our needs as a community in its entirety. Many of us have tried to make that potential a reality. This Chief Constable doesn’t get it and, most worryingly of all, he appears to be too arrogant in his approach to learn. If policing was in crisis under George Hamilton for its defence of the RUC, which it was, then things have worsened under the clueless Mr Byrne."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind.

One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"forget bridge tunnel best way to link northern ireland and great britain say experts","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Instead, they favour the construction of a tunnel under the Irish Sea. In fact, the plan is for two tunnels - one from England to the Isle of Man, and a second from the Isle of Man to Co Down.They say their proposal would be better than a bridge, as a rail tunnel would not be at the mercy of bad weather, and would avoid the problems in spanning Beaufort Dyke, a deep sea trench in the North Channel containing a million tonnes of dumped wartime munitions.The plan is part of a broader list of tunnel projects put forward by the society. They include a tunnel from Hampshire to the Isle of Wight, another under the Bristol Channel between the West Country and Wales, and a new tunnel under the Thames.Bill Grose, lead author of the ICE report, told the Sunday Times: \"A tunnel starting north of Liverpool that surfaced in the Isle of Man and then went back under to reach Belfast would solve all the problems\" he said.\"Tunnels are less prone to bad weather, and construction is getting faster and cheaper every year.\"The distance from England to the Isle of Man is around  miles, and from the Isle of Man to Northern Ireland is just over  miles.Mr Grose, a former chairman of the British Tunnelling Society, added: \"As prices continue to fall, tunnels will become increasingly attractive as a way of connecting the United Kingdom.\"It cost about £m per kilometre for a twin rail tunnel, but costs are falling. When we reduce them by another %, tunnelling will become popular and very long tunnels become feasible.\"Tunnels and bridges cost much the same - but tunnels are not prone to bad weather.\"The ambitious proposals are surfacing as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is known to be interested in major construction projects to unite the UK in the post-Brexit era.In September last year it was learned that Mr Johnson had asked Government officials for advice on the costs and risks of building a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.Initial estimates put the cost at around £bn.

The east Belfast UVF admitted its members carried out the murder but said it was not sanctioned by its leadership. Graffiti near the Beersbridge Road in east Belfast labels Ian’s daughter Toni as a “Sunday Le tout” for doing a recent interview with the Belfast ’s sister paper Sunday Le.Margaret, who is  and lives in Holywood, said it has been terrible for the family to celebrate Christmas, birthdays, anniversaries and births without Ian, who was known as ‘Big O’ to his close friends. The family have also had to endure cruel taunts on social media and on the streets of Belfast about Ian’s murder.“I am upset, becausethey have anything to say, come straight to us,” Margaret said. “Don’t write bad things on the wall, they are just graffiti cowards. If they think they are going to lower us to their level, they won’t. We will be strong and we will all stand together because we want our day in court.

But why somebody, coming up to the year anniversary, is writing silly things on the wall like children.

We will be shoulder to shoulder and we will have our day in court.”Margaret said she was proud of how her family have stood up to intimidation since Ian’s death.“I love my family, I would never change my family. I thank Vera for giving my son love and two beautul children, Toni and Ryan. As our Ryan would say “unbowed and unbroken”, they can write what they want but they can’t change the love we have for that boy and they will never take the respect that everybody had for him.”Margaret said Ian was a “noisey big hearted giant” and that the family could not celebrate his sister Christina’s th birthday because of their sorrow over his death. Speaking directly to those behind the graffiti, Margaret said: “Stop being cowards, stop trying to belittle the death of a beautul person and stop making us sadder than we have to be.” data-dfpadtargetingIan OgleChristina McMaster, Ian’s sister who is also speaking for the first time, said the past year has been a nightmare.“It has been awful. Every day is like living the same day. Part of you thinks it is going to end, but it isn’t. There is no end to it,\" she said.Addressing the graffiti, she said: “I don’t see the point in it, they are not getting anywhere with it. They are just causing more hurt and upset. There is no need for it. Stop, you are not getting yourself anywhere. We are not going to go away, we are still going to fight for justice for my brother. He was a brilliant person and there is no need to carry on like that.”Toni Ogle, Ian’s daughter, told the Belfastthat she believes the east Belfast UVF are behind the graffiti. “It’s been frustrating because we are trying to come to terms with the fact that it has been almost a year since my daddy was murdered,” she said.“We are upset about that and we are upset because we have not been allowed to grieve because we are still getting tortured.”Toni says the intimidation has become a fact of le for her family. “It has been going on since soon after the murder. A couple of weeks after my daddy was buried someone threatened to kill my brother and that is when the threats started, and to be honest it hasn’t stopped.“It is really stressing my mum out . She is trying to deal with the fact that her le partner has gone. She is getting upset for us because she can’t understand how anyone can disrespect kids that have been through what we have been through.“They are just motivating us and the family are more defiant than ever to keep going.”Ian was stabbed to death at the front door of his house in Cluan Place as he prayed with local pastor Kevin Sambrook. Earlier that evening he had been involved in a clash with UVF members on the Beersbridge Road. The gang responded by sending five men armed with knives and bats to his door.

One source described it as a “shouting match”.The process is continuing in a week that will witness two further strikes by workers in Northern Ireland’s crisis-hit health service.We dont need dramatics, we dont need grandstanding - what we need is political will to get an agreementConor Murphy, Sinn FeinParties are at odds over proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers and reform of a contentious Stormont veto mechanism called the petition of concern.Politicians are also trying to agree changes to Assembly rule to make it less susceptible to implosion in the future.The UK and Irish governments are anticipated to table the outline of a deal later this week, and urge the five main parties to sign up to it.Mr Murphy rejected the suggestion that giving politicians more time would make a dference.“We have been at this for three years, when is enough time enough time ” he said.“We don’t need dramatics, we don’t need grandstanding – what we need is political will to get an agreement.“The issues have been rehearsed and well-rehearsed for a long time now.”Mr Murphy also moved to downplay the signicance of the apparent bad-tempered exchanges during the leaders’ meeting.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Sinn Fein’s Conor Murphy and Gerry Kelly at Stormont “You get good days and days when people are a little more tetchy, I wouldn’t get overly worried about it,” he said.“What’s important is what comes out at the end of this process, not about what happens at every junction throughout it.”If a deal is not reached by the January  deadline, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Ireland’s struggling public services expires and Mr Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap poll.Sinn Fein was the only one of the five main Stormont parties to hold a press conference on the state of the talks on Monday.Mr Murphy again singled out the DUP as the party he claimed was holding up progress.Earlier, Traditional Unionist Voiceleader Jim Allister, who is not involved in the talks, said there was absolutely no need, requirement or justication for an Irish language act.He claimed the sector was already “over-feted”, pointing to the education of children in Irish.He said: “It wants more, more, more. Why “Because the whole agenda of an Irish language act has nothing to do with linguistics, it has everything to do with politics, and the politics of a weaponised demand for an Irish language act is about de-Britishising Northern Ireland, making it a more uncomfortable place for unionists in their own land.“I am very clear, therefore, no unionist should be conceding anything in that regard.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/4f016/38822178.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/e%20Teenage%20victims.jpg","title":"the headlines of 2019 a year of roller coaster highs","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Former Chief Constable George Hamilton, who had described the officers as \"brave\", later apologised to the families of the teenagers.March: Soldier F is chargedIn March, a former Paratrooper was told he will face murder charges over the killing of two people on Bloody Sunday in Londonderry in .The Public Prosecution Service said there was enough evidence to prosecute Soldier F for the murders of James Wray and William McKinney.William McKinneyThe sole prosecution was seen as a \"terrible disappointment\" by some of the families of the  people killed at a civil rights march on  January, .The day became known as Bloody Sunday - one of the darkest days of the Troubles.Soldier F also faces charges for the attempted murders of Patrick ODonnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn.The Public Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute  other soldiers and two Official IRA men.James Wrays brother Liam said he was \"very saddened for the other families\" of those killed on Bloody Sunday.\"Their hearts must be broken,\" he said.\"It has been a sad day but the Wray family are relieved.\"Linda Nash, whose brother William was shot dead, said she felt \"let down by a law and a justice system thats supposed to protect people\".But the news led to a loyalist campaign of support for Soldier F, with banners erected across Northern Ireland over what some saw as the unfair victimisation of former British soldiers who served here.April: Lyra McKee is shot dead by dissidentsJournalist Lyra McKeewas fatally shot in the head while observing rioting in Londonderrys Creggan estate in April. The New IRA later admitted carrying out the murder.Massive public outcry followed her death, with former prime minister Theresa May, Irish president Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar among those to attend her funeral at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast.Lyra McKeeThere was a standing ovation, and loud applause erupted, at her funeral service when priest Fr Martin Magill openly challenged the politicians in the pews over the ongoing Stormont stalemate. \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman to get to this point \" he asked.In the days after the murder a protest by friends of Ms McKee took place outside the Londonderry offices of dissident republican political group Saoradh, which has been linked to the New IRA.A number of protesters smeared red handprints on republican slogans outside the office, and they quickly became a symbol for peace across the country.A strong LGBTQ activist, Belfast born Lyra had moved to Derry to be with her partner, Sara Canning, shortly before her death.Her book, Angels with Blue Faces, which deals with the  IRA murder of Belfast MP Robert Bradford, was published several months after her death.June: Boris tackles BrexitAway from the ongoing political turmoil as Stormont remained closed for business, the main topic in the political arena was Brexit.After several failed attempts to get her Brexit deal for the UK to leave the European Union through Parliament, Theresa May announced she would be standing down as Prime Minister on May .Mrs May was finally replaced by Boris Johnston after leaving office on June .After ing to the EU, Mr Johnson came back with a new deal, but several more failed attempts to find a route through parliament finally led to a General Election on December .Boris JohnsonBrexit brought particular concerns for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK with an EU land border, and debate raged over the frontier. Business leaders said no-deal would have proved disastrous. The farming community was facing devastation with the loss of EU subsidies coupled with new trade tarfs between north and south. Experts warned that farmers would be left facing bankruptcy.A real issue for all was the lack of clarity about what any potential Brexit would mean for Northern Ireland. Everyone had an opinion on what Brexit would mean. When Mr Johnson ed with his new deal from the EU, it became known as the Betrayal Act by loyalists who saw it as a threat to the Union. They claimed it put an economic border in the Irish Sea and meant Northern Ireland would be treated dferently to the rest of the UK.Disagreements about what it all means for Northern Ireland will continue in the next  months.July: Lowry wins at PortrushJuly saw the worlds best golfers and thousands of golf fans flock to the north coast as Royal Portrush hosted The Open for the first time in almost  years.The championship generated more than £ million of economic benefit for Northern Ireland, according to a study commissioned by organisers and proved a real boost to the tourist industry with hotels sold out and fans flocking to the scenic location from across the world - , fans arrived on the north coast with more than half coming from outside Northern Ireland.Shane LowryThe figures helped boost predictions that  will be a record breaking year for tourism in Northern Ireland with .m people expecting to have visited in the year.Irish winner Shane Lowry lted the coveted Claret Jug at the end of the event, six shots clear of nearest challenger, Englands Tommy Fleetwood.

The biggest loser was the DUP, with Nigel Dodds ousted by Sinn Feins John Finucane after serving as North Belfast MP for  years. The DUP also lost South Belfast where the SDLPs Claire Hanna unseated Emma Little-Pengelly by over , votes. The DUP suffered a third blow in North Down where the Alliance Partys Stephen Farry claimed the seat vacated by independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon.Nigel DoddsWhile the DUP finished the election down from  seats to eight, Sinn Fein saw their majorities slashed across Northern Ireland - Mr Finucanes win tempered by a crushing defeat for Elisha McCallion in Foyle.

of  in terms of our business planning assumption.“Clearly both the chief executive of Crossrail, in my regular discussions with him, the chair and the board of Crossrail, know the imperative of bringing that date as forward as they can possibly and safely do so, because of the imperative of getting the revenue to flow into TfL overall.“The assumption we’ve made is, I suppose, at the

He said issues that were being consistently raised included the availability of ambulances and a dearth of staff working in health clinics and hospitals.“Traditionally, at this time of year the demand on health services starts to build, but what is dferent this time is that we have seen an increase in the number of constituents who are coming to us over hospital admissions.“People waiting for surgery, for a consultant appointment- I even had someone with me recently waiting on cancer treatment.“There is no doubt about it, the health system is under pressure, both locally and further afield. It is a resource issue- we need more staff, more consultants, more doctors and more nurses. Those working in our health care system are left coping with the huge demand and are feeling the pressure.

An online petition launched by Carrick McClean has now been signed over , times, which isnt far off its , target. The latest person to publicly support the petition isTheoretical Astrophysicist, Peter Coles. He is a professor in, and Head of, the Department of Theoretical Physics at Maynooth University in Ireland, who carries out research is in the area of cosmology and the large-scale structure of the Universe. The Beard Liberation Front, the informal network of beard wearers, has also rallied behind Carrick. The group says, the pogonophobic rules of the school do not allow students to have a beard. googletag.cmd.push BLF Organiser Keith Flett said, this is not the s and we fully support Mr McClean. There is a petition that can be signed and we expect a change of mind by the school. However, other members of the public have backed the school, saying its clean shaven policy is right. Mr McCleans petition reads as follows: As a young adult I work , drive , pay tax and national insurance , and I am registered to vote. But whenever I enter the school I am treated like a child , being forced to be clean shaven. As the school website states The aim of St Columbs is to enable its pupils to realise their full moral, social, intellectual, physical and aesthetic potential. I see this policy as limiting me in my potential to be myself and by being placed in the study for my choice of growing a beard has the possibility in limiting my achievement academically as I cannot attend my classes. googletag.cmd.push The amount of pressure on pupils at the minute is astronomical, from getting the best grades , meeting deadlines and a range of other factors school can play a huge affect on someone’s mental healthBy giving pupils the freedom to have facial hairthey desire I believe we would be much happier in our learning environment which is paramount to a more fulfilling educational experience. As a socialist and believer in equality I hope that  will be a year of signicant change for the better , and I aspire that St.Columbs College will be apart of this , allowing me and my fellow pupils to be ourselves. https:www.change.org p principal-abolish-st-columb-s-college-clean-shaven-policy recruiterutm_sourceshare_petitionutm_mediumfacebookutm_campaignshare_petitionrecruited_by_ida-e-ea-c-abbcutm_contentstarter_fb_share_content_en-gb%Av   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its no surprise he has flamed the potential of yet another very destructive US regional war in the Middle East. googletag.cmd.push But he also faces tremendous resistance from trade unions, from women and a great cross section of ordinary people in the US. There will be widespread opposition to his designs for war on Iran. Thousands have already taken to the streets in protest.

Ebenezer Scrooge wasnt the first fictional character to see ghosts at this time of year. In fact the tradition probably goes back further than Christmas itself. As the nights grow long and the year creeps towards its close its a natural instinct that people gather together. Its also natural that this time makes us think of people and places that are no longer here. These thoughts have often morphed into tales based on what we encounter at this time of year - winter, death and the eventual rebirth experienced in spring. googletag.cmd.push In Europe this was usually connected to the pagan rituals surrounding the winter solstice known as Yule. The shortest and darkest day of the year was viewed as a time when the dead would have access to the living. The telling of tales at Yuletide began to decline as TV took over as the main form of household entertainment, but it must also be remembered that when Dickens published A Christmas Carol in  the tradition of Christmas itself was also in decline. In fact, for most people in that era Christmas was a working day because the Industrial Revolution meant fewer days off for everyone. As a result, Christmas was considered relatively unimportant and no one really complained. googletag.cmd.push The beginning of disregarding Christmas had come courtesy of Oliver Cromwell around  years earlier. The puritanical Lord Protector of England who in the th Century was “on a mission to cleanse the nation of its most decadent excesses.” These excesses unfortunately included banning Christmas celebrations, its ghostly tales and traditions with even carols making his draconian hit list. Oliver Cromwell is of course remembered in Ireland for his other exploits including the deaths of thousands of people as the result of his orders. But despite his best efforts he failed to quell the traditions of folklore carried over from pre-Christian Ireland. In the Irish tradition, ghosts are called taidhbhse or tais and live in a place halfway between this le and the next. The spirits are held here by some earthly affection or unfulfilled duty or anger against the living. Those who die suddenly, more commonly than others, are believed to become haunting Ghosts. They go about moving the furniture, and in every way trying to attract attention. It was also believed that when the soul has left the body, it is drawn away, sometimes, by the fairies. Such souls are considered lost. If a soul eludes the fairies, it may be snapped up by the evil spirits. The weak souls of young children were especially in danger. In western Ireland for example, people sprinkled the threshold with the blood of a chicken when a very young child died so that the spirits may be drawn away to the blood. A ghost was also compelled to obey the commands of the living. One old tale said, the stable-boy up met the master going round the yards after he had been two days dead, and told him to be away with him to the lighthouse, and haunt that and there he is far out to sea still. Oscar Wildes mother who studied and wrote about the supernatural thought it was only spirits who were too bad for heaven, and too good for hell, who were caught halfway between paradise and damnation. It was also thought that the souls of the dead sometimes took the shapes of animals. They will sometimes take the forms of insects, especially butterflies. If you see one fluttering near a corpse, that is the soul, and is a sign of its having entered upon immortal happiness. The author of the Parochial Survey of Ireland, , heard a woman say to a child who was chasing a butterfly, How do you know it is not the soul of your grandfather. Spirits who remain inside houses can also take on many shapes, including that of the elf and sometimes also of a rat, cat, or black dog. In their natural state they are invisible to people, but they can become visible in these forms. They make a lot of noise in the house at night and live between the walls, in the attic or in the cellar, in the stable, in the shed, sometimes even in a large tree beside the house. These ghosts are not considered particularly intelligent, and remain friendly as long as they are treated well. They like to tease lazy people by pulling the blankets off their beds and sending icy drafts through the room. They also delight in knocking over milk pails and keeping people awake by constantly tapping on the walls. When made very angry, they become malevolent. Their noise making becomes unbearable they throw stones, the cattle become sick, drought or cold weather or continuous storms occur. They leave the house or farm only when it has been totally overwhelmed by disaster and is lost. And, there is a well-known local wintry ghostly tale which refers to The Lady in the Snow which is said to have happened on the outskirts of Derry. The story is of two children, a brother and sister who were playing in the snow near a small stream near Enagh Lough. They were making a snowman and gradually they moved closer and closer to the water until they were standing on the ice. A woman dressed in a grey coat and a fur muff approached them, warning them of the danger. She coaxed them back to the bank just as the ice began to crack. She asked where they lived and she advised them to go home. The little girl askedshe could walk home with them andshe could put her hands in the muff to make them warm. The woman put the muff on the little girl and they chatted as they walked. She told them that she had a little girl who went into the water through the ice and warned them to be careful. At the gate she took her muff back and watched them being greeted at the door by their mother. They were both pointing at the lady and gesticulating but the mother saw no one. However she went to the gate because the children were so convinced that a lady had walked home with them. On the snow there were only the footprints of her children. When the snow melted a muff was found near the lake. The little girl knew it was the one that the lady wore.

For decade upon decade, especially in rural Ireland, New Years Eve was about exactly that - staying in. New Year was never truly a big thing in Ireland - especially for farming communities for who the fortunes of the crops were all important. Irish New Year traditions in agricultural areas, such as they are, are all about the coming twelve months. One belief was that no water could be drawn from the well after the sun went down on New Years Eve. All the water required needed to be inside the house before that and none of it could leave the house until the next day. Defying this belief meant that the family would be faced with a drought in the new year. googletag.cmd.push There was also a tradition that no money could be spent on New Years Day. Nothing could be brought out of a home and anyone visiting should make sure they came bearing a gt. Giving something away meant giving your money away and surely no sensible person would do that. The stroke of midnight on December  carried traditions of its own. Being the first visitor to a house on New Years Day was a popular custom but the warmth of your welcome was largely dependent on the colour of your hair. Unless he arrived empty handed, a dark haired man would be greeted gladly because it was believed that he would bring plenty of good luck. However, a red headed womans arrival meant ill fortune evenher arms were weighed down with all the tokens of what was known as first footing - bread and coal. Red haired females apparently tended to stay at home on New Years Eve. googletag.cmd.push In fact to prevent bad luck, families sometimes sent out a dark haired member of the family immediately after midnight and had them walk back in though the door. All dark haired boys in the area would visit the houses and be welcomed with gts of sweets or money. Anything bad that happened on New Years Eve was considered more signicant the closer it was to midnight. It was believed that there was only a certain amount of luck in the world and everything that could be done to claim a share of it had to be done. It was also important to begin the New Year with a spotlessly clean house signying a fresh start to the New Year. New Years Eve was also known as “Oiacuteche na Coda Moacuteire,”- ‘the night of the big portion’ since people would eat a larger than normal meal to ensure food in plenty for the coming year. Another way of ensuring plenty was to make a cake which was then pounded against the door of the house three times while a prayer was said by the housewe. This would chase the bad luck out of the house and invite the good spirits in. In other areas the man of the house would take three bites out of the cake and then throw it against the front door, in the name of the Trinity and banish hunger from the house. After this the family would then gather up the fragments of the cake and eat it. Many farmers repeated this ceremony at the door of the byre to ensure plentul fodder for the cows. People tried to ensure that no food was taken away from the house on New Years Eve and beggars knew better than to approach a house looking for food. Another New Years Eve Irish tradition was that young girls put mistletoe under their pillows on New Year’s Eve, in hopes of dreaming about their future husband. On New Year’s Eve night, families would remember those who has passed away that year before by setting a place for them at the dinner table and leaving the door unlatched. Anyone entering the house after midnight by the front door would leave by the back door for good luck. Well into the evening on New Years Eve in Ireland there would always be a small group gathered around the fireplace, laughing and joking. Sooner or later, the conversation would turn to reminiscing about Ireland. The old ones, well on their way with a few glasses of the hard stuff, would get all misty-eyed as they remembered times past and the stories would begin in the light of just the fire and candles burning in the windowsill. There was also an Irish tradition of predicting the political future of the country by checking which way the wind blows at midnight on New Year’s Eve. If the wind is from the west, there is a chance that good fortune will reign that year. If the wind is from the east, however, the British will prevail. And,after the stroke of midnight the man of the house would recite the following verse: “May your nets always be full, Your pockets never empty, Your horse not cast a shoe, Nor the devil look at you In the coming year.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A video introducing Brooke Scullion revealed that she works in a petting zoo but is allergic to animals - its okayI just dont breathe in, she joked. She was joined by her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila. They described her as a very lively and bubbly wee girl adding singing is her dream. Before taking to the stage Brooke said: Theres nothing  in the world that gives me the feeling that performing does. To go through would be amazing. This is the biggest opportunity that Ive ever had. googletag.cmd.push The -year-olds version of Lewis Capaldis Bruises prompted Will.I.Am and Meghan Trainor to turn instantly. They were quickly followed by Olly Murs and Tom Jones. As the performance unfolded Sir Toms eyes were visibly bulging as he digested her vocal range.   Each of the judges implored the -year-old to join their team. Will.I.Am told her he had to turn after three words, Meghan said she was obsessed already and believes Brooke can be a superstar. Tom added that her voice is tremendous, shes wonderful and Olly lauded her as fantastic. After telling Tom Jones that both of her grannies were single and Olly Murs that one of them fancied a toy boy, Brooke eventually settled on American singer songwriter Meghan Trainor. googletag.cmd.push Meghan said she felt the competition was won already so impressed was she with Brookes talent. Each coach needs  acts for the next stages - the battle rounds - and will be seen fighting over the best acts. As always, the coaches had their backs to the stage so they can only base their decision to pick an act on the voice alone. Each of the contestants who step out on stage must hold their nerve as they perform in the hope of seeing at least one chair spins round. Butno coaches turn then the contestant leaves the stage immediately as the coaches remain with their backs to the stage, never seeing who performed. After the auditions comes the Battles where the Coaches reduce their teams by half but, with the opportunity to steal one act each from another coach, they will take six through per team to the Knockouts. If Brooke successfully negotiates the Knockouts she will earn a place in the live shows where the public will ultimately crown the winner of The Voice .

A video introducing Brooke Scullion revealed that she works in a petting zoo but is allergic to animals - its okayI just dont breathe in, she joked. She was joined by her two biggest fans, grannies Peggy and Sheila. They described her as a very lively and bubbly wee girl adding singing is her dream. Before taking to the stage Brooke said: Theres nothing  in the world that gives me the feeling that performing does. To go through would be amazing. This is the biggest opportunity that Ive ever had. googletag.cmd.push The -year-olds version of Lewis Capaldis Bruises prompted Will.I.Am and Meghan Trainor to turn instantly. They were quickly followed by Olly Murs and Tom Jones. As the performance unfolded Sir Toms eyes were visibly bulging as he digested her vocal range.   Each of the judges implored the -year-old to join their team. Will.I.Am told her he had to turn after three words, Meghan said she was obsessed already and believes Brooke can be a superstar. Tom added that her voice is tremendous, shes wonderful and Olly lauded her as fantastic. After telling Tom Jones that both of her grannies were single and Olly Murs that one of them fancied a toy boy, Brooke eventually settled on American singer songwriter Meghan Trainor. googletag.cmd.push Meghan said she felt the competition was won already so impressed was she with Brookes talent. Each coach needs  acts for the next stages - the battle rounds - and will be seen fighting over the best acts. As always, the coaches had their backs to the stage so they can only base their decision to pick an act on the voice alone. Each of the contestants who step out on stage must hold their nerve as they perform in the hope of seeing at least one chair spins round. Butno coaches turn then the contestant leaves the stage immediately as the coaches remain with their backs to the stage, never seeing who performed. After the auditions comes the Battles where the Coaches reduce their teams by half but, with the opportunity to steal one act each from another coach, they will take six through per team to the Knockouts. If Brooke successfully negotiates the Knockouts she will earn a place in the live shows where the public will ultimately crown the winner of The Voice .

Waterworth promptly stepped up and fired Linfield into the lead.That lead was doubled within minutes as Stute caved in completely. Brogans initial effort was tipped over by Brown, but from the corner, Waterworth flicked on and Haughey turned the bal home from close range to make it -. It should have been - by the half time break, but again Brown came to the rescue, denying Cooper who should ahve scored, but regardless, Linfield were comfortable at the break, whilst Stute had a huge mountain to climb. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The chances just kept coming for Linfield as Lavery broke clear on goal but with just Brown to beat he shot wide. Stute then had the woodwork to thank for keeping the score down as Millars delivery was met by Haughey but his weffort bounced back off the post into Browns arms.There was little sign of any come back from Stute and the chances con tinued to come for the home side who were proving wasteful in front of goal, as Waterworth went one on one with Brown only for the Stute goalkeeper to come out on top again. The third goal eventually did come and the superb Cooper created it as he raced away from his marker before cutting the ball back to substitute Jordan Stewart, whose close range strike was outstandingly kept out by Brown, but Lavery was on hand to turn home the loose ball in from close range. Institute take a break from league action when they host Dungannon Swts at the Brandywell in the Irish Cup this weekend. The teams palayed out an entertaining - draw when Swts lasted visited Stute last month.

His close friends and running colleagues tried every trick in the book to ascertain the route for the annual Castlewellan Christmas Cracker, but uncharacteristically lsquoThe Prophetrsquo remained tight-lipped and taciturn. The usual platitudes and prosaicisms were thrown out by way of appeasement, but they threw no light on the course that has been in the planning since January .Phrases like, lsquothere is something for everyonersquo, lsquothere will be a few good climbsrsquo, lsquowe will go through a field or tworsquo and lsquoI still have a few ditches to clearrsquo served only to add intrigue and mystique to the potential route.From am, parking spaces were snaffled up as the growing crowds made their way to collect their numbers, totally unaware of what lay ahead, another unique characteristic of this now iconic event.When we go to races we usually know what lies ahead as it will be the same as the previous year mdash not so with this one.This led to great speculation at registration and the passing of spurious rumours, lsquoIrsquove heard it is Foxes green firstrsquo, lsquoBunkerrsquos Hill is the first climbrsquo, lsquothe gates at Niall Kingrsquos place are open and that can only mean one thing!rsquoThose unwise enough to listen were tormented, while the more sanguine took it all in their stride realising that what would be would be.The atmosphere in the GAA club was electric and filled with excitement as every little corner became a changing space and in the middle of all of this Stevie Rice had set up a stall and had created a monopoly on udderrmint ndash an essential for the discerning runner.With space at a premium, one team had pre-booked the VIP changing facilities in Ned McCartanrsquos front room. Here the gracious, ebullient and effervescent host provided valet parking, bespoke carb-rich pre-race food, handed out warm fluffy towels and proffered words of wisdom and encouragement. The * package was completed with optional dog therapy ndash petting Socks.The  entries were snapped up in a few weeks, such is the popularity of this event among the NI running fraternity.Running in pairs is far from commonplace in what is largely an inidual sport and this certainly brings a welcome new dimension in that you are only as good as your partner and an ill-conceived or sentimental choice could see you standing waiting at the top of a hill, the bottom of a hill or at the finish.The secret lies in getting the right partner, one you know you can work with and whose running skills complement your own ndash a lesson that has still to be learned by a number of this yearrsquos participants.While the event is a great opportunity to dress up, socialise and enjoy the wonderful scenery that Castlewellan has to offer, the racing at the sharp end of the field is seriously fierce.From the moment they were set on their way at the bottom of the Circular Road, the cream rose to the top as the leading teams thundered their way through the town at breakneck speed.Getting good road position at the front is essential for the leading men and women.In , Newcastlersquos Lynch and Hanna were clear winners with a minute and a half to spare over Johnston and Scott of Mourne Runners, with McMullan and Stephens, from the host club, a further  seconds back in third.These three teams were paired once again, but had to settle for second, third and fth respectively. With Hanna in the form of his le and regularly representing Ireland in the hills and Lynch coming off a superb  minute k at the Seeley, they were the in-form team and pre-race favourites.However, favourites do not always win and on this occasion it was Aaron McGrady from East Down and his partner Andrew Barrington, originally from Oban in Scotlandwho emerged victorious.The pair, who run and race together for Victoria Park Harriers in London, were among a group of leaders along the Crow Road.As the course rose steeply after the Moorish Tower, the pair was second behind Lynch and Hanna as they hurtled through the fields towards the Bannanstown Road.As was the case in , the climb over the Playrock Hill would prove decisive and the eventual winners managed to pull away and open a winning lead.However, McGrady admits that once they hit the front, they had to work very hard over the last three miles as they knew the quality of the team chasing them.When asked about the course, the winner said that it was very dferent to previous years, was far less muddy than anticipated and despite the steep hills offered great opportunities for hard fast running.Overall, he considered it to be a well-planned and carefully balanced route. McKinstry was always in contention, but his partner suffered terribly and put paid to their chances of the win ndash they would finish fourth overall.Beechmount Harriers claimed the ladiesrsquo team prize with Sarah Laverty and Catherine Diver finishing in an excellent th place overall ndash all that training up the hill in Falls Park paid off.They were joined on the podium by Hannah Somani and Georgina Wileyand Amanda Perry and Denise Logue .In the mixed category there was a great win for Shalene McMurray and David McNeilly who were th overall and comfortably clear of their nearest challengers and club mates Mari Troeng and Frank Cunningham. Karen Wilton and Andrew Wills of Jog Lisburn completed the mixed team podium.There were male, female and mixed category winners dotted throughout the field and these are highlighted in the results file available on the Newcastle AC website . Well done to everyone who won a prize.Some of the fancy dress was simply amazing and added greatly to the sense of fun that is central to this race. Special mention to the Power family who once again dressed to impress and the three sheep bleated their way around the course under the ever-watchful eye of Bo Peep, the Newry AC crew who were came as the cast of lsquoIrsquom a Celebrityrsquo, but regrettably failed to get out of there and had to complete all nine miles and the Grant family and their friends who looked lsquoCrackingrsquo for the Cracker.Costumes came in all shapes and sizes with superheroes galore and even the odd beach ball shoved up a T-shirt for maximum effect.Before we draw the curtain on this event there are some necessary closing remarks.Firstly, we have to mention some of those who were lsquopale facedrsquo as they crossed the finish line.Among this number were Connaire McVeigh, his brother Brian McVeigh, Noel lsquoWonderwallrsquo Gallagher , Dee Murrayand Patrick Higgins who it would seem invented a new shade of grey.While all of these are notable and honourable mentions, there can only be on winner of such a prestigious accolade.The worthy recipient is none other than Dominic lsquoMad Dogrsquo McGreevy, who by his own admission was lsquoclean burstedrsquo by evergreen Jim Brown before they even left the show field.Whilst cogitating the next day with McVeigh, he noted that there was a distinct lack of climbing in the opening mile which considerably reduced his chances of the overall win.Of course, all of this is pure conjecture, passed on to me by others who were better placed to judge. As these pale faced warriors finished, I was probably getting a drink at Stephen McMullanrsquos pop-up tavern in Leitrim.The day was a great success due to the hard work and planning that took place. Course designer McCrickard would like to thank his incredible team that spent the best park of two days marking ndash Francie McAlinden, Audey McVeigh , Aidan Brownand Donal Ward.Thanks also to the entry management and registration team who did so much work in creating and continually updating and modying the team ndash no small task, the marshals from our own club and neighbouring clubs, the lead cyclists from Shimna Wheelers and Kilmegan CC, the motorbike riders, Robert and Paddy, the finish team and the presentation party ndash too many to name inidually, but you all know who you are.In conclusion, the feedback from the , that completed the course was amazingly positive and a great time was had by all.

Health unions agreed a .% three-year pay rise for NHS staff, excluding doctors, in  but the deal did not apply to Northern Northern because of the absence of devolved government.Nurses based at the Downpatrick hospitals were among an estimated , from the Royal College who went on strike for the first time in the unionrsquos -year history the week before Christmas.The one-day stoppage marked a serious escalation after weeks of industrial action by other healthcareworkers. RCN nurses were joined by their Unison colleagues on the picket line in poor weather, buffeted by wind and rain.Northern Ireland has the worst hospital waiting lists in the UK, according to figures from the Department of Health with some , people waiting for appointments.

However, all that will count for nothing when they walk out at Seaview this afternoon.Sloan knows more than most that cup finals are all about what happens on the day and no amount of preparation or game planning can change that.With Olympic what you see is what you get.There are no prima donnas in the squad and they have all bought into the team ethos ndash one in, all in.The Olympic boss has made a few shrewd signings since last season and the new faces have gelled well with the group.Olympic may have lost top scorer Niall Murray to Crumlin Star, but Stefan Mason has proved more than a capable replacement.Stefan, now in his second spell at the club, joined from Drumaness Mills at the start of the season and his insatiable appetite in a main strikerrsquos role has endeared him to all.He is a nightmare for all defenders as he never stays still and is continually looking for space. He is not afraid to shoot and is also as brave as they come, adding a bit of physicality to his game in recent times.He has formed a perfect partnership with the under-rated Chris McNamara and the potentially explosive Nathan Jones mdash and all three are reliable matchwinners.Paul Dickson, another new signing, first came to prominence a few years ago when he starred for Noel lsquoDixiersquo Deanrsquos emerging Temple Rangers side that famously reached the semi-finals of the Clarence Cup.Since then he has played for Ballynahinch United and Saintfield United, but his adventurous style of play from the back has given Olympic an added dimension to their play.He has been joined in the squad by Anton McGrattan, a stylish midfielder, who gets up and down the park with ease and who is not an easy player to dispossess or put off his game.Basically, the rest of the Olympic remains the same and therein lies the secret of their success. Goalkeeper Ryan Walsh, a member of the Amateur Leaguersquos representative team, has enhanced his growing reputation this season and he rarely makes mistakes.Manager Sloan has the luxury of being able to play a number of formations at the back. Jason Noade is a colossus in the centre of defence with either Stevie McGoran, Connor Reid, Dickson or the highly-rated Dalton Tate flanking him.Midfield enforcer Ryan Noade,he is fit, can also play in the back four, but he, brother Stevie, Shane Murray and workaholic Ryan Molloy make up a formidable midfield unit with McGrattan able to cover any position in the engine room.Olympic have serious strength in depth and James McClean, Aaron McLean, Adam McClean, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Darren Lyons and Reece McConnell are all ready to step up to the markthey are required.However, standing in Olympicrsquos way is one of their own, now making Rathfriland tick.Andy Kilmartin started out at Olympic as a raw teenager with immense talent.He signed for Glasgow Celtic before moving to Glentoran, Portdown and Glenavon where he won an Irish Cup medal.The martinette is now pulling Rathfrilandrsquos strings alongside Newcastlersquos Jonathan Scannell and Downpatrickrsquos Peter Telford and Ruairi Fitzpatrick.Olympic know these players inside out and given a fair wind, they hope to blow Rathfriland away in what promises to be an intriguing final.Coincidentally, this will be Telfordrsquos fth Border Cup final appearance, but he has yet to appear on a winning side.He has lost three finals with Downpatrick FC and one with Kilmore Rec and is hoping that it will be a case of fth time lucky this afternoon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Out.jpg","title":"Out of Africa book looks at richness of sharing humanity together  ","story":"THE latest book by Downpatrick author Dr Stan Papenfus has just been published.Out of Africa has a title that he plagiarised from Pliny, the ancient Roman writer, who wrote: ldquoOut of Africa always something new.The subtitle of this book, lsquoSharing our livesrsquorsquo, derives from an African proverb mdash lsquoA person is a person through peoplersquo. It an also be translated as lsquoA person becomes a person through peoplersquo.The signicance of this proverb becomes ever more clear in the being and becoming of the three story tellers who share their lives with Dr Papenfus.Each one of them expresses and explores the truth of their own experiences and each one has their personal reality confirmed by the events and situations that unfold. In this telling, they also create how they who are and who they can be.Gabriel Makamanzi, from Zimbabwe, specically sees his own problems and dficulties belonging not merely to himself, but to the whole community in which he lives.This community is brought alive for us as he describes it and he expects us to relate it to our own problems and dficulties. In this way, he says, we all work together to discover our own creative freedom and realise our potential.Gabriel notes that le is for love. And yet, without honesty, our personal and shared reality is not reality at all.Instead, it is a pretense and those of us who pretend he sees us ldquoliving meaningless livesrsquorsquo.Dr Papenfus says: ldquoGabrielrsquos story challenges us, as it challenged him, to recognise our own poverty and despair, only to realise the spiritual power and richness of sharing our humanity with each other.The next exploration of time experiences is by Zakele Makaluza, from South Africa. He talks about his arrogance and his refusal to heed the warnings given to him by his ancestors, as they appear to him in his dreams.Zakelersquos experiences also refer to his relationship with bees, but not ordinary bees, rather with those ldquogentlemen of the honeyrsquorsquo sent by his ancestors to remind him of his duties to others, especially to members of his own clan.Dr Stan said: ldquoZakele, in his exploration of his experiences, brings us to an awareness of our own integrity or lack or integrity, in ourselves and in our relationship with others. He realises his potential only after he is persuaded of a certain truth, which he has been denying nearly all his le.ldquoIt is his cousin who opens up his awareness and tells him also that this was an experience that were lsquodestinedrsquo to share.The last person giving his testimony in the book is David Maganda, from Uganda. He came from a very big family and when his father died he was left to fend for himself, especially with regard to earning enough money to pay for his education.Even as a young boy, he secretly took a train from Uganda to Kenya, hoping to make enough money to sponsor his schooling. But, instead, he found himself on a ldquomission impossible as he calls it.He and his friend found themselves stranded and virtually penniless in the city of Nairobi. They had no place to stay, no work and no friends.How are they toto Uganda  They found themselves walking for mile after mile, along long and dusty roads, depending for their very survival on the kindness and pity of strangers. After living through a fierce storm and other hardships, they eventually arrived at the Kenya-Uganda border. Here, in their completely squalid state, they were interrogated by the police, who eventually let them cross the border.Arriving back in Uganda, they miraculously met Davidrsquos friendrsquos sister, who was working at a trading station. And so, at last, they find themselves able tohome.Each of their families get them to promise never again to engage in such a mad exploit. And yet within ten years he finds himself stranded once again, this time in the Sudan.Here, however, he is able to make do by earning money and pursuing some schooling and eventually being presented with a graduation certicate. Because of the particular school he attended, he was also able to become a confirmed Christian. However, he discovers, through his interaction with others, that his Christianity is only lukewarm.Through many strange encounters he eventually learns how to accept Christ into his very heart of hearts.As a result of this, he preaches the good news of salvation and in Northern Sudan he is even beaten and imprisoned.As time goes by he meets his we, Gillian, at a theological college in England. Today, David lives in Belfast and is only a lay preacher, but also someone who teaches others how to explore and discover the meaning of their lives and with others, how to realise their potential.Out of Africa is available on loan from Downpatrick Library and can also be bought from amazon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/1st January 2020 Seals.jpg","title":"Seals prosper in Strangford Lough  ","story":"STRANGFORD Lough is proving to be a popular nursery for grey seals.The largest sea inlet in Ireland can boast having  pups born in its waters during last autumn, the most since records began almost  years ago.The National Trust, which records the number of wildle visiting the area, revealed there were  adults in the lough at the peak of the breeding season last year ndash something of a turnaround for the protected species.In the early s records show that only around six or seven grey seals were born in the area each year.Lead ranger at Strangford Lough Hugh Thurgate say several factors have contributed to the growth in numbers.He said: ldquoThe boom reflects the burgeoning population in Scottish waters which is pushing the population down the North Channel and into the Irish Sea and seals are being forced to seek out new places to breed.ldquoThe shelter of Strangford is a strong draw for seals on the look-out for alternative spots to relax on shore during the breeding and moulting seasons.Mr Thurgate agrees that Strangford Lough is just the place for them.He added: ldquoThe seals are looking for a safe and protected place to raise their young ndash somewhere that provides protection from the elements and is relatively free from disturbance ndash which Strangford Lough offers.ldquoPups are quite vulnerable.

They’re continually digging up unexploded bombs throughout Germany. “Through in-laws of my brother, who married in Germany, I spoke to someone who was on the Russian front. I got a lot of information close to the wire plus a lot of research.“People have reviewed the book, went through it with a fine-tooth comb and commended its accuracy.”Explaining how the book led to him crossing paths with Angela Merkel he said: “Writing a period historical novel requires a lot of research for the product to be authentic enough for the reader to believe in it and to buy into the plot. “The story begins north of Berlin, at a hotel situated on the shores of Großdöllner See, in the district of New Brandenburg. It was during this time that I discovered the chancellor had grown up in the area with her family.“I sent her a letter of appreciation for her service as a politician, along with a copy of my book for her and her husband to read on her retirement.“Just before Christmas, I received a letter of thanks from her office.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One source described it as a ldquoshouting match.The process is continuing in a week that will witness two further strikes by workers in Northern Irelandrsquos crisis-hit health service. Parties are at odds over proposed legislative protections for Irish language speakers and reform of a contentious Stormont veto mechanism called the petition of concern.Politicians are also trying to agree changes to Assembly rule to make it less susceptible to implosion in the future.The UK and Irish governments are anticipated to table the outline of a deal later this week, and urge the five main parties to sign up to it.Mr Murphy rejected the suggestion that giving politicians more time would make a dference.ldquoWe have been at this for three years, when is enough time enough time  he said.ldquoWe donrsquot need dramatics, we donrsquot need grandstanding ndash what we need is political will to get an agreement.ldquoThe issues have been rehearsed and well-rehearsed for a long time now.Mr Murphy also moved to downplay the signicance of the apparent bad-tempered exchanges during the leadersrsquo meeting. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Sinn Feinrsquos Conor Murphy and Gerry Kelly at Stormont  --ldquoYou get good days and days when people are a little more tetchy, I wouldnrsquot get overly worried about it, he said.ldquoWhatrsquos important is what comes out at the end of this process, not about what happens at every junction throughout it.If a deal is not reached by the January  deadline, legislation to give civil servants additional powers to run Northern Irelandrsquos struggling public services expires and Mr Smith will assume a legal obligation to call a snap poll.Sinn Fein was the only one of the five main Stormont parties to hold a press conference on the state of the talks on Monday.Mr Murphy again singled out the DUP as the party he claimed was holding up progress.Earlier, Traditional Unionist Voiceleader Jim Allister, who is not involved in the talks, said there was absolutely no need, requirement or justication for an Irish language act.He claimed the sector was already ldquoover-feted, pointing to the education of children in Irish.He said: ldquoIt wants more, more, more. Why ldquoBecause the whole agenda of an Irish language act has nothing to do with linguistics, it has everything to do with politics, and the politics of a weaponised demand for an Irish language act is about de-Britishising Northern Ireland, making it a more uncomfortable place for unionists in their own land.ldquoI am very clear, therefore, no unionist should be conceding anything in that regard..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sinn Fein: Extending powersharing talks would be pointless article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

John Mulgrew met him at Terry’s Killaney Estate to discuss the grand whiskey and gin producing plans There’s nothing about Terry Cross and Derek Hardy’s plans for the Hinch Distillery and visitor centre in Co Down that feels like any corners are being cut.Former Delta Print and Packaging boss Terry has turned his attention to whiskey and gin with his new venture – a £m development based literally beside his grand home, outside Carryduff.Looking at a host of detailed artist’s impressions – on show inside Terry’s home – it’s clear there’s both signicant time and money being put in to the venture. It will end up as a , sq ft facility and visitor experience with a bar, restaurant andspaces.Derek is the man who will run the business. He’s been involved in the drinks trade for years, turning his hand to a range of roles, from wine to fizzy water.“It’s a single malt distillery, and the other important part of it is the visitor centre. It’s really our brand home,” Derek told Ulster Business.“It’s about showing off Hinch and showing off Co Down. It allows us to hold events. There is a , sq ft internal courtyard, so we would be able to host - people for an event… our imagination is boundless.“In terms of test distilling, we will start our test around February March and be in production by April or May.”The current Hinch whiskey on the market is coming from a range of sources – already aged. The grain element in the whiskey coming from Great Northern Distillery.“We have tried to look for our niche. In our Time collection, it’s about aged blends. We have our three, five and -year-old sherry finish, a -year-old Amarone which is in the cask already, then finishing up with a -year-old in that range.“Because of the close relationships with the distilleries which have sourced this from, with the grain element we will continue to buy the same grain that was used in those whiskies. We reckon we can pretty much duplicate what we currently have, in the future.“We also have ambitions to launch our signature, single malt range, coming out of the distillery.”As far as output goes, it should be able to produce , litres of pure alcohol, single malt, but that number could soar to two million with extra mash tuns.Derek’s own career has taken him to global food giants such as Unilever, working specically for Batchelors foods, before moving to the then SmithKline Beecham as an account manager.His first move into the alcohol and beverage sector was with wine company Ernest and Julio Gallo where he spent four years. A stint at Ballygowan spring water followed.It’s also due to launch the first of its ‘craft beer’ range. That will see it ageing whiskey in barrels from Irish breweries including Heaney, Kinnegar and Whitewater.And as whiskey takes at least three years to develop, Hinch is also producing a gin – Ninth Wave. According to Derek, they spent around four or five months developing a series of recipes, before deciding on what will now be their own premium gin.It’s also Derek’s penchant for ancient history, dating back to Celtic times, that inspired the gin’s name. It comes from the Celtic form of heaven, ‘the other world’.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
