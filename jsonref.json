Immunity from a single dose, however, wanes more quickly. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisations at UKHSA, said: \u0027The Covid vaccines are very safe. \u0027Based on a highly precautionary approach, we are advising a longer interval between Covid infection and vaccination for those aged under 18. \u0027This increase is based on the latest reports from the UK and other countries, which may suggest that leaving a longer interval between infection and vaccination will further reduce the already very small risk of myocarditis in younger age groups.\u0027Young people and parents should be reassured that myocarditis is extremely rare, at whatever point they take up the vaccine, and this change has been made based on the utmost precaution.\u0027\u0027We keep all advice under constant review and will revise it according to the latest data and evidence.\u0027UK Government data justifying today\u0027s update shows nine in every million under-18s in the UK will get myocarditis after a single dose of Pfizer\u0027s Covid jab, the same as around one per 110,000. But for every million doses of the vaccine administered to children, they will prevent around 150 hospitalisations from Covid.The JCVI held off on recommending second doses for children because data from Israel and the US suggested the myocarditis risk is as high as one in 10,000.  But real-world UK data in slightly older adults - who also saw above normal rates of myocarditis in other countries - was not higher after the second jab.This is thought to be because the dosing gap between doses here is 12 weeks, whereas it\u0027s between three and four weeks in the US and Israel. The JCVI believes that 12-week gap might also be the sweet spot for getting a jab after natural infection in young people, which prompted today\u0027s tweak to the guidance. There is also evidence that rates of myocarditis in Britain are similar in 16 and 17-year-olds and 18 to 29-year-olds, after the second jab.This is why the JCVI recommend two jabs for healthy older teens earlier this week. But it is still weighing up the evidence on younger children. It is unclear why the longer space between vaccination or natural infection reduces the risk of myocarditis yet. This gap might give the immune system time to calm down from the reaction to the first dose or infection.  During Covid infection or immunisation, the body produces cells to fight the virus. If the disease-fighting cells enter the heart, they can inflame the muscle. "},{"url":null,"title":"House Fraser shut iconic Oxford Street shop year","story":"Food sales volumes were also up by 0.6 per cent, the ONS added, and remain 3.9 per cent above pre-Covid levels.But while shoppers opted to avoid high streets, sales online continued to rise and now account for 28.1 per cent of all spending - up from 27.9 per cent in August.There was a particular surge in department store sales online, up by 3.8 per cent, meaning nearly 10p in every £1 spent online goes to the likes of John Lewis, Debenhams or House of Fraser, the ONS said.By comparison, household goods stores saw a 3.6 per cent drop in online sales.Darren Morgan, ONS director of economic statistics, said: \u0027Household goods were the main driver of this month\u0027s decline, with a fall of nearly 10 per cent, while food sales ticked back up after falling last month.\u0027Petrol sales exceeded their pre-pandemic level for the first time, with filling stations reporting very strong sales during the last week of September.\u0027Despite the lifting of restrictions, in-store retail sales remain subdued, with many consumers still opting to shop online.\u0027Retail chiefs laid the blame at the doorstep of Government and urged ministers to find ways to reduce the issues with supply chains and high energy costs.Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said: \u0027Retailers will be concerned by the slump in sales, just as they begin their preparations for the all-important Christmas period.\u0027Fuel shortages, wet weather and low consumer confidence all contributed to lower consumer demand this month, with household goods, furniture and books all hit particularly hard.\u0027She added: \u0027For the sake of the UK\u0027s economic recovery, it is vital that retail sales bounce back as we near the festive season.\u0027Labour shortages across the supply chains, on farms, factories, warehouses and lorry drivers, all threaten to derail this recovery and it is vital that Government finds a long-term solution to this problem.\u0027Looking forward, commentators said the rest of the year could see traditional festive shopping patterns shift as a result of the problems.Silvia Rindone, EY UK and Ireland retail expert, said: \u0027Over recent years, shoppers have tended to wait until late December to buy for Christmas in the hope of bagging some great bargains.\u0027However this year, with news of supply chain disruption and supply concerns for key products, shoppers are likely to pull forward their non-perishable Christmas spending into October and November to make sure they get what they want.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"England cricket star Alex Hales DENIES calling black dog Kevin","story":"Share this articleAzeem Rafiq calls for \u0027total clear-out\u0027 of Yorkshire CCC leadership over racism scandal | UK News | Sky NewsAzeem Rafiq \u0027determined\u0027 sharing experiences of racism will be pivotal moment for sport and society - BBC SportYorkshire head coach Andrew Gale set to be sacked after Azeem Rafiq\u0027s damning testimony"},{"url":null,"title":"MPs watered proposals ban paid consultancy work","story":" The changes would also ban MPs from accepting paid work as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant, and from accepting payment or offers of employment to act as political consultants.A Government spokesperson said: \u0027The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.\u0027This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.\u0027This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.\u0027But Chris Bryant, the Labour chairman of the Committee on Standards, replied to the statement on Twitter saying: \u0027Except it doesn\u0027t mean that.

But a major accounting error in 2019 rocked the bank, forcing it to rein in its expansion plans. Royal Mail announced a £200m share buyback, and a £200m special idend, following a jump in profits and ongoing strong demand for parcel deliveries. Pre-tax profits rose to £315m in the six months to 26th September, up from £17m a year ago when the pandemic was hitting the UK economy. Reported operating profits hit £311m, following a £20m operating loss a year earlier, “driven by recovery in profitability” after the negative impact of Covid-19 and restructuring charges a year ago. Simon Thompson, chief executive of Royal Mail, said the ‘re-invention of Royal Mail is inflight’ following cost-cutting programmes. Thompson adds that Royal Mail is developing plans to address inflationary pressures in the economy which he says “will impact next year and beyond”. That plan will include increased automation, and “tariff increases where we can on certain letter services from January 2022”. Covid-19 and international conveyance costs are unwinding at a slower rate than it expected this year. In the short term, Royal Mail is hedged against rising fuel and electricity prices, but has seen a rise in wages for temporary workers such as HGV lorry drivers. And in the longer term, it is “increasingly clear that inflationary pressures will persist”, Royal Mail adds, saying the increase in National Insurance contributions will cost around £50m in the 2022-23 financial year. It also needs to agree a new pay deal with the UniteCMA and CWU unions. Plus, Royal Mail’s fuel and energy hedges will start to unwind. National Grid lifted its outlook despite the fire in September at Britain’s main subsea cable with France — called IFA1. As the FT points out: The National Food and Strategic Reserves Administration has said it would disclose the details of the move on its website. A spokeswoman for the Reserves Administration explained: Beijing declined to comment on the US’s invitation to participate in a joint release of oil, though. So it’s not yet clear if authorities are doing so in response to the request from Washington, which came in a virtual summit earlier this week between Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, or due to their own concerns over higher prices. Bloomberg points out that China has already used its reserves once this year: Under the plan, these countries could join the US in a coordinated effort to lower global energy prices. Reuters reports this morning that the Biden White House asked China, India and Japan if they would push some of their strategic reserves of oil onto the market, to drive down costs.  The US has its own Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which can be tapped to push down prices or increase supplies as needed, but is also pushing for a wider response. The unusual move follows a jump in gasoline prices, and the wider surge in US inflation to a 30-year high. Having failed to persuade Opec+ to speed up its production, the US is now looking to pile pressure on the group. The prospect of more oil hitting the market has pushed Brent crude down below $80 per barrel to as low as $79.28, the lowest since early October, after falling sharply yesterday too. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. National Grid has hiked its profit forecasts after reporting a jump in earnings.... as its subsea cables that connecting Britain to other countries benefit from high energy prices across Europe.  The jump was partly driven by higher auction prices across its interconnector portfolio, the high voltage cables which connect the UK’s electricity systems to other countries. And the early commissioning of the world’s longest under-sea electricity cable between Britain and Norway could also boost the firm’s fortunes, as well as improving the UK’s energy security. National Grid bought Western Power Distribution, the UK’s largest electricity distribution network operator, for £7.8bn, earlier this year, as part of a pivot away from gas and towards electricity. That gave a lift to operating profits, as did National Grid’s new IFA2 (Interconnexion France-Angleterre 2) link to France. Revenues from electricity transmission also rose. National Grid told the City: Shareholders will see the benefits -- National Grid now expects earnings per share to be ‘significantly’ higher than previously thought, partly due to higher auction prices. The new North Sea Link (NSL) which will be able to channel up to 1.4 gigawatts of electricity between Norway and the United Kingdom, will also help, it says: Interconnector operators make money through auctions, so when price difference between two different markets are wide, profits are higher. But those same high prices are hitting consumers and businesses who have seen their bills soar as energy suppliers have struggled under record gas prices and rising electricity costs.

File photograph: Getty The recent rise in coronavirus infections has compelled the Health Service Executive to enlist a private company to help meet the surge in demand for tests.Monday marked the busiest day of the pandemic to date for community testing. And the increase in positive cases in this fourth pandemic wave has put the health service and coronavirus testing teams under severe strain.A further 3,633 cases were reported on Wednesday, with the latest figures showing 634 patients were hospitalised (an increase of 20 on Tuesday) including 119 in intensive care. More than 50,000 infections have been recorded in the last fortnight.Reacting to the escalating infection rate, State chief medical officer Tony Holohan said cancelling social plans in the run-up to Christmas is a “responsible” decision. And he urged people to reduce social contacts.The HSE said that more than 24,000 appointments were offered in community testing centres on Monday after it carried out some 20,000 tests a day over the last week. This is well in excess of the 15,000 daily tests that the community testing service was initially established to support.The demand has led to delays in booking tests with no appointments for self-referral tests at any of the eight Dublin testing sites, or four in Cork, available on the HSE’s Book a Covid-19 test website on Tuesday and Wednesday. A spokeswoman said that, since Monday, private testing provider RocDoc is operating a testing centre on its behalf at Dublin Airport. This would initially provide 500 appointments a day, rising “quickly” to 1,000, she said.She said there are plans to open similar testing centres – operated on behalf of the Health Service Executive by RocDoc – at Cork and Shannon Airports and it is expected these would be in operation over the next two weeks. Additional staff are also being recruited to work in community test centres.The HSE is working “to put further additional external resources in place to increase our testing capacity, including potentially other private service providers”, said the spokeswoman.Political reactionThere has been “a sustained extremely high demand” for tests at community testing centres. And this reflects “the high prevalence of the disease and other illnesses at this time”, she said.The HSE’s priority, said the spokeswoman, is to allow GPs to refer patients for PCR testing where warranted and for close contacts of confirmed cases to be able to get an appointment as quickly as possible.“Ensuring these two groups are prioritised does mean that those outside these categories may not be able to book a test until the following day.”Labour Party health spokesman Duncan Smith called on the Government to outline a plan to clear the backlog in PCR tests. He said people were waiting several days to get one.“This is a ridiculous situation... It’s clear that testing centres are currently under-resourced and unable to deal with the latest surge in Covid cases,” he said.Dr Holohan said that 200,000 people who could potentially be infected in December had not yet been and transmission could be avoided if people took action now. If they did, as models predicted, become infected, it would mean 4,000 people would be hospitalised over the Christmas period.“There is no single measure on its own that will curb this. We need to use all of the measures together and use them properly and appropriately,” he told RTÉ’s News at One.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord taoiseach easily needled by kelly on teacher misunderstanding","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has disputed an allegation from Alan Kelly, in which the Labour leader claimed that Martin told him teachers are exempt from the requirement for close contacts of Covid-19 cases to restrict their movements for five days.Taoiseach Micheál Martin: It’s a rough time trying to keep national spirits up in the face of constant opposition harassment.   Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIf only the anti-vaxx brigade were as easily needled as our thin-skinned Taoiseach. The entire population would be fully jabbed in jig time with a relaxed Christmas now in prospect.A year and a half ago, Micheál Martin finally achieved his political heart’s desire. But living the dream he is not.The Fianna Fáil leader took the reins of power in the teeth of a pandemic and has been battling to control the medicine and the message ever since. But happy to do it. Happy to hold the most powerful office in the land with a real job of work ahead of him.Yet with each hard-won success along the road to conquering the virus, Micheál is discovering that Covid-19 has more turns in it than Corkscrew Hill. When it seems like the end is in sight (the very strong vaccine uptake seemed so promising) and restrictions are cautiously lifted, case numbers and hospital admissions start climbing again.Corrective measures are proposed and he is lambasted. Then he gets scant credit if they work because the narrative has already moved on to lambasting him for not reopening the country quickly enough.An increasingly weary public hears about committees meeting about meetings with never-ending talk around possibly introducing agents such as antigen tests, proper ventilation equipment and booster shots. There are rolling discussions about imminent rollouts rolled out ages ago in other jurisdictions. Whatever happened to the “speed trumps perfection mantra”?So it’s a rough time for a new Taoiseach trying to keep national spirits up in the face of constant opposition harassment, particularly if he is looking over his shoulder for a scene-stealing Tánaiste while relying on a less-than-stellar line-up of Fianna Fáil Ministers for close support.And the pressure certainly seems to be getting to Micheál.He was irritable and impatient during Leaders’ Questions, preferring to complain about Sinn Féin’s well-worn populist approach to adversarial politics instead of dealing with Mary Lou McDonald’s pertinent questions about the uninspiring song and dance his Government is making about addressing the rising Covid figures.Hurt reactionPointing out how she shamelessly shoehorns in the clichés for maximum sound bite exposure does not address a valid query. Party politics don’t cut ice with people wondering why a big booster campaign (Simon Coveney has offered Army assistance) isn’t already under way for anyone eligible for a third shot or why antigen tests aren’t freely available at every corner chemist or why long-promised air filtration devices have yet to reach most schools.The Opposition is there to ask the why.The Taoiseach’s hurt reaction to hardly surprising criticism does not instil optimism in anxious minds. When the Sinn Féin leader spoke of “dithering, delaying and indecision” on the latest urgent issues in this constantly evolving crisis, he accused her of “taking a isive approach to Covid-19 from the start”.Micheál can furnish chapter and verse of how his approach to sticking by the expert medical advice has been successful. That the ingrates across the chamber floor will never acknowledge anything is becoming his default reaction. They can do this because they aren’t the ones in charge.And they want to know what is happening now.A Dáil argument with the Taoiseach and Mary Lou is par for the course these days. But Micheál’s currently fragile temperament turned nature on its head on Wednesday when the Labour leader’s turn came around.Alan Kelly is supposed to do the theatrics. When gaskets need to be blown, AK47 is your man. In the natural scheme of things, it is the Taoiseach who is supposed to complain about Deputy Kelly roaring and shouting at him, not the other way around.Instead, the pair of them had a glorious row over what appeared to be nothing more than a verbal misunderstanding on Tuesday afternoon. That evening it sparked an unremarkable bout of noisy combustion from Kelly, dressed up with some indignant social media squawking from his education spokesman, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin.Kelly said he approached the Taoiseach as he was preparing to leave the chamber and asked him if teachers would be required to observe the latest restrictions by staying at home for five days if somebody in their household had Covid.Scandalised statementHe was so shocked with the answer that he swears he was given (that teachers would have to continue working) that he immediately sought out tweeting Aodhán to tell him what happened before rushing out a scandalised statement.In less fraught circumstances, Micheál Martin might have nonchalantly dismissed the episode as a simple case of two men getting their wires crossed, with Kelly’s response nothing more than the usual histrionics.Instead, he said at a press conference that he was “very angry” at the way his words were “miscontructed” by the Labour leader. Not only that, but the very brief exchange didn’t even happen in the Dáil chamber, as Kelly claimed.Except the video of the session in question shows AK47 and Micheál in conversation as the Taoiseach is on his feet and gathering his papers, preparing to leave the chamber. No doubt in Alan’s mind afterwards about what was said to him. The subsequent denial was a spooked U-turn.He took his umbrage to Leaders’ Questions because as God is his witness, and he will remember those words to his dying day, this is exactly what the Taoiseach replied when he inquired if teachers were bound by the new rule.“No, teachers are exempt” is what Micheál said to him. Straight up. He had never come into the Dáil “and accused someone of telling porkies”.The Taoiseach has a different version (somewhat undermined by his lack of awareness of where the conversation took place). It transpired that there was an angry phone call between the two when Micheál heard what the Labour leader was saying about him.“You learn something new every day,” he said icily to Kelly.“I learned something about you yesterday that I will not forget, and that will govern our relationship for here onwards,” he continued in clipped tones.“I’ve never seen the likes of it before, in terms of what transpired,” fumed the Taoiseach, thin-lipped and clearly riled up.‘Cool it!’Kelly’s eyes widened. Mary Lou nearly swallowed her face mask. The TDs present perked up considerably. This was quite a spat.“Extraordinary,” whistled Micheál, giving a breathless account of their “30 or 40-second engagement” before adding: “I’m just putting it straight now.”Kelly roared: “If you want to call me a liar, call me a liar.”The Taoiseach insisted: “I never said those words.”At one stage, he told Kelly to keep his voice down and “calm it down! Cool it!”Kelly said he wouldn’t be intimidated by “your threats and roaring down the phone” inside and outside the chamber.He was drinking a glass of water during those disputed words with Kelly. Perhaps that was where the misunderstanding arose. Perhaps Micheál was trying out a bit of ventriloquism – “a gottle of geer”. That sort of thing.Or maybe it was simply a case of a misplaced comma.Alan thinks the Taoiseach said: “No, teachers are exempt.”But maybe he said: “No teachers are exempt.”That would explain it. Commas are important.And Micheál needs to calm down and chill."},{"url":null,"title":"the less talk about triggering article 16 the better coveney says","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said the ‘less talk…the better’ about the triggering of Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol in the coming weeks. Photograph: Alan BetsonMinister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said the “less talk…the better” about the triggering of Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol.He said the EU is prepared and continuing to prepare for that outcome should the mechanism be triggered, which would suspend customs and food safety checks on goods entering Northern Ireland.Mr Coveney added that there would be “a very robust response should that happen, particularly if large elements of the protocol were to be set aside”.But he told the Seanad that “for now, the less talk about the triggering of Article 16 and its consequences, I think the better, for the next couple of weeks”.Addressing the Upper House in a debate on the protocol, he said “the focus should be on negotiation, partnership and trying to find a middle ground” which “all sides in Northern Ireland can at least live with and move forward on”.His comments came as political parties in Northern Ireland urged Britain’s Brexit minister David Frost to find agreement with the European Union over the protocol. Lord Frost spent two days in Belfast meeting political leaders and representatives from the business community.He said on Wednesday that triggering the clause, which can effectively suspend elements of the arrangements, remained a “very real option” but he would prefer to reach agreement with the EU.Discussions continue on Wednesday and Thursday between the EU and UK teams, with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic and Lord Frost due to meet on Friday.Give every chanceMr Coveney, who met Mr Sefcovic on Tuesday, said “our focus remains on those ongoing EUUK talks. We should give those talks every chance of success”. He said it was “difficult to sustain” a positive relationship when one party “holds out the threat to destabilise their own recently negotiated agreements”.Mr Coveney told Senators the particular form of Brexit chosen by the British government created trade barriers. Leaving the single market and customs union and prioritising the pursuit of regulatory ergence “has inevitably created burdens for businesses and trade”, he said.“That choice bring new checks and controls on goods and led to significant supply chain challenges resulting in needless friction, delays and some cases shortages.”He said the protocol is there to mitigate any negative effects as much as possible.

You don’t need to be a global warming sceptic to challenge what’s coming out.”He also encouraged people to look at the BBC and Sky and coverage of the foreign minister of Tuvalu.“Nobody pointed out there was a report that came out in 2018 which showed, in the last four years, the land mass in his island has increased by 70 hectares. Wasn’t that worth looking at? But, no, we just did it as a piece of PR.”Speaking to the Freeview Outside the Box conference, Mr Neil said that the BBC, Sky and US broadcasters “peddled, basically, conspiracy theories for two-and-a-half years that Mr Trump had only got to the White House because the Kremlin was behind him”.He went on: “For the first year or so of the Covid crisis, if you raised questions that there was more to it than just coincidence that Wuhan and Covid were in the same place, you were a sinophobe, a conspiracy theorist, and you weren\u0027t allowed to get on to the mainstream media. It\u0027s quite clear now that Wuhan played a major part.If we want to be referees, if we want to be gatekeepers to call \u0027the nutters\u0027 to account - and there are plenty on the Right and the Left, the anti-vaxxers and all the rest, we need to get our own house in order.”The BBC and Sky declined to comment.Mr Neil also addressed his acrimonious departure from GB News. He has one last television job in him, he said, because “I don’t want GB News to be a full stop in my broadcasting career”.Joining the station was “the biggest single mistake of my career”, he said. The launch was a “shambles” and there was a danger that the station will now “just slide into irrelevance and obscurity”.Asked if GB News had succeeded in filling a gap in the market, Mr Neil replied: “To fill a gap, you have to have an audience.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Watch live as Grant Shapps announces Government\u0026#39s revised HS2 planLeonid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesSexism and racism are driving criticism of Kamala Harris, says White HouseThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaThanksgiving 2021: pies, parades, presidential pardons and the history behind the dayWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"got lucky say investigators believe liverpool bomb set accident","story":"The terrorist bomb detonated at a Liverpool hospital may have gone off when it was jostled as the taxi in which the bomber was travelling came to a stop, with investigators admitting: We got lucky.A search of Emad al-Swealmeen\u0027s home and an examination of his online purchases showed he was attempting to build a sophisticated, powerful bomb that would have caused damage, death and destruction on a huge scale.The  can also reveal that the 32-year-old, who converted to Christianity, was seen at his local mosque every day during Ramadan in April, around the same time time he began constructing his bomb.Sources claim the Iraqi-born asylum seeker attended the mosque all day every day during the religious festival and was seen praying with a fellow Muslim a week before the attack.The revelation will further fuel suspicion that Swealmeen\u0027s conversion to Christianity four years ago was a ploy to help him persuade the Home Office to let him stay in the UK.Counter-terrorism police and intelligence agencies remain unclear as to Swealmeen\u0027s intended target – either the Liverpool Women\u0027s Hospital where the explosion occurred or the Remembrance Sunday service at Liverpool Cathedral, under a mile away.They increasingly believe it was an Islamist attack although they cannot rule out that the state of the terrorist\u0027s mental health may also have played a part.A source said: Methodology wise, this attack is entirely jihadist – but we have an open mind as to what precisely was motivating him. If he built a much more destructive device then the detonation looks accidental. It looks lucky.While investigators continue building a picture of what happened on Sunday, sources have said it is possible the sensitive detonator went off accidentally, killing Swealmeen.In moving to get ready to get out of the taxi, he might have set it off. Or else, as the vehicle has come to a stop, he has dropped it or jostled it and it has gone off, said a source. Home-made devices are inherently unstable.Police have uncovered at least two types of explosives in Swealmeen\u0027s flat, and chemicals purchased online suggest he had built a sophisticated detonator intended to set off a much larger bomb. On Wednesday, residents living close to the property in Sutcliffe Street, in the Kensington area of Liverpool, were evacuated when police found several suspicious packages.Evidence uncovered so far suggests Swealmeen\u0027s device was smaller than the bomb constructed by Salman Abedi, the Manchester Arena suicide bomber who murdered 22 people and wounded hundreds more. One likelihood is that the bomb was being constructed using the HMTD high explosive, similar to that used in the 77 attacks in London in 2005.A source said it appeared Swealmeen had built a primer and a secondary explosive, using two different chemical explosives purchased on the internet. Intelligence agencies are scouring for any associates who might also be involved but currently believe he was acting alone and in all likelihood found plans to construct the bomb online.On Wednesday, police confirmed that a post-mortem examination showed Swealmeen had died as a result of injuries sustained from fire and explosion.Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, the head of counter-terrorism policing North West, said: A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device. We know that Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time.We have now traced a next of kin for Swealmeen who has informed us that he was born in Iraq. Our enquiries have found that Swealmeen has had episodes of mental illness. This will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand.Meanwhile, more details of Swealmeen\u0027s asylum status have emerged, revealing that, despite being turned down in 2015, his case was still unresolved when he blew himself up at the weekend.After first arriving in the UK from Dubai, he lodged an application for leave to remain, claiming to be a Syrian refugee whose life would be in danger if he returned home.The hearing took place on April 16, 2015, but after testing the veracity of his claims, Home Office officials rejected the application on June 2 that year because they did not believe he was Syrian. Swealmeen sought leave to appeal the decision, but that was refused in August 2015.On March 27, 2017, he was confirmed into the Church of England at Liverpool Cathedral and also changed his name to Enzo Almeni in tribute to his motor-racing hero, Enzo Ferrari.In January this year, he lodged a fresh application with the Home Office, using his new name and arguing that his Christian faith would lead to his persecution if returned to the Middle East. That application was still being processed at the weekend when he blew himself up outside Liverpool Women\u0027s Hospital.It is thought some of the delays might be down to the backlog caused by the pandemic, but on Wednesday Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, said the case illustrated the merry-go-round\u0027\u0027 of a broken asylum system.It comes as Assistant Commissioner Matt Jukes, the head of counter-terror policing, warned that the public needed to be vigilant in the run-up to Christmas amid concern about more attacks.He said: Just as we enter the first busy festive period since the start of the pandemic, the terror threat level has been raised to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely. I know that will concern people, but policing is stepping up our activity to protect the UK. It also means that we need the public to do the same, by being more vigilant and trusting us with their concerns.Witnesses to the bomb attack have described the moment they tried to rescue Swealmeen and taxi driver David Perry seconds after the blast.Security guard Darren Knowles rushed to the aid of Mr Perry after he fled the vehicle, and said he was screaming: Someone has blown me up. I want my wife.Mr Knowles described hearing a loud bang at the time of the explosion, and said he believed it was a mechanical failure before seeing Mr Perry rush from the taxi.He told the Mirror: He was panicking and screaming. He was trying to tell us, \u0027There is a passenger, there is a passenger\u0027.I was trying to say to him, \u0027Is he still in there?\u0027, and he was saying, \u0027He has tried to blow me up\u0027.Mr Knowles added: Everyone is calling me a hero but I was just doing my job.A delivery driver, named only as Liam, told the BBC how he tried to grab Swealmeen from the car moments after it exploded.Liam, 21, was parked in a car only metres from the taxi when the bomb was set off.Liam told the BBC: Explosions just went off and it shook the hospital building. Then I got closer to the car, I could smell the smoke and I could see the man in the back.I went to grab him but he engulfed in flames very quickly. I couldn\u0027t reach a hold of him without setting myself on fire.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Watch live as Grant Shapps announces Government\u0026#39s revised HS2 planLeonid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesSexism and racism are driving criticism of Kamala Harris, says White HouseThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaThanksgiving 2021: pies, parades, presidential pardons and the history behind the dayWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"man golden cufflinks can crack code ian flemings jewels","story":"It is a code-breaking test to suit the aspiring spy.A pair of cufflinks believed to have belonged to Ian Fleming, and passed down through his family, bear an intriguing inscription.The back of the cufflinks are inscribed with “WUS”, “SIL”, “UDH” and “NUF”.

But it has also raised questions about the role of churches and whether, out of a desire to do good, they can be naive in supporting the asylum claims of Christian converts.There can be no doubting that Christians are obliged to meet human need wherever they see it, and to offer advice and friendship to those who require them. Moreover, in a plural society, it is to be expected that people will move from one faith to another or, indeed, to no faith at all.There are many good reasons, too, why asylum seekers and immigrants in general might wish to become Christians. They may want to root themselves in the spiritual soil of their adoptive country. They may have a spiritual nature which seeks expression in worship and they have become disenchanted with the faith of their birth because of its drift to extremism. They may simply be looking for friendship.But fears that people traffickers and immigration lawyers are advising asylum seekers to obtain church affiliation as a way of strengthening their claim – since it will enable them to say they would be persecuted if they return to their birth country – appear to be well-founded. More worryingly, conversion to Christianity could make a very good cover for extremist or even terrorist activity.Are churches sometimes being too credulous? It is important for clergy and lay leaders to discern the motives that lie behind people coming to church and asking for baptism and membership. One way of judging whether a claim of conversion is genuine is to consider whether interest in Christianity arose before or after an initial claim or appeal was rejected. The Liverpool attacker, for example, converted after he was refused asylum. Church leaders should also make sure that the grounds are sound and that any convert has had adequate preparation for membership of their community. Are they always doing this?The other side to this issue, however, is the proper role of churches in the wider debate about asylum and immigration. On some issues, they have made a valuable contribution. Christians are especially vulnerable in many parts of the world to persecution based on religious faith, for example, and Britain has been slow to recognise this. This country has not done enough to offer refuge to Christians from Syria or Iraq, who are unable to live in the UN-sponsored camps, which are dominated by Islamists and from which Britain draws its quota of refugees. Those persecuted in Pakistan, because of blasphemy laws, or in Iran’s theocracy, similarly find little sympathy with British refugee settlement processes.Yet more generally, there has sometimes been an unwillingness to recognise that asylum and immigration are not always simple moral questions. All of us have to be aware, for instance, that some people apply for asylum in order to circumvent the usual immigration rules. Young men may wish to avoid conscription in their homeland others may want to come for economic reasons.Everyone must be treated humanely but it is the state’s role to take a view on the nation’s capacity to absorb refugees and immigrants, and the effect that this might have on the social and economic fabric of the UK. Church leaders ought to respect national processes for assessing claims, even if, from time to time, they can make suggestions about how to improve and revise such processes. Christians are required to love the stranger, whatever the circumstances, but must also recognise that the state has to take account of the wider interests of the nation and the common good.The worldwide movement of peoples goes on and Britain continues to be a magnet for large numbers. Churches can contribute to the moral discussion about national policy, and can also help asylum seekers with humanitarian aid and advice. What they are not equipped to do is to second guess the state in deciding on the validity of inidual claims.Michael Nazir-Ali is a former bishop of Rochester and now belongs to the Ordinariate in the Catholic ChurchMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Watch live as Grant Shapps announces Government\u0026#39s revised HS2 planLeonid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesSexism and racism are driving criticism of Kamala Harris, says White HouseThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaThanksgiving 2021: pies, parades, presidential pardons and the history behind the dayWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"joe bidens spineless foreign policy emboldening xi jinping","story":"Arguably the most demanding part of Joe Biden’s three-and-a-half hour video summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping this week was that the meeting seemingly took place well beyond the American President’s normal bedtime. One of the worst kept secrets in Washington is how little time the US leader actually spends in the Oval Office carrying out his presidential duties, and how much time he spends resting from the labours of high office.On a good day, Mr Biden will find time in the morning to attend the daily briefing session at the White House before participating in an undemanding evening event, such as attending a reception for the winners of the national basketball championships. Apart from that, the leader of the free world appears to spend the rest of the day sequestered away from the public eye lest he make any public gaffes, such as forgetting the names of key allies like the Australian Prime Minister. So the fact that Mr Biden did not begin his video summit with Beijing until 7.45pm DC time meant that he was surely well outside his comfort zone, being required to conduct important affairs of state well beyond his normal working hours.Mr Biden’s semi-detached regime is not dissimilar to that of Ronald Reagan in the last years of his presidency. But at least by then Mr Reagan had set in train the events that, as Margaret Thatcher later remarked, ended the Cold War with the Soviet Union “without firing a shot”.By contrast, all Mr Biden has to show for his first year in office is America’s catastrophic defeat in Afghanistan, a self-inflicted wound the strategic implications of which are likely to be felt for years to come.The inherent weakness of the Biden administration, and the current incumbent’s apparent inability to fulfil the daily workload expected of him, has certainly not passed unnoticed by Washington’s rivals, as is evident from Russia’s recent conduct.Russian President Vladimir Putin spent three hours talking over numerous global issues with Mr Biden during their summit in Geneva in June, which subsequently resulted in the US leader’s utter capitulation to Moscow on long-standing arms control demands.Clearly, to judge by Mr Putin’s subsequent conduct, the Russian despot got the measure of Mr Biden, to the extent that he no longer feels constrained about intimidating Washington’s allies in Europe, whether massing troops close to the borders of Ukraine and Poland or threatening Europe’s energy supplies.Now, to judge from the read-out from Monday night’s video summit between the American and Chinese leaders, it is Mr Xi’s turn to take advantage of the Biden administration’s increasing irrelevance in world affairs.Mr Biden’s first mistake was to agree to Beijing’s request for the summit in the first place. Mr Xi is in the process of seeking a third term in office, and participating in global summits with Beijing’s superpower rival certainly helps to boost his domestic standing. Furthermore, in the build-up to the summit, Beijing has maintained its aggressive stance towards Washington, announcing an alarming increase in its nuclear arsenal and resisting appeals for improved cooperation on climate change issues.Yet, so disinclined is Mr Biden to see Beijing as an adversary, preferring the term “competitor”, that the White House pressed on with the summit regardless in the naive hope that, simply by engaging with the Chinese leader, the meeting would somehow result in an easing of tensions. Instead, Mr Xi will have ended the meeting confident in the knowledge that, so long as Mr Biden remains in office, Beijing has little to fear from its superpower rival.Mr Biden’s supine approach was evident from his failure even to mention the key issue that has defined Sino-US relations during the past two years: Beijing’s role in the global coronavirus pandemic that has so far claimed five million lives.During Donald Trump’s presidency, Beijing was under constant pressure to offer more information about the origins of the virus and to come clean about what really took place during the early stages of the pandemic. Under Mr Biden the issue did not even merit a mention. The US president adopted a similarly spineless approach on issues such as Beijing’s brutal repression of millions of Muslim Uyghurs, the suppression of democracy in Hong Kong and its aggression towards Taiwan.For his part, the pugnacious Mr Xi was hardly diplomatic, warning that Washington was “playing with fire” over its continued support for Taiwan’s independent status. As was the case following the Biden-Putin summit in June, Mr Xi will have ended Monday’s meeting confident in the belief that he has nothing to fear so long as the current US administration remains in power.After all, if Mr Biden is not willing to hold Beijing to account for a pandemic that has created havoc across the world, he is hardly likely to defend Taiwan from Beijing’s long-standing ambition to seize control of the territory by brute force.More from NewsLeonid meteor shower 2021: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesPolitics latest news: Watch live as Grant Shapps sets out Government\u0026#39s revised HS2 planSexism and racism are driving criticism of Kamala Harris, says White HouseThe Briefing: Sign up for two-minute audio news updates on WhatsApp, Apple, Spotify and AlexaThanksgiving 2021: pies, parades, presidential pardons and the history behind the dayWinter solstice 2021: when is the shortest day of the year and why do pagans celebrate?More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"thursday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Few would deny that the handling of the Owen Paterson case has been a political car crash.

The Prime Minister urged Brits to get their booster vaccine to avoid new restrictions, with all over-s and vulnerable people now able to get a third dose six months after their second one. Today he told his Cabinet that while boosters will be the main defence, “we are still not out of the woods and we cannot be complacent”. Yet despite an R rate of . to ., cases ‘running hot’ and deaths at more than , a week, he has not actually triggered England’s ‘Plan B’ - which stops well short of a lockdown. So what’s going on  Here are the main questions answered. Why is Boris Johnson worried  Boris Johnson says there is a new threat as cases are spiking in European countries including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Describing it as a “blizzard”, he said: “We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent.” Perhaps, though, the Prime Minister needs to be more concerned about the situation closer to home. UK cases have been at a high level for months and are rising again after a long fall, up .% week-on-week. There are more than , deaths a week within  days of a positive test. Scientists who spoke to the Mirror suggested domestic policy - which has pretty much no Covid restrictions in England - would be far more to blame for a rise than surges in the virus abroad. It could be that waning immunity and colder weather, forcing people to huddle indoors, are helping the virus spread.  Will there be a lockdown for Christmas   A few weeks ago Boris Johnson was asked this, and replied: “I see no evidence whatever to think that any kind of lockdown is on the cards.” But asked a similar question last night, he told a No press conference: “Clearly we cannot rule anything out. “And the most important thing people can do to prevent further NPIs from being taken is to - non-pharmaceutical interventions that is, further restrictions - get the boosters. So yes, there could be a Christmas lockdown, it’s possible. But at the same time, Mr Johnson hasn’t even triggered his Plan B, let alone full lockdown. It seems likely his warnings are at least partly designed to push people into getting their booster. What is England’s Covid ‘Plan B’  A -page plan spells out a ‘Plan B’ for Englandthe virus surges. It includes bringing back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. Which settings would only be decided at the time but they’d likely include public transport, shops and supermarkets. Separately, schools have a “contingency framework” forthe virus surges locally. That includes compulsory masks in secondary classrooms. Plan B also involves forcing punters to show they’ve been fully-vaccinated using the NHS Covid pass - before entering all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. It’d also include indoor, crowded settings with  or more people outdoor, crowded settings with , or more people and any settings with , or more attendees, like Premier League football and stadium gigs. Lastly, Plan B would also see the government “consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. And ministers will “communicate clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously” - which arguably is already happening.  How is Plan B dferent from a lockdown  Plan B stops far, far short of the lockdown rules that last afflicted England in early .Those included forcing people by law to stay at home apart from for a limited number of reasons, such as going out for exercise or medical appointments. Shielding resumed, pubs and restaurants shut, takeaway pints were banned, schools were shut for months, and meetings between people from dferent households or bubbles were outlawed.Millions of workers were put on furlough, with the government paying up to % of their wages at a cost of billions of pounds per week. All these measures remain so far in reserve that the government dare not even speak their name - they do not feature in the Plan B document. When could Plan B happen  We cannot say “when” Plan B would happen exactly, and many experts have called for it to be triggered already.But we can say what the criteria for triggering it are. Key questions for triggering Plan B include:Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed  This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions. The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital. Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s is under way but was not as quick as ministers hoped. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme. The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Why hasn’t Boris Johnson triggered Plan B yet  The Prime Minister has effectively made a political choice that, because the rate of new cases isn’t soaring the NHS isn’t yet “overwhelmed”, , deaths a week are a price worth paying for a le without Plan B restrictions. He said this week: “We donapost see anything in the data at the moment to suggest that we need to go to Plan B. Weaposre sticking with Plan A.” Organisations including doctors’ and NHS groups have argued the health service is, in fact, close to breaking point due to the backlog of elective care. Critics argue the Prime Minister should have drawn the line in a dferent place and triggered Plan B at an earlier stage. What’s happening with booster vaccines  Booster jabs will be rolled out to people under . People aged  to -years-old are to be offered another dose of the vaccine to boost their immunity and limit transmission of the virus. Over-s and vulnerable groups could already get a booster, six months or more after their second dose. A booking can be got in the diary after a five month gap. While healthy under-s are not being offered a booster for now, the JCVI watchdog will make a decision on this when more data is available. The vaccine experts also announced new advice for  to -year-olds, who will now be told to get a second dose  weeks after their first. Will I have to get a booster for foreign travel  Quite possibly, yes. Holidaymakers can use the NHS Covid pass to prove they are fully vaccinated, allowing them to avoid quarantine rules in most countries. But the Government has been hinting that people will soon need to prove theyaposve had a booster - a third dose - to be considered fully jabbed. Boris Johnson said: I think that we will be making plans to add the booster to the NHS Covid travel pass. But again, I think what the general lesson is,anybody wants to travel, you can see that getting fully vaccinated with a booster is going to be something that will - on the whole - make your le easier in all kinds of ways including for foreign travel. So I would just say, you know,youaposre thinking about that, then this is yet another reason to get it done. The PM added: On boosters, itaposs very clear that getting three jabs - getting your booster - will become an important fact and it will make le easier for you in all sorts of ways, and we will have to adjust our concept of what constitutes a full vaccination to take account of that.

More than , incidents were reported to the police in  Image: SWNSByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | comments A new criminal offence that will put people who steal beloved family pets behind bars has been published by the Government today.The dog abduction offence, first announced in September, will be added to the Kept Animals Bill currently making its way through the Commons. Boris Johnson, who owns a male Jack Russell cross called Dilyn with we Carrie, promised a ruthless crackdown on dognapping earlier this year leading to the launch of a pet theft task force.People who steal a canine companion could face up to five years in jailconvicted of dog abduction, under Government plans.In an apparent crackdown on the crime, judges will be able to give more targeted penalties and sentences by taking into account the emotional distress caused to both the owner and the dog.Previously, pet theft was treated as a loss of property to the owner, putting it on a par with shop-lting.It follows a reported rise in pet thefts during the pandemic, with more than , incidents reported to the police last year, causing considerable distress for owners and their pets alike.And the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairshas said around seven in  crimes involving animals, refer to dogs.Environment Secretary George Eustice said: The loss of a much-loved pet causes unique distress. I am pleased that we are legislating to recognise this specic crime.The new dog abduction offence will reflect the impact on animals in penalties for criminals, and deliver justice for victims.Chief veterinary officer Dr Christine Middlemiss said the latest move is an important step forward with dogs being treated as sentient beings rather than merely property.She added: The new offence should build greater awareness of the signicant impacts of dog theft on people and animals, and reassure pet owners that these crimes are being taken seriously.David Bowles, head of public affairs at the RSPCA, said pet theft is devastating for owners, adding that he hopes the offence will act as a real deterrent to those who carry out this crime.Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust, said: Having your beloved pet stolen is an extremely stressful, often heart-breaking experience.For years, Dogs Trust has called for harsher penalties to deter those who profit from this despicable crime.We wholeheartedly welcome the measures the Government has taken today to tackle pet theft and prioritise the welfare of our pets as sentient beings, and very much hope that the increased sentencing will make pet thieves think twice.Comment MORE ON David BowlesJack RussellBoris JohnsonRSPCACrimePoliticsAnimalsCoronavirusTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They say Jobcentre chiefs should impose inspections on , people who made new claims in the pandemic, but whose cases had ended by January this year. It could see officials trying to claw money back from some Brits who fell on hard times a year ago. Since January the Department for Work and Pensionshas been reviewing , cases it deemed “at particular risk of fraud or error”, after relaxing identity checks during the pandemic. Some of those reviews prompted a backlash, as families were told to hold up a copy of that day’s newspaper. About % of the , cases had errors. But the cross-party PAC today claims that exercise did not go far enough - and , extra people should be subjected to retrospective checks in the next nine months. They are people who made new claims during Covid but whose claims ended by January . The committee argued the DWP had “lost a grip” of fraud and error in Universal Credit and was “taken by surprise” by the extent of fraud in the pandemic.UC overpayments due to “fraud and error” - which includes mistakes made by the DWP - rose to £.bn in  , or .% of UC spending. The DWP aims to cut this to .% but is “unable to show how it expects to achieve the reduction and does not currently have the necessary plan or resources to achieve it,” PAC said. The MPs said billions in taxpayers’ money “is almost certainly lost” - while state pensioners were underpaid for years. PAC chair Meg Hillier added: “This is a real-le waking nightmare for the huge numbers of people affected, from the most vulnerable in our society to the full-time working families who still struggle daily to make ends meet.  “The Department appears unequipped either to properly administer our labyrinthine benefits system or detect and correct years of mistakes.” It came as new figures yesterday showed one in four children in Britain are living in households hit by the £-a-week Universal Credit cut. More than . million children and young people were living in households receiving UC before the £ uplt was removed in October. There were . million people on UC on October , down , from July .Dan Paskins of Save The Children said parents are constantly worried about food and bills while kids are missing school trips - despite a Budget change to make UC more generous for workers.He said: We welcomed the Governmentaposs adjustments to Universal Credit in the Budget. But allowing some people to keep more of their income is not a replacement for a strong social safety net that protects everyone in our society. Ministers must do more to protect children across the UK from cold and hunger this winter. A government spokesperson said: “It is disappointing that the Public Accounts Committee has failed to acknowledge that in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic, we prioritised supporting record numbers of genuine claimants. “Thanks to this decision, the Universal Credit system stood up to the challenge of the pandemic so people received vital financial support at their time of need. “We are now taking extensive action to ensure all claims made were genuine. “Fraud and error in the benefit system is rare, with % of benefits worth more than £bn paid correctly, and just .% of benefits being overpaid due to DWP error.” Comment MORE ON Save the ChildrenDepartment for Work and PensionsMeg HillierFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In a damning report published last November, then independent standards adviser Sir Alex Allan found the Home Secretary had broken the ministerial code, which included shouting and swearing at her staff. The Prime Minister decided to overrule Sir Alexaposs advice, leading to the ethics chiefaposs resignation instead. Breaching the rules would normally lead to a minister resigning their post. The FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, has brought a judicial review of his decision, probing the legal status of the ministerial code. In written submissions, Sir James Eadie QC, for the Prime Minister, argued the Prime Minister’s decision “was a matter of judgment for him having regard to the nature of the code, his s under it, and all the circumstances of the case”.  He said the ministerial code “does not create or impose any legal duties on ministers or the Prime Minister” and is “not required by law” and its contents “not regulated by law”. But lawyers for the union, which represents senior public servants, argue Mr Johnson made a “misdirection of law” when he went against the findings of his adviser on ministerial standards in order to back Ms Patel. Tom Hickman said: “We say on any fair reading of those words the Prime Minister must have considered that where conduct which otherwise amounts to bullying is inadvertent or that the person is unaware of the distress and upset caused then that is an excuse, a reason why it does not constitute bullying. We say that is a misdirection of law.” Following the publication of his report, Ms Patel issued an “unreserved, fulsome apology” and said there were “no excuses” for what happened. The FDA’s case, being heard by Lord Justice Lewis and Mrs Justice Steyn at the Royal Courts of Justice, continues.

People who arrive on British beaches in small boats would be taken to the country within a week for “offshore processing”, it is reported. There are “discreet talks” with the country’s government to establish an asylum centre in Albania, although one source described these as “early days”, according to The Times.Justice Secretary, former Foreign Secretary and Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab appeared to confirmed talks were under way.He told Sky News: “I think it’s right there’s practice around the world around this to look at least at the possibilities of international partnerships, for international processing of some of these claims.” AskedAlbania could be a site for the processing he replied: “That’s one country. “But as Foreign Secretary we were willing to look with partners at whether it’s possible to do this international processing.” Shadow Home Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds hit back: “Instead of chasing headlines about unconscionable offshore processing, the Government should address its own failures.  There is no effective deal in place with the French Authorities, and, instead of providing properly managed safe and legal routes, the Government closed the Dubs Scheme that helped unaccompanied children. The Government’s incompetence is dangerous, with ever-increasing numbers of people risking their lives in the English Channel.” Mr Raab went on: “The point is, as well as focusing on regional processing which is probably the best way, the optimum way of dealing with refugees, as close to source as possible, better for them - but also we want to look with international partners at how we reduce the pull factor.” He later told Times Radio: “Forgive me not commenting on the inidual countries. A lot of these discussions are at preliminary stage. It is much more than just one partner and weaposre not the only country that is facing this challenge.” Home Secretary Priti Patel has repeatedly been accused of hardline plans to deal with the thousands of desperate people who cross the Channel. But she has clashed with research with contradicts her claims that the majority of those crossing from France are not “genuine” asylum seekers. And a minister yesterday admitted only five migrants who crossed the Channel by boat to the UK have been ed to Europe so far this year. More than , people have arrived in the UK this year after crossing the Channel in small boats. This is almost three times the total of around , in . A Home Office spokesperson said: “Migrants making these dangerous crossings are putting their lives at risk and it is vital we do everything we can to prevent them and break the business model of the criminal gangs exploiting people. “People should claim asylum in the first safe country they arrive in, and as part of our response it is important we have a maritime deterrent in the channel and work with international partners to put an end to these dangerous journeys.”  Meanwhile, France has rejected a British claim that Priti Patel and her counterpart Gerald Darmanin agreed to work to prevent % of crossings of the English Channel. The Home Office issued a joint statement from the pair which said they had agreed measures to stop the dangerous crossings of the deadly route. But the French embassy in London said the % figure should not be presented as an agreed figure. Ms Patel and Mr Darmanin held talks on Monday night with the UK and France involved in a long-running row over how to address the problem of migrants seeking to cross the Channel. The joint statement issued afterwards said: Both the Home Secretary and interior minister agreed to strengthen operational cooperation further. More must be done to stop the dangerous crossings. They agreed to accelerate the delivery of the commitments made in the joint agreement of July  to deliver on their joint determination to prevent % of crossings and make this deadly route unviable.But the French embassy said on Twitter : For the record, the % figure was not agreed between the Home Secretary and French interior minister GDarmanin and should not be presented as an agreed commitment: it is not.And it is not part of the joint statement.

But Ms Dorries wrote: “Laura, I very much like and respect you, but we both know, that text is ridiculous. “Although nowhere near as ridiculous as the person - obviously totally desperate for your attention - who sent it”.  Askedshe sent the tweet publicly in error or why she deleted it, a source close to Ms Dorries declined to comment. Former London mayor candidate Siobhan Benita tweeted: “Nadine Dorries is not fit to be Culture Secretary.” Labour MP Karl Turner said: “Sec of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport publically [sic] tells off @bbclaurak for having the audacity to report Johnson’s terrible state today and then quickly deletes the tweet.”Twitter pundit James Felton added: “You know being Secretary of State for Culture, Media  Sport doesn’t mean you’re the boss of journalism right.” The Culture Secretary has a long history of eyebrow-raising tweets about the BBC and to journalists, among many other issues. In  she suggested ministers should withhold the licence fee payout at a round of negotiations, unless they did more to address discrimination.

The cost of living has already surged to . per cent in October up from . per cent the previous month, the Office for National Statistics [ONS] has said.The figure is more than double the Bank of Englandaposs target rate of  per cent, and is based on the consumer Prices Indexmeasure of inflation.The ONS said the rise was driven by rocketing energy bills after a % leap in wholesale costs. Second-hand cars and the cost of eating out also accounted for the steep rise. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeve said alone it will leave households more than £, worse off - or £ a week over a year.  But reports in the Daily Mail claim that the cost to the wallet could be double that, with tax hikes looming as well as a potential interest rate rise. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was said to have calculated that an employee on a salary of £, would be about £, worse off in real terms by the end of next year. And a rise in interest rates from . per cent to . per cent could add about £ to a £,, it has been reported. Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said: Inflation rose steeply in October to its highest rate in nearly a decade. This was driven by increased household energy bills due to the price cap hike, a rise in the cost of second-hand cars and fuel as well as higher prices in restaurants and hotels. Costs of goods produced by factories and the price of raw materials have also risen substantially and are now at their highest rates for at least  years. Last week the Bank of England made the decision to hold interest rates at record lows despite warnings the cost of living was spiralling out of control. But the Bank said a rate increase was on the way as it warned gas and electricity tarf increases will see CPI leap to around % next April.  Tax hikes are also due to come into force in April, chiefly a rise in national insurance to pay for extra spending on health and social care. Kevin Brown, a savings specialist at investment firm Scottish Friendly, said: Inflation is now at its highest level for ten years and is set to carry on rising into next year. Many younger families in particular will have little experience of dealing with such sharp price rises and, with Christmas on the horizon, plus tax hikes due in April, it could be a challenging time financially for a lot of them.From universal credit to furlough, employment rights, travel updates and emergency financial aid - weaposve got all of the big financial stories you need to know about right now.  to our Mirror Money newsletter here.  It also seems highly likely that the Bank of England will raise interest rates at the next opportunity so households should also be prepared for mortgage costs and other loan repayments to go up. There have also been warnings that new council tax bills could rise in April. Heidi Karjalainen, a research economist, said wages would need to increase aposat a rapid paceapos for people to maintain their standard of living. She added that the squeeze on household budgets would be felt across families with a range of incomes.

Stuart Hill, , and Jason Hill, , died in the smash in the Grand Canyon in February  after a gust of wind knocked the aircraft off course. Stuartaposs girlfriend Becky Dobson, , and honeymooners Eleanor,  and Jonathan Udall, , were also killed in the incident in the US.Jasonaposs girlfriend Jenner Dorricott survived the crash but suffered le-changing injuries, Sussex Live reports. Pilot Scott Booth also survived but had both his legs amputated.  Crawley Coroneraposs Court heard that after hitting the ground the helicopter became a fireball and caused serious burns to the victims, who had all been on a tour of the National Park. The coroner ruled the burns caused their deaths. The families of the victims are now facing a letime coming to terms with their loss. Stuart and Jasonaposs parents made an emotional statement during the Inquest, saying they have been left living in another world where we will never be truly happy again. Their mother Sandra said: We represent every parent’s nightmare because suddenly we cease to be mum and dad. Because there is nobody left for us to care for.  Jason went to university to study law and then committed himself to a career he was so passionate about. He qualied and became an associate solicitor and at the time of this tragedy had just received the news he was to become the youngest ever partner at that firm. He never got to realise that. Stuart was more practical and chose to broaden his horizons by travelling to New Zealand for  months. Our boys made us proud and as they settled in adulthood we still did many things together. I cannot go into a card shop and pass any cards with the word son on it without coming out in a panic, and I havenapost been able to put up a Christmas tree. We have been left living in another world where we will never be truly happy again. Our sons should have lived long lives. Their father Reverend David Hill quoted a line from the Fast and Furious movie series to explain the brotheraposs relationship, telling the court: No matter where you are, whether itaposs a quarter-mile away or halfway across the world, youaposll always be with me and youaposll always be my brother. He added: They were inseparable and they are today.  The group, from Worthing, had taken a tour to celebrate Stuartaposs th birthday at the time of the crash. Crawley Coroner’s Court heard car salesman Stuart, solicitor Jason and veterinary nurse Becky were all pronounced dead at the scene while Eleanor and Jonathan were able to pull themselves out the wreckage. Paying tribute to her daughter, Beckyaposs mum Jane said: Our beautul Becky, we miss you so much, you were such an amazing daughter. Your radiant smile would light up every room. Your lovely funny ways would always make us laugh. Our lives will never be the same, but Becky you will always stay with us in your hearts forever. Several members of the Australian Airforce and a nurse attended the scene as they had been on other tours when the crash happened. It took hours for rescuers to reach the site of the crash due to the dficult terrain, the court was told, with emergency crews only being able to airlt them away six hours after the initial crash.  During the rescue mission Eleanor was taken away from her husband as rescuers feared he may be dying, and she asked one of the crew to tell Jonathan she loved him. They died in hospital two weeks later. Eleanoraposs parents Maggie and Terry Milward said: Ellie was a wonderful, loyal and hardworking colleague, a caring friend and godmother, charity worker and supporter, devoted we, sister and daughter. The loss to our family cannot be put into words. We take comfort from the bravery and selflessness of those who went to aid in the canyon and all the hospital staff who did all they could to save our darling girl and support us through those desperate days. Jonathanaposs parents Philip and Marlene Udall said: Jonathan was a compassionate, kind and caring person, a young man with his whole le ahead of him. We hold on tightly to the precious memories we have of watching Jonathan develop into this amazing young man. To now face every day without him in our lives is unbearable knowing we will never again see Jonaposs smiling face, to hug him, to never again hear his wonderful laugh.

Lisa Riley SAYS her child Layla Fielding has been left without a proper education since year three when she was expelled. But the Bury council has refuted these claims, saying Layla has always had a school place but her mother has deemed it to be unsuitable.Layla, from Bury, has special educational needs, with Lisa telling the Manchester Evening News she has ADHD, sensory processing disorder and anxiety.In the past when she has felt overwhelmed, Layla has run out of the classroom - even managing to escape school premises altogether. It has been three years since Layla has had any regular classroom time, with Lisa giving up work to stay at home with her daughter - who has been struggling with loneliness.  I think Iaposve missed out on a lot by not going to school. Iaposve been missing out on learning, socialising and everything like that, Layla told the MEN. The lack of classroom time has had a devastating effect on her and her family, and Lisa has hit out at Bury Council for failing to find her a suitable spot. Weaposre at a stage where I feel like Iaposve got to shout out to get heard for my little girl, Lisa Riley said. Layla has told her mum: I feel like I havenapost got any friends now and I feel lonely sometimes. Layla did attend St.Joseph  St.Bedeaposs for a few weeks in the January after she was excluded from a school in Rochdale. But her mother says her flight or fight response was triggered - and she once again managed to escape the school grounds. Lisa added: It was the same scenario, Layla couldnapost cope.  Layla now sees an alternative education provider, but this is only for three two hours sessions a week, and Lisa said it is aposno substitute for the formal education her daughter deservesapos. She fears that Layla, who she says is bright and intelligent, is years behind in her learning - especially as she should be set to start secondary school in September. With the right support in place, and with staff made aware of Laylaaposs sensory issues, Lisa believes sheaposd be more than capable of having a formal education in a normal school. She said: Almost three years in, we need a suitable place for Layla to attend. And itaposs not just the academic le and learning, itaposs the social, the emotional, making friends, feeling part of a group and community that Layla is missing out on and has missed out on. And really I just find it staggering to think the council canapost accommodate or find one single place to suit Layla. My daughter deserves better than the council are delivering for her. Bury Council told the MEN Layla has had a school place for the past three years - although it had been deemed unsuitable by her mother. A spokesperson said: We always strive to ensure that all children, whatever their circumstances, are provided with the education that is most appropriate for them and in the right setting. “We have worked extensively with Ms Riley over many months to find the solution that is best for her and her daughter. At all times Layla has had a school place. “Following her exclusion, a place for Layla was provided at a primary school in Bury in . To support her successful reintegration into school a plan was agreed with a part-time in school and with specialist part-time provision off-site, however as this broke down the school moved to providing full-time offsite provision. “In January , the council agreed to fund full-time provision with an approved alternative provider to continue to work with Layla and reintegrate her back into her school environment. Her mainstream school found it challenging to meet Laylaaposs needs, but Ms Riley was of the view that a school had to be a mainstream school and special provision would not be considered. Unfortunately, this has delayed reaching an alternative arrangement for Layla. “Layla has a place at her primary school and is currently being provided with education offsite with an approved alternative provider as Layla has struggled to adapt to her school environment. “We are consulting with a range of primary mainstream schools and considering specialist provision alongside these options in order to identy the most suitable setting for Layla.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON EducationSchoolsSecondary schoolADHD\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The plasterers got her out of the home, which was engulfed by flames minutes later.Do you have a similar story  Email webnews@mirror.James said: “It was black with smoke, you couldn’t see anything except the red glow from the fire. “We could hear someone talking in the living room... then we found this frail old lady sitting on a chair. She was confused and wasn’t aware [of] the severity of the fire. We managed to get her out just in time, as we’d only been in there a minute or two and we could barely breathe.  “Her hair was singed and her hands all burnt and she was bleeding. It was absolutely horrible to see.” James, from Wrexham, North Wales, added: “The place has been completely destroyed. If she had been left in there two minutes longer she would be dead.” The plasterers also helped a woman down the steps as she made her way out of the back door. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information and changes at www.mirror email .Matthew said another heroic member of the public rescued a man from the burning home.

The near m-long trawler, called the Svanic, was intercepted by UK Border Force vessels in the North Sea late on November  last year and was escorted into Harwich in Essex. The boat, built almost  years ago, had been heading towards Great Yarmouth in Norfolk after it set sail from the Ostend area of Belgium. Tony Badenoch QC, prosecuting, told a trial at Chelmsford Crown Court that after it was seized the Svanic was inspected and it displayed a multitude of faults. As an example, it only had a maximum lesaving capacity of  persons, he said, saying there were  lejackets for  people on board.  Latvian national Aleksandrs Gulpe, , and -year-old Ukrainian national Igor Kosyi were both found guilty of conspiring to assist unlawful immigration, with Gulpe by a unanimous verdict and Kosyi by a majority verdict of  jurors to two, a court official said. Both men were described by prosecutors as crew members, who were arrested when the boat reached land in the early hours of November . Kfir Ivgi, , of Corrigan Close, Finchley, and Sergejs Kuliss, , of Albert Basin Way, Newham, London were both found guilty by unanimous verdicts, a court official said. Prosecutors described them as UK-based organisers.  Arturas Jusas, , of Wandsworth Road, Lambeth, also described as a UK-based organiser, admitted at an earlier hearing to conspiring to assist unlawful immigration. A sixth man, Ukrainian national Volodymyr Mykhailov, , who the court heard was arrested when the boat reached land, was cleared. All six defendants had been charged with conspiring to assist unlawful immigration between September   and November  .  Earlier in the trial, jurors were played an audio file from a mobile phone from September   in which Jusas said: Weaposre going to bring every week  people, yes, we need to invest now ,,you want,  you,  me. From first trip weaposre going to get the money back. Mr Badenoch said: A single trip was therefore capable of ing , at the very least on the interpretation of that message. The National Crime Agencyaposs director of investigations, Nikki Holland said, afterwards: There is no stronger example of how organised criminals are prepared to risk the lives of the people they smuggle for profit. The Svanic was in an appalling condition, and in no fit state to make the perilous journey from Belgium to the UK. Had it got into trouble, the consequences could have been fatal as there was only one leboat and  lejackets. The dangers wouldnapost have crossed the minds of these men, whose sole motive was to line their pockets.  They were planning to use this death trap over and over again. The five men who were convicted of the charge are to be sentenced on a date to be fixed.

Late-night emails, client WhatsApps, the news, a Twitter notication, FitBit… it didn’t matter what it was. What mattered is that I was immediately available or I’d miss something transformative, I was sure of it. I’d sit at dinner, discussing a friend’s hilariously bad date, missing cues to laugh as I was too busy urging myself not to glance down at my lit up screen. I’d sit at my desk, unable to focus, being pulled out of concentration by the incessant glow. I had reached such a heightened level of contact with the outside world that I didn’t even notice how badly I needed to disconnect. One day, after a long, hard think about this habit, I did something I never thought would actually stick: I turned every single notication off.You’d think I’d be the last person on earth to actually manage this, or I certainly did anyway. I had founded amarketing agencyin the year prior. I had clients, a small team, umpteen social media accounts to manage, inquiring journalists, potential business popping up and I really believed this demanded me to be non-negotiably on, all the time. Would you ever go cold turkey on your phone notications  Have your say in the comments below Fast forward six months, I now find it incredibly odd to imagine my phone holding that much power over me. I’ve turned off every single notication, I don’t open the email app out-of-hours, and I’ve turned off the banner and badge alerts for most apps too. Nothing, except urgent phone calls, has lit up my phone for over half a year. The first two weeks were uncomfortably dficult. When you get a notication, it triggers a dopamine rush, and my own brain was addicted to this “reward”, craving the habit-based behaviour. I felt anxious for a while, semi-desperately telling everyone about it, making sure they knew to call they needed me.After that  Peace. There’s been a million ways this has benefited me in every aspect of my le but perhaps most importantly, I am able to be present, no matter where I am. Whether it’s getting my head down to plan a brand launch strategy or at the dinner table discussing future travel plans. Either way, I am finally living in the moment. People rarely call, and this always surprises me. Both my colleagues and I have realised that we believe everything is urgent, until we’re forced to decideit’s worth interrupting someone... and it often turns out, it’s just not. Clients follow the same logic. I’m a big fan of that. I can’t think of one single moment or opportunity I have missed because of this. Everyone, both professionally and personally, has better boundaries with me now. Our clients rarely WhatsApp, butand when they do, I still won’t reply out of working hours, unless itaposs an emergency - which is almost never. My friends know I’ll reply when I can , but they also know when I’m with them, I’m now both physically and mentally present. As a society, we have a painful and damaging relationship with technology, and an ever-growing notion that with all this wonderful tech, we should be far more connected than ever before. It’s undeniable that we’re privileged to have this access. But at the same time, being instantly available to everyone and anything is simply not healthy.My current wellbeing is testament to that. I used to feel anxious and overwhelmed, and while this might not be the only change I made to lessen that, it’s certainly one of the biggest. It’s liberating. I’ve learnt that you don’t ever need to apologise for being unavailable. You don’t need to give anyone that instant access to you. You don’t need to be actively busy to not respond - you’re entitled to be actively not-busy and still unavailable. Those boundaries are healthy and should become society’s norm. And I truly believe,you challenge yourself to three weeks, this will become your norm too.

Health officials say current case rates of myocarditis after vaccination among under s are around nine per million vaccinations and cases have been “relatively mild”. However the -week rule will lead to signicant delays in rolling out the vaccine programme among children.Around half of school children have had Covid- and yesterday’s REACT- study showed one in  pupils were infected between October  and November .  The current advice for older people and for people at high risk of Covid- - including those aged  and over - is that they should wait four weeks between Covid infection and having a dose of vaccine. But officials said this should be extended to  weeks in lower-risk children between  and . The guidance comes amid high infection rates among younger age groups. It is thought that a natural Covid- infection in younger people provides them with “at least” three months’ protection and could extend to six months. On Monday, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationsaid  and -year-olds could book their second Covid- vaccine  weeks after their first. But the UKHSA said that should teenagers in this age group be infected with Covid- after their first dose, they should then delay the second dose until  weeks after the infection.

Hero taxi driver David Perry had a miracle escape after a home-made device strapped to his passenger Emad Jamil Al Swealmeen - who changed his name to Enzo Almeni - exploded in the back of his cab outside the hospital on Sunday.Chilling shop CCTV footage has been published by the Liverpool Echo showing the final journey of Almeni on his way to sow terror at the hospital.This comes after a source close to the driver told the Mirror the bomber only spoke two words - “Women’s hospital” - after he was picked up for the seven minute car journey shortly before am on Remembrance Sunday.  He didn’t say another word all the way there. The driver was not aware of anything” said the source. He said David was briefly knocked out by the force of the blast, which blew out his windscreen and sent shards of glass and metal spiralling in the air. The source added: “He woke up leaning on the steering wheel. He was trapped and then saw flames coming through the two seats. “He couldn’t get his seatbelt off so had to climb out of it.”  David was able to scramble free seconds before his car was engulfed by flames with Almeni still inside. His we said later her husband was saved by “ angels”. The Liverpool Echo learned that Mr Perryaposs taxi travelled along Lodge Lane on its way to the Crown Street site, and was captured by cameras at The Green Mountain Food Store, by the junction with Tagus Street. Manager Naz Al-Asadi, , told them: The police came in around pm yesterday, they said to me can we check the CCTV. I said yes, we should work together as this is something not good at all, this is very, very bad. They knew the time and they took a copy. It is very horrible, very very bad. I just want to know what was going on with this guy, it is not normal.  Four men arrested in relation to the explosion outside the Womenaposs Hospital in Liverpool on Sunday  November have now been released from custody following interview. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, said in an update on Monday: Following interviews with the arrested men, we are satisfied with the accounts they have provided and they have been released from police custody. The investigation continues to move at a fast pace with investigative teams working throughout the night. We have made signicant progress since Sunday morning and have a much greater understanding of the component parts of the device, how they were obtained and how the parts are likely to have been assembled. We have also recovered important evidence from the address at Rutland Avenue which is becoming central to the investigation.  There is a considerable way to go to understand how this incident was planned, prepared for and how it happened. We are gaining a better understanding by the hour but it is likely to be some time, perhaps many weeks until we are confident on our understanding of what has taken place. In the meantime, we have considerable resources and staff deployed to understand how this device was built and whoanyone  was involved. If the evidence takes us to the involvement of others, further arrests will quickly take place. Anyone who has any information should call on    quoting Liverpool Womens Hospital incident.

Christian convert Emad Al Swealmeen, , spent months building up a supply of dangerous chemicals at a rented flat in the city, where he is believed to have attempted to make multiple explosives. He was the only person killed as his bomb detonated in a taxi outside Liverpool Womenaposs Hospital on Sunday morning. Counter-terrorism sources told The Times that he attempted to construct a device using primary and secondary explosives to magny the blast. Similar bombs were used during the  attack on the London tube, when four al-Qaeda inspired terrorists killed  innocent people in simultaneous attacks in the capital. Yesterday streets around Al Swealmeenaposs flat were cordoned off after a package was discovered, with bomb disposal officers called to the scene.  Do you know anything about this incident  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorAssistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said Iraq-born Al Swealmeen had rented the home seven months ago and had started making relevant purchases for his homemade bomb at least since that time. Mr Jackson said several suspicious packages were found, and were examined by explosive ordinance disposalofficers before being recovered by forensic teams. The cordon was removed from Boaler Street yesterday evening, but Mr Jackson said the public may still see EOD officers in the area on Thursday in case further items are found. Searches have also been carried out at a property in Rutland Avenue that had been rented by Al Swealmeen since April, and that is the main focus of the police investigation. Earlier, Mr Jackson said: A complex picture is emerging over the purchases of the component parts of the device, we know that Al Swealmeen rented the property from April this year and we believe relevant purchases have been made at least since that time.  We have now traced a next of kin for Al Swealmeen who has informed us that he was born in Iraq. No evidence of terrorist ideology has yet been discovered, it is understood. Mr Jackson said the bomber had suffered from periods of mental illness that will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand. Mr Jackson added: There is much comment in the media about Al Swealmeen and it is clear that he was known to many people. We continue to appeal for people who knew him, especially those who associated with him this year as we try and piece together the events leading up to this incident and the reasons for it. At this time we are not finding any link to others in the Merseyside area of concern but this remains a fast moving investigation and as more becomes known we cannot rule out action against others. Last night The Mirror reported the cabbie who survived the Liverpool bomb attack told rescuers: “Someone has blown me up.”Security guard Darren Knowles raced to help David Perry after terrorist Al Swealmeen set off his bomb. He said: “I just grabbed him and tried to get him to safety.” Brave security guard Darren desperately tried to find outthere was anyone  who could be saved as he helped David, the taxi driver whose cab exploded at a Liverpool hospital. Reliving the horror of the Remembrance Day bomb blast, Mr Knowles, , told how the driver stumbled from his taxi, blood pouring from his ear and neck, screaming, “I want my we”.

It is the second major interview that Meghan has made since she and Harry moved to the US last year, with her being highly critical of the Royal Family during the chat with Oprah Winfrey. But in a brief clip of her interview with long-term friend Ellen the conversation centred around her new le and also how dficult it was for her starting out as an actress. She said she was looking for “anything to relieve” Lilibet’s teething pain and Ellen replied: “Tequila, anything.”  Meghan replied: “That’s Auntie Ellen for you” and the talk show host accepted: “That’s why I don’t have kids.” Talking about living at their Montecito mansion, Meghan admitted that the Sussexes were “just happy” with le. Since moving to the US, Harry and Meghan have taken aim at the Royal Family in several interviews for the le they lead and the way that Meghan was treated. In the Oprah interview, Meghan alleged racism against one of the royals who questioned what the colour would be of her first baby and that she had “suicidal thoughts” due to her unhappiness in England.  Harry also said that he realised he needed to break the cycle of le in the Royal Family and bring up his children in a dferent environment. But while Buckingham Palace may have been worried whether Meghan would make fresh allegations, instead the interview clip with Ellen centred on other topics. Meghan’s makeup artist Daniel Martin said the interview looked at her “funny side”. He said: We [he and hairstylist Jason Low] were backstage the entire time,apos he said. aposItaposs really fun and Ellen really pulled out Meghanaposs goofy, funny side, which everyone will be able to finally see. The clip that again hinted at Meghan’s alleged financial troubles when she started out her acting career, which may well be jumped on as she was still able to go through private school paid for by her dad Thomas Markle. Meghan has also posted on social media in the past about at dining regularly at expensive restaurants in Hollywood including Musso and Frank Grill. She told Ellen: “So I had this very old Ford Explore Sport and at a certain point the key stopped working on the driveraposs side, so you couldnapost get yourself in through the door so after auditions I would park at the back of the parking lot and I would open the trunk and climb in, pull the door shut behind me and crawl all over my seats to get out. Thataposs how I would come to and fro.” Meghan added: I would park on gate three and I would scoot on over and the security guards here would always say aposbreak a leg, I hope you get itapos. So driving today was very dferent.

Jaz Smith needed to give birth to her daughter  weeks early as her liver was starting to fail and it was thanks to the work of doctors and nurses at Diana, Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby that they both survived.Ayla-Grace was born weighing lb oz on April  despite having been given a due date of August , reported WalesOnline.No blood was flowing to the baby forcing a premature birth and then further complications saw Ayla-Grace born with the cord wrapped around her neck four times over. She later required heart surgery within the first few months of her le and still requires oxygen today, but her mum says she is absolutely thriving now. Jaz said she knew something was wrong when she started experiencing swelling. I was told it was too early to be pre-eclampsia by the doctors as I was only  weeks gone. And then the week after I rung the hospital again because my swelling just wouldn’t go down, she said. I was then admitted at  weeks and was in hospital for a week. For me that was the hardest time because I wasn’t allowed to see my eldest son who was only three-years-old. I really struggled being away from him. Jaz was eventually diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and recalled how much pain she was in. She said: My test results came back that I had pre-eclampsia and I was going to hit full blown eclampsia mode within seven to ten days. I begged the doctors to let me out and come in for daily checks but they kept me in one more night and that’s when my world got turned upside down.  I was terried and all I remember thinking was - aposI never thought this would happen to meapos. But when it does, it’s the most scariest thing in the world. Things then took a turn for the worse. I had three doctors in my room at am in the morning listening to my daughteraposs heartbeat and they brought a sonographer in to check her, Jaz said. In the process of that we found out that my liver was failing and I’d had a placental abruption - a serious condition in which the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus before birth. My daughter had no blood flow and they’d said it had been like that for a good few days. They then told me thatwe didn’t get her out soon, then she wouldnapost make it and neither would I. When my daughter was born, she had the cord wrapped round her neck four times over and it took more then one doctor to get it off her.  Ayla-Grace was taken to Hullaposs neonatal unit where she spent six days before being transferred to Scunthorpe General Hospital for another three weeks. In a traumatic period for the family she was then moved back to the Diana Princess of Wales Hospital where her mum found out she needed major surgery. Jaz said: Within the first few months of her short le, she underwent open heart surgery which was extremely traumatic. I was told she had a hole in her heart that didn’t close properly. She also has chronic lung disease, the long-term lung damage, due to being born so early. She still requires oxygen today but she is absolutely thriving. The experience of having a premature baby, whether it is four weeks or  weeks, is absolutely heartbreaking. Itaposs the most scariest thing to ever go through, especially when you have other children as well. Premature babies are little miracles and they really do just thrive off le. My baby girl is nearly seven months old now and I feel incredibly lucky to have her in my le.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have reportedly been invited to join the rest of the royals at Sandringham.It would be the first chance for royal family to make Lilibet, the Queenaposs namesake great-granddaughter who the couple welcomed in June. The Queen has faced a number of health concerns in recent weeks, after being hospitalised for a night in October and then having to cancel her appearance at the Remembrance Day service in Westminster after spraining her back.But a source told Page Six : “There’s a lot that goes into the logistics and the planning of the family Christmas, so of course, staff know that Harry and Meghan are not coming. “If they were, they would have communicated it to their family by now. “But this is Her Majesty’s first Christmas without her husband, so one would have hoped they would want to be with her.” The Sussexes have not commented on the claims. The Queen is often joined at Sandringham by her family, where they celebrate the festive season and attend the annual local church service.Her Majesty was pictured carrying out an engagement today for the first time in almost a month as she has faced a bout of ill health and injury.She held a face to face audience with Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week but was not pictured doing so. This comes after the Queen yesterday said None of us can slow the passage of time in a poignant message to the General Synod given by Prince Edward in her absence due to illness. The -year-old monarch reminisced about her late husband Prince Philip, remarking how it has been half a century since they together attended the very first meeting of the General Synod. The claims about the Sussexes not attending Christmas come as Meghan is set to give another bombshell TV interview on The Ellen Show - and a teaser clip of her chat has been released. Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres confirmed Meghan would be appearing on her show on her official Twitter account.Tweeting a teaser clip of the interview, Ellen wrote: A lot has changed since the last time Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex, was on the Warner Brothers lot.

She speaks about the Ford Explorer she used to drive, which had a key that often stopped working meaning she had to climb into the car through the boot. Meghan also jokes about how when she was an actress, the security guards at the film set would tell her break a leg as she turned up for auditions, and adds: The drive in today was very dferent.

A British pilot dramatically ejected from the F-B Lightning on a routine exercise that is believed to have smashed up on impact in the sea but pieces of the destroyed aircraft would still contain highly sensitive features. The pilot was part of the UK’s HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier strike force, which was practising for war. Technology on the aircraft includes top secret radar and sensors that allows the F-B to fly at supersonic speeds without being seen. It is unknown whether an F-B has crashed before in international waters but at the same time it is probable that China is aware of the secret technology through spying.  It is the RAFaposs most advanced plane capable of landing vertically and is the first that the UK has lost. British Armed Forces were last night scrambling to recover pieces of the destroyed warplane in case it falls into enemy hands, such as the Russian navy.The wreckage of the plane was found on Wednesday afternoon and is being protected by an Anglo-US e team until the aircraft is able to be removed by the Navy, reported the Daily Mail. It is believed the pilot is recovering and back on the ship following the crash which happened at am on Wednesday. He was rescued after an emergency operation was launched. An MoD spokesperson said: “A British F pilot from HMS Queen Elizabeth ejected during routine flying operations in the Mediterranean this morning.  “The pilot has been safely ed to the ship and an investigation has begun, so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.” The Mirror understands no other vessels were involved in the incident and the MoD has ordered a probe into what went wrong. There are approximately  F-B jets on the Queen Elizabeth, a £. billion aircraft carrier which is the UK’s biggest-ever warship. The carrier’s F-Bs are equally ided on the ship between the UK’s Royal Air Force and the US Marine Corps. The Queen Elizabeth has a sister carrier called HMS Prince of Wales which is undergoing sea trials.  Sources told the Daily Mirror he was rescued by “assets launching from HMS Queen Elizabeth” which means he was likely plucked from the sea by a Merlin helicopter. It is believed he has had a medical checkup but is not in the ship’s hospital. The Mirror understands the plane was destroyed after it piled at speed into the water shortly after the flyer ejected. At the time of the crash HMS Queen Elizabeth was in the Eastern Mediterranean, on the way back to the UK from the China Sea. It is not known how far the plane was from its mother ship when it ran into trouble. This is the first major mission for the carrier, which is accompanied by a number of other Royal Navy warships. There were eight UK F-Bs on board HMS Elizabeth before the crash and ten US Marine Corps F-Bs. Sources said it was “early days” in the investigation and the devastating smash remains a mystery. One told the Mirror: “It could have been a seagull strike, at the moment we don’t know. “But the most important thing is that the pilot has survived. “It is not yet knownthere was a fault in the plane.” Another source told the Mirror other FB flights in the UK from RAF Marham are not being suspended.

Army Girls, by historian Dr Tessa Dunlop, is an extraordinary insight into the women who served in the Second World War. Dr Dunlop said: “The recruitment net deliberately targeted young females, an age group identied as commitment-free, hardworking, healthy and obedient. “These girls were expected to serve day and night, in all weathers, away from home and sometimes under enemy fire and overseas. “The vast majority did what they were told and didn’t complain.” Here we speak to three of them: Barbara, , was  when she signed up in  and trained to be a driver in Camberley, Surrey, with the Auxiliary Territorial Service.  Now a great-great-grandmother, she recalls: “I was working at that time as a telephone operator in a small factory making aircraft parts after school. “I knew that as soon as I turned  that would become a reserved occupation and I’d have been sent to the factory floor. That didn’t sound very exciting at  so, unbeknown to my manager, on my day off I went to the recruitment office. “When I told my manager I’d been inducted he said, ‘I’ll put a stop to this’ and I thought, ‘What have I done ’ But the recruitment officer rang him up and said, ‘There’s nothing you can do about it, she’s already in the Army’. “And that was that. In the end he shook my hand and wished me all the best.” After a month of basic training Barbara, who was born in Morley, West Yorks, opted for a -week stint at an all-female unit driving school. She says: “It was a very hard, intensive course. We started off on three-ton lorries, then down to K ambulances – the big green ambulances with red crosses on the side. By the time we finished the course we were able to maintain the vehicles and kept them in top-class condition.” Barbara, who now lives in Selby, North Yorks, then spent two-and-a-half years in Anti-Aircraft Command.  She later became a driving instructor at a training centre in Wales. She wed RAF man Stanley Weatherill in . She says: “We both came out of the services on the same day. I never got a proposal. He wrote to my father asking for my hand in marriage and wrote to tell me my father was delighted. I thought he could have asked me, but it was quite funny. We laughed about it many times.” Betty was just  when she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service two years into the war, in .  She recalls: “There were lots of us in a domestic science college near Shrewsbury at the time and we decided we ought to be doing more for the war effort. “So we left and joined ious forces. I went into the ATS and the others went into the Wrens and dferent places. We felt it was better that we should be doing something important.” Looking back on her period of training, Betty says she did everything from learning how to march and wear her unorm correctly to going through gas mask drills and learning how to “properly address our elders and betters”.  When her training ended, Betty, who had grown up speaking German despite living in rural Shropshire, was sent to London for an interview with an Intelligence Corps officer. “He told me, ‘Get yourself to Bletchley Park’,” she recalls. “I’d never heard of it. On arrival we were told we’d be billeted in houses round about, and the following morning we were bussed in and given the Official Secrets Act to read. We were told to read it and swear not to ulge anything until . “Of course it was quite a shock, but I had no choice but to abide by the rules. It was so strict I couldn’t even tell my parents where I was, and they died before I was at liberty to tell them.” Betty, whose husband Alfred died in the s, remained at Bletchley Park until the end of the war in Europe. She says: “I was posted to America then. “I was sent there because I’d been paraphrasing decoded Japanese signals, and this was work that carried on at the Pentagon.  “I worked there from June until September , and the place was absolutely enormous. I believe there were around , people who worked there, mostly American, and it was all very secretive. “I was only allowed into the office where I worked.” Once the war ended, Betty made her way back to Blighty. “We just had to pack up, tidy up, and that was the end of it,” she says. “It took me a very long time before I got home. I came back on what had been a troop ship during the war. It took four or five days to get from New York to Southampton and it was very rough and unpleasant.” In  Betty was able to reunite with mother Charlotte and father Lesley Vine-Stephens, who had served in India during the First World War. Betty later became a permanent staff officer for the Cheshire Battalion of the Territorial Army and was the Birmingham recruiting officer from –. She went on to work with the Birmingham Law Society and served on her local parish council in Wythall, Worcs, for  years. She says revisiting her memories for the book has been a “marvellous” experience. Daphne signed up for the th Searchlight Regiment Royal Artillery. “I joined up at  because I lived in a village in Norfolk, and I wanted to get out,” says Daphne, who now lives in Chelmsford, Essex. “I wanted to go at  and a half, but mother wouldn’t let me, so I went at .” After three weeks of training in Northampton, Daphne was selected to go to the teleplotter station with the Royal Artillery as a teleprinter operator for the st Army Group. “I did a course in Melton Mowbray before I was posted to Essex Regiment, and I stayed right until D-Day,” she recalls. “I ended up at Hull where we had lots of terrible raids, but I loved the job. It was wonderful seeing the searchlights as they went up to engage the enemy.” Daphne lost her school friend on a gun site six months after she joined up. “I remember Dorothy lying there with just the smallest scar on her forehead where the shrapnel had entered,” she recalls. “It didn’t put me off service, it made me more determined.” And while Daphne had been engaged before joining the service, she did not marry until she was in her s. “I had been engaged to a man in the air force at  and a half,” she says. “We thought we were more mature in those days. But I didn’t marry him. I met my husband Sidney Thomas through the job I later had with the GPO in Ipswich where I worked in the telegraph office. “I met him in Chelmsford, and made my home here.

Those wishing to make a claim should apply through JobCentre   . Applications made because of a change in circumstance should be done over the phone. Applicants will need to explain their reasons for needing the loan - and wonapost get the payment automatically. They will also need to be able to prove that they can pay back the cash, and agree a rate at which the loan will be repaid.

Whether it’s the medley of teenage lads shouting “Here comes Fatty” to me as they scoff a p cheeseburger, or the experience of witnessing a grown man rip off a Covid- protection window due to a lack of milkshakes, my six years at McDonalds have been nothing short of a flurry. After applying fresh out of high school , McDonald’s flexible hours and healthy rate of pay was extremely attractive to a skint first-year college student. And while most worry the lack of experience would be the issue with younger staff members, it’s the drama you’ve got to watch out for.  Once you’re past the three-month probation - during which most existing staff members refuse to acknowledge your existence - every fresh cohort brings a brand-new tier to Macciesapos ever growing political chain. However, the real initiation isn’t complete without the obligatory mid-sht breakdown. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve caught crying in the freezer, the stock room, even behind the bins. It’s a rite of passage for new staff members. Keeping a brave face is at least  percent of the job. From the Friday stampede of orders , to shovelling the remnants of half-chewed chicken nuggets from abandoned trays into the bin, and even having abuse hurledfor receiving cold food “after waiting for half an hour” always half an hour.It’s all just a part of the job.  That’s not to say every customer is rude, though. But there are the ones who test patience in a busy Drive-Thru. Firstly, nothing is LESS funny than when people try and order a Wicked Zinger Box Meal. Secondly, on behalf of every McDonald’s worker, we don’t serve mayonnaise. I don’t know why we don’t serve mayonnaise I don’t know IF we will ever serve mayonnaise and “speaking to the manager” about the lack of mayonnaise certainly isn’t going to solve anything. Thirdly, we can hear and see everything you do while you’re waiting to give your order by the Drive-Thru speakers. I can’t tell you how many solo renditions of cringe ‘s pop hits I’ve heard over the years. Alas, the serenade of freshly driving teens and those who queue for half an hour for the sake of a bottle of waterblocks out the eight hours of incessant beeping machines. *The writeraposs name has been changed.

His landlord sued him, alleging he damaged the propertyThe flat in Hudson Street, New York City, was transformed into a night club, court papers sayByChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov A landlord is suing his former tenant for over £, after he allegedly turned his flat into a night club during the pandemic, hosting rowdy house parties. Kurt David, , lived in the two-storey property in Tribeca, New York City, but moved out in June, according to reports. His landlord, identied as Eisdorfer  LLC in a lawsuit, alleged the tenant held parties at the house, inviting hundreds of people who had to pay for entry. The property, which cost ,a month, was turned into a night club where party-goers drank alcohol and smoke marijuana, court papers say. The parties, held during the coronavirus pandemic, were in breach of restrictions and the host was arrested twice for them, according to US media. On March , officers broke up a party with more than  people who were not wearing face masks, Gothamist reports.A -year-old, who was apparently drunk, had to be taken to a local hospital after falling from the stairs, Sherf Joseph Fucito said. The teenager later told investigators he had bought alcohol at the party. David was arrested and charged with selling alcohol to minors, unlawfully dealing with children, and violating emergency orders. He was fined ,for failure to protect health and safety, according to reports.  The previous month, the tenant had been charged with misdemeanours after officers broke up another party. Court documents say: The scene Defendants have created appears to be that of a nightclub, causing the severe disturbance to last into the early hours of the morning. These parties attract such a high-volume crowd that the Defendants have hired security guards bouncers to operate the door when letting guests into the Premises. Now, the landlord is suing David and his mother Jean Elbaum-David, who also signed the lease, for four months of unpaid rent, late fees, violations charges from the Department of Buildings and Sanitation, legal fees and for the cost of fixing the house.  The lawsuit alleges the company had to pay ,to fix the property, including replacing broken appliances, window shades, balcony and roof pavers, faucets, the sound system, the security and camera system, the intercom, window panes, drywall, hardwood floors and a bathroom vanity unit, the New York Post reports.The company also said they had to paint the property, fix the electrical system and employ heavy-duty cleaners to make the flat livable again. David told the New York Post he was a legal resident of the building and that he had paid rent. He said: Rent has been paid on time over the duration of the full-year lease and due to Covid-, I filed the Covid- hardship declaration and the landlord holds ,for two months security and one-week free rent.

Most of the people that know me, and him, realise how in love we are, and how this is great exposure for his career so they have been more than supportive throughout this process, said Rika. Those that donapost know him, well letaposs just say theyaposve been less than supportive. Since her man isnapost allowed to have his phone while theyaposre filming and nothing has been aired, she has no idea of knowing what heaposs going to be getting up to. The show hasnapost aired yet. He doesnapost have his phone throughout filming so I have no idea whataposs going on. I donapost think Iaposm allowed to know whataposs going on.

The parents travelled to Ukraine in August  after their baby was born to a surrogate mother. But for reasons unknown, the pair ed to their home country of Italy shortly after and left the new born behind, in the care of her nanny. While they promised tothey never came back to get her and so the little girl, now  months old, was cared for by the nanny who raised her as her own daughter. Realising the parents might notand worried about the legal repercussions, the nanny contacted the Italian consulate to report that she could no longer afford to raise the child. Italian authorities at the Juvenile Prosecutor’s Office were able to track down the parents and confirm that the couple did not intend to take their daughter back. Now, a court has determined that the little girl should be put up for adoption, leaving the nanny devastated that she will have to give her up. Ukraine is among a handful of countries in which surrogacy is commercial and legal and the country offers a systematic and large-scale provision of surrogate services to the world. A shocking video last year showed almost  surrogate babies crammed in a dormitory at a hotel in Kiev as the lockdown stopped their parents from collecting them.The parents from the UK, USA, Italy, Spain, France, Israel, Germany, China, Mexico, Romania and other countries had paid between £, and £, for services from an organisation that assisted them with starting families. But due to the pandemic causing countries to close their borders, the baby were being cared for by staff at a so-called aposbaby factoryapos. Last week, the Service for International Police Cooperationcoordinated with the Italian Consulate in the Ukrainian capital to organise for the baby to be taken to Italy and put up for adoption. A team that consisted of officials from the Italian Red Cross, including a paediatrician and volunteer nurse, travelled to Ukraine to fly the girl to Italy. The child was flown to Malpensa, on November  where she is currently being cared for by a foster family while the adoption process is underway. Carolina Casini, a volunteer pediatrician of the Italian Red Cross, told the court that the baby had slept for the entire duration of the trip in her arms. Although the team had been afraid of finding her in poor condition and emotionally deprived, they found that the little girl was in good condition and that the nanny who looked after her until yesterday loved her very much and took great care of her.”  The nanny was reported to have been heartbroken by the news and handed over pictures for the girl’s new parents so she will see them when she is grown up. The last recommendation from the nanny to the inspector who took the child back to Italy was: “Sheaposll eat the banana, give her a whole one.” It is unclear whether the surrogate parents will face prosecution for allegedly abandoning their baby daughter in Ukraine.

Badesim Kubak, who is from Turkey but now lives New York, said she wanted her legs waxed for a concert, as her culture frowns on shaving. But what should have been an easy appointment caused her to need three weeks of medical treatments for the burns left by the wax. In a TikTok she wrote: Starting with waxing my legs, itaposs painful but I can take it. While the lady is applying the wax to my inner thighs, the lid of the applicator comes off and boiling wax spills all over between my legs. She added the wax spilled just inches from her vagina, and she started screaming and crying from the excruciating pain. But instead of stopping the treatment to seeshe was ok, or check what she had done, Badesim claims the beautician told her she was making a big deal out of it, and told her everything was ok. She rips the wax off me to stop it from burning my skin, while telling me it is seriously nothing, Badesim continued. aposShe puts MOISTURISER and PAPER TOWELS on my burn and tells me she is done. I am super embarrassed that everyone  in the salon heard me scream and cry.apos Without knowing what  to do, Badesim paid full price for her botched wax and went back to school, where a nurse tried to help as best they could. But the following morning it became clear the situation was more serious than initially thought, and was far more serious than the beautician said it would be. Next morning I wake up with insane pain, my leg is still wrapped up, she continued. My parents take me to my uncle who is a plastic surgeon to check it out.  Once the bandages came off the full extent of the injury became clear. She shared a picture of the injuries she received, showing the horrendous burn down her thigh. The video has since had over . million views, and Badesim filmed a part two video to answer questions about the incident asked by her horried followers. In it she said: My family and I were very shocked to see what was underneath the bandages, we were not expecting that at all. My uncle was surprised that I didnapost pass out from pain but I guess that was because she kept telling me I was making a big deal out of it, so I kind of just sucked it up. The following two-three weeks I had to go to my uncleaposs clinic every single day becausea burn like that gets infected it could end up horrible. I couldnapost walk properly for a while either because just putting pressure on that leg hurt. In another follow up video Badesim said her leg had healed nicely, and you could only see what had happenedyou looked very closely. She also explained why she decided not to sue the beautician - but added she regrets not taking action at the time. Badesim also revealed the salon she went to closed only two months after her incident, although she did not find out why. My family asked meI wanted to sue and they said they would respect my decision and me being , I feel like I was very naïve, she explained. I knew that the lady who was waxing me had a young daughter and I didnapost want her to suffer because of her mumaposs mistakes. But now looking back at it, thataposs not how it works and I should have sued. Not even because of the fact that she burned me but because of the fact that she made a -year-old girl feel like she was making a big deal and that she was guilty for being in pain.

spotted throughout the month, however it will likely be strongest and therefore most visibleearly in the morning on November .To spot the Leonid meteor shower, certain conditions are required, including a clear nightsky.Unfortunately, weather conditions in Scotland for early Thursday morning look set to be cloudy with rain, which does not provide ideal conditions for seeing shooting stars.Those in the south are in for a better chance atseeing the display, with more intermittent cloudand dry weather forecast.However, we cant rule out seeing the meteor shower in Scotland for goodeven though Thursday morning will mark the point with the most shooting stars, the Leonid shower could continue in the following days, just with fewer meteors.Its best therefore to keep your eyes peeled over the coming days to be in with a chance of spotting some shooting stars.Generally, the shooting stars are easier to see in rural places away from street lights and light pollution.Its also

current measures.The past two days have seen a flurry of Covid related announcements Boris Johnson gave a press briefing yesterday in which he refused to rule out the reintroduction of restrictions in England, and the vaccine booster scheme was extended to include --year-olds.Nowin the aftermath of COP, which experts warned could lead to a spike in cases, the Scottish government is

deciding not to implement any changes at the moment.However, the first minister did confirm they were considering making changes to the current rules on vaccine passports, with a decision due to come

confirmed that these changes were still under consideration.If such measures are introduced, it would meanpeople wouldrequire vaccine passports to visit venues such as indoor theatres,cinemas and some licensed hospitality venues, as well as nightclubs and large scale events.Any changes would be introduced from December , according to the first minister.Despite experts warning before the climate conference that we could see Covid figures surge, this does not currently appear to be the case according to the first minister.She said that although we couldnt draw \"finalconclsuions\" as of yet, \"there is no sign so far of any signicant spike in cases associated with COP.\"The first minister also used the example of COP as a reason to use lateral flow tests, which she advised people took twice a week as well asremindingthe public that these tests can be ordered online for free.Yesterday it was confirmed that people aged - in Scotland would be offered a Covid booster jab, after results found that a third dose signicantly improved protection.On Monday, the online portal opened for over-s in Scotland to book their booster jabs, with the first minister confirming over-s would be

The BBC \"national news\" is dominated by domestic reports on health, education and transport which only apply south of the Border. These bulletins are followed by the \"UK Weather\" which iniably concentrates on the populous south and generally refers to Scotland en passant as ldquothe far north or, where I live, ldquothe extreme north. No wonder all fair-minded Scots are exasperated.The BBC Scotland channel has been a small but welcome development, but it is run on a shoestring and ultimate editorial control still resides where. Scotland is poorly served by the BBC and ITV, who understandably will always look to serve their majority English audience.There is an obvious need to wrest control of broadcasting to Scotland, but I suspect that will not happen until Scotland decides to take full responsibility for its governance in a second referendum.Until then, ing to Ms Laxrsquos theme, we could be getting agitated about topics such as Tory sleaze, Westminster corruption and the failure of our MPto remember his two other jobs and timeously declare his earnings.Iain Gunn, Elgin.UNREST IN THE BORDERSA HEALTHY ing democracy depends on voters having access to information and news from more than one source. Television is one,not the major, provider of such information and especially of news.Sadly, those of us who live in the south of Scotland are very limited in the TV news we can access about our own country, having only a choice between Border TVand BBC Scotland .I have little interest in news from Carlisle or Cumbria in general, yet my so-called ldquolocal news is dominated by items from these areas. I am much more interested in what happens in the rest of Scotland ndash where I was born, where I live and where most of my family and friends reside.I know some lucky people can view STVvia the internet or satellite, but surely it is time this channel ndash again, Scottish TV ndash was available on terrestrial signals for the whole of Scotland.Fiona Lessels, Beattock.PARLIAMENT IS A FULL-TIME JOBADAM Tomkins speaks for himself when he states in his column that being an MP or MSP is a part-time job . Having been elected to serve in the Scottish Parliament for one term, courtesy of the Tory Party list, Professor Tomkins managed to find the time to do another job and collect another salary in academia. He obviously did not consider himself to be first and foremost a representative of the people and I wonder how he would have faredhe had stood for election in a constituency instead of depending on a party ticket.I think I can speak with more parliamentary experience than Prof Tomkins. When I announced my retirement in , I was the longest-serving parliamentarian in the Scottish Parliament, having served at Westminster for more than a quarter of a century, followed by eight years at Holyrood. At the first election to the Scottish Parliament, I was the only Independent member to be elected. I had the biggest majority of any constituency in Scotland on both occasions when I stood for the Scottish Parliament.I do not think that my constituents would have ed me time after timeI had been a part-timer. It is a great privilege to serve as a parliamentarian and the fact that some MPs and MSPs, mainly from Prof Tomkins party, have abused their position should not detract from the fact that the majority of MPS and MSPs are full-time public servants who work hard for the people they represent.Dennis Canavan, Bannockburn.SHAME ON SCOTS TORY MPsIT came as no surprise when I learned that five of the six Scottish Conservative MPs voted in the House of Commons on Monday night to break their manesto commitment to retain the triple lock on state pensions [David Mundell did not vote]. This action will deny pensioners around pound per annum, an amount that could pay idends to their wellbeing during winter by allowing the heating to be switched on, by eating the right kind of nourishing food in cold winter days. Yet those MPs here in Scotland prioritised following the party line over pensioners in their constituencies.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.ENERGY PLANS WILL MAKE US POORERNICOLA Sturgeon has carried out the first part of her energy strategy by declaring her opposition to the Cambo oil field . However, what the First Minister has still to outline is her future strategy on obtaining the fossil fuel needed to power the gas turbine plant at Peterhead which will replace Hunterston B or to supply the gas gridthe policy issued by Patrick Harvie to rip out every boiler has not been dropped into the bin, as neither the public purse nor the taxpayer can afford the pound billion debt .The plan now being adopted by the First Minister involves a % hydrogen mix into the grid, meaning a requirement for % of domestic gas still remains ndash hence the need for the Cambo output to keep the lights on in Scotland when the wind does not blow and to keep central heating systems operational over the winter.The problem for Alasdair Galloway in his claim that \"fighting climate change does not have to make us poorer\"is that it is incorrect. It is an expensive technology that is required to split hydrogen from water and then transport the gas to the point of use or provide stand-by plant when wind turbines sit idle in rural Scotland. All those costs have to be met by the energy consumer, thus escalating bills to more than pound, a year. Going green means a poorer standard of living for the majority of Scots.Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.* REGARDING the cost of greener heating:a scheme were introduced whereby the cost of carbon-neutralising onersquos home would be recovered with an inheritance tax credit, those who could afford it could be incentivised to spend the money at no immediate cost to the Government.Alexander Caldwell, East Kilbride.* AN increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide has an important effect on the Earths climate but it is a wilful abuse of the language to describe it as pollution. The main constituents of the atmosphere are nitrogen, oxygen, argon, water vapour and carbon dioxide and the increase of any of them would not be pollution, regardless of any possible consequences.PM Dryburgh, Edinburgh.DO HOUSEHOLDS NEED TWO CARS I AM recovering from the \"shock and horror\" forecast by Willie Macleanin his defence of a Tory government. However, at the risk of causing yet more shock and horror, I must express my gratitude to Westminster governments for building miles of motorways all across England while doing Scotland the favour of keeping us virtually motorway-free for years we now know that was all for the best, as motorways only encouraged people to drive on them.My bus pass gets me around Scotland, and I am pleased that from the end of January the Scottish Government is introducing free bus travel for residents in Scotland aged under .

She said that the scheme may also begin to accept proof of a recent negative COVID- test as an alternative to the vaccine passport.Ms Sturgeon, who said that while she hoped to keep businesses across Scotland open throughout the winter, the Government has not completely ruled introducing harsher restrictions should the COVID- situation worsen. She has urged all business owners and employers to think carefully and #look again# at whether their employees can be supported to work from home, this winter.#While we hope we will get through winter without introducing further restrictions, we do have a duty to keep proportionate options under review,# she said.#We are publishing an updated strategic framework today, covering some of the issues have already summarised.#Finally, the First Minister urged the nation to stick as closely to the current guidance as possible in order to prevent the spread of COVID-.

Our staff are socially distanced and the office sanitised on a regular basis.

Efforts have been ongoing over a number of months now to update IT systems within Orkney Ferries, to allow for more dynamic and flexible working practices in the future # including an online booking system # but this has been hampered by global IT shortages and supplier issues beyond the ability of the team to control or influence.#A service was restored at the first opportunity, albeit on a limited scale # and we are back to normal from today .#Whilst we appreciate the situation is far from ideal, we would ask for recognition that for the duration of this pandemic, our staff and crews have put considerable time and effort into supporting all our island communities # reacting at often short notice to regulatory changes to ensure the continuation of this important service.  We appreciate the frustration felt by our customers over the weekend but the abuse that has been received across social media and on the telephone is unacceptable and unfair.##That cannot continue. If the current contractors are unable to deliver what is needed, Orkney Ferries needs to replace them with someone who can. Given the leline nature of these services, the public and staff deserve a booking system fit for the job.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It goes to the heart of politics.Writing in the Yorkshire Post, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Governmentrsquos planned investments would still mean ldquofaster journeys, to more places, more quickly for Yorkshire, while confirming a new study to plan how best to eventually link Leeds to the HS network.The Post reported the IRP was expected to confirm the HS route to Leeds would be axed in favour of a Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway line.High-speed trains would travel on slower track to Sheffield, meaning HS trains would reach Yorkshire but the high-speed line itself would not, the paper said.In his column, Mr Johnson wrote: ldquoHS will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour  minutes ndash precisely the same as under the old HS plans.ldquoWersquoll look at how to get HS to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen.ldquoBut high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the s. Levelling up canrsquot wait that long. And towns like Wakefield, Doncaster, Dewsbury and Huddersfield would have suffered as trains were taken off the existing main lines.The DfT insisted it will ldquotransform journeys to and between the East and West Midlands, Yorkshire and the North West, with benefits delivered ldquoup to  years sooner.It said in a statement that ldquothe full HS and Northern Powerhouse Rail schemes as originally proposed would not enter service until the early to mid-s.One of the aims of the IRP was to increase capacity and have more frequent services ldquoin a way that presented value for money for the taxpayer, according to the department.ldquoFrom London and across the Pennines, the IRP delivers journey times which are the same as, similar to or faster than the original HS and Leeds-Manchester proposals, while doubling or trebling capacity and ensuring passengers and consumers benefit from tangible changes more quickly.The Government-commissioned Oakervee Review warned in  that the final bill for the entire Y-shaped network of HS could reach pound billion.Phase  will run between London and Birmingham, and Phase a between Birmingham and Crewe.Phase b was due to extend the line between Crewe and Manchester, and between Birmingham and Leeds, although the later stretch is expected to be curtailed.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days."},{"url":null,"title":"covid passports one piece in a jigsaw of required measures says swann as stormont ministers back plan","story":"DUP MP Sammy Wilson defended people’s right to choose to get or not get vaccinated after party decided not to block move at Executive meeting\"srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w\" sizes\"auto\"  ExpandExpandPreviousNext\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland fc .ece AUTOCROP w Covid%Passport w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Stock Image: The COVIDCert NI app that displays vaccination passports for domestic and travel use on November,   Kevin Scott   Belfast The Assembly met on Wednesday to debate Covid passports FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueStock Image: The COVIDCert NI app that displays vaccination passports for domestic and travel use on November,   Gillian HallidayTwitterEmailNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMandatory vaccine passports are set to be introduced in Northern Ireland next month after Stormont ministers voted by a majority to support the move – which has been branded “stupid policy” by DUP MP Sammy Wilson.DUP ministers opposed Health Minister Robin Swann#s proposal at the Executive meeting on Wednesday.However, the party did not deploy a cross-community voting mechanism to block the introduction of vaccine certication in the region. It was passed by six votes to four.Read MoreCovid certication NI: all you need to know about the contentious policyRead MoreFive simple steps to bring NI Covid cases down without locking downEmpty stadiums, hospitality restrictions, financial incentives: How the rest of Europe is grappling with Covid surgesCoronavirus NI:  deaths, , cases, % hospital capacity as Executive considers passport planBBC Radio Ulster’s Evening Extra has reported that a two-week ‘grace period’ will be introduced in the run-up to the new measure being introduced on December .It is thought venues could face fixed penalty finesthey do not comply. Previously, the Executive had encouraged hospitality to deploy it on a voluntary basis.It is expected Covid status certication, further details of what that entails is to be released by the Executive, will be needed to access pubs, nightclubs, restaurants, cinemas, indoor music events and outdoor concert events.Read MoreNurse reveals ‘war zone medicine’ in NI hospitals as system ‘crumbles’Empty stadiums, hospitality restrictions, financial incentives: How the rest of Europe is grappling with Covid surgesThe Department of Health is set to produce a further paper, and it has introduced an online service for NI residents who have received one or both doses of their Covid- vaccinations to apply for Covid vaccination certication.Health Minister Robin Swann said our health service is “under severe stress” and action was necessary.“Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures,” he said.Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles.”“The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated.

And the virus is only transmitted by infected people.“Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act.”The existing CovidCert NI app, developed to support international travel, has now also been updated to allow the public to display a domestic use certicate as well as the existing certicate for travel.DUP MP Sammy Wilson, who has branded the use of Covid passports an “unacceptable step” into people’s personal lives, said he remained opposed to its introduction.This is something which should not have been put through in haste the way it has done,” he told Evening Extra.Pointing out his party had voted against the move, the short timescale involved in pushing through the measure, was “not the way of making policy”.“It’s not the way of making policy, simply to cover up for the inability of the Minister [Robin Swann] who has had a year and a half to get hospitals geared up to dealing with Covid,” he explained.And yet we find that the same reasons are being used for yet measures today as were argued a year and a half ago: to save the NHS.How many times are the public, and hospitality sector – or other parts of the economy – have to have penalties imposed on them to save the Minister from the consequences of his own lack of planning.”Askedhe would show a Covid passport himself, Mr Wilson stressed he did not believe anyone should have to disclose their medical status to anyone.I could be excluded, or other iniduals could be excluded, from a cafe where there’s only two customers sitting and I could go home on a packed bus and I would be required to show a Covid passport in a half-empty cafe. But not required to show a Covid passport on a packed bus. That’s how stupid this policy is.”Pressed againhe would get a passport, Mr Wilson said people in society should be free to make decisions for themselves in relation to getting the vaccine.Askedhe was disappointed that his party did not deploy the blocking mechanism to prevent passports being passed, the MP said he was not yet aware why the veto was not used.It may well be that our Ministers did not decide to use the veto until they have additional information,” he explained.It’s a question you would have to ask our Ministers.”He added: “I think this a bad policy for many sectors which are already floundering… It’s also a policy that will give a  sense of security to many iniduals.Because don’t forget that having a covid passport, or having a vaccination, does not stop people getting infected… or stop them passing on the infection.”Public health experts have said those who are vaccinated are less likely to transmit the virus and will have less severe symptomsthey contract Covid.TUV leader Jim Allister branded the move “wrongheaded both in focus and effect”, insisting the policy must be brought to the Assembly for an early vote.“The common practice of voting on these proposals weeks after implementation won’t do,” he said.“Until now any restrictions have applied equally to all. Now, this move picks out a section of society for the special treatment of exclusion on a mandatory basis. This is wrong.Encouragement of hospitality businesses and events organisers to seek proof of vaccine or a negative test is one thing, and to me acceptable, but to make such mandatory is a step too far.”He added: “The clear purpose of the mandatory Vaccine Passport is to compel people to get vaccinated, yet, the Executive would not dare make vaccination mandatory but seeks the same outcome by the stealth of mandatory passports.”Meanwhile, Adrian McNally, general manager of Titanic Hotel, said he was in favour of the policy, insisting it gives assurance to people coming into venues.For  days so far across the lockdowns, hospitality has been closed in the hotel sector.. I don’t want a -day closure so anything the Department of Health is going to do that I can continue to trade and accept guests, I am going to go along with that,” he told Evening Extra.That’s the reasonable thing to do.”SDLP MLA Nichola Mallon MLA  said the decision should have been taken when the party first proposed it two months ago to relieve pressure on health services.“Instead, emergency health services have been brought to brink. In the middle of this crisis political leaders cannot afford to put popularity ahead of public health,” she said.“It is critical now that implementation of the certication programme and the winter contingency plan is accelerated. Securing certication has been an uphill struggle but it will not be enough on its own to protect the health service and prevent people from getting sick.“The last thing people want is another Christmas apart from each other. The SDLP is warning that we need to act now to use every tool in our toolbox to protect our health service, keep our businesses safely open and prevent any further lockdown.”Read MoreCancel Christmas work party and Santa visit to keep Covid cases down, says public health expertRelated topicsNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Northern Ireland AssemblyNearly , children on waiting list seeking mental health helpCovid certication NI: all you need to know about the contentious policy PremiumEmpty stadiums, hospitality restrictions, financial incentives: How the rest of Europe is grappling with Covid surgesCovid passports NI: DUP’s Sammy Wilson blasts plan as ‘unacceptable step towards unwarranted state control of people’s lives’North Coast families priced out by second homersMost ReadFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorPictured: Man in court charged with threatening to kill Health Minister Robin Swann identied through Twitter handle used, court toldCovid passports ‘one piece in a jigsaw of required measures’, says Swann as Stormont ministers back planWatchdog to assess claim Minister has a ‘conflict of interest’Top VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest CoronavirusLisa SmythOpinionOur health service was crumbling long before it was struck by CovidBoy hospitalised after assault at teen disco linked to  Covid casesNI hospitality trade split over Covid vaccine passport decisionCancel Christmas work party and Santa visit to keep Covid cases down, says public health expertVideo: Inside the Elk teen disco linked to  Covid cases and  more self-isolatingLatestPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeCharles and Camilla arrive in EgyptDale Taylor’s a hit but Liam Boyce loss is concerning for Northern Ireland: Glenn FergusonCautious optimism for Christmas but new year rise in Covid cases likely – expertMeghan tells ‘Auntie Ellen’ she and Harry are happy in US and Lili is teething,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of HealthNearly , children on waiting list seeking mental health helpCovid passport certication NI: all you need to know about contentious policy PremiumNI hospitality trade split over Covid vaccine passport decision PremiumTaxpayer billed £k for every Covid case in Northern Ireland’s quarantine hotel PremiumScrapped procedures ‘forcing surgeons into private sector’ in Northern IrelandMost ReadFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorPictured: Man in court charged with threatening to kill Health Minister Robin Swann identied through Twitter handle used, court toldCovid passports ‘one piece in a jigsaw of required measures’, says Swann as Stormont ministers back planWatchdog to assess claim Minister has a ‘conflict of interest’Top VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest CoronavirusLisa SmythOpinionOur health service was crumbling long before it was struck by CovidBoy hospitalised after assault at teen disco linked to  Covid casesCovid passport certication NI: all you need to know about contentious policyCovid passports ‘one piece in a jigsaw of required measures’, says Swann as Stormont ministers back planNI hospitality trade split over Covid vaccine passport decisionLatestChallenge to presidential oath inadmissible, says European Court of Human RightsPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeCharles and Camilla arrive in EgyptDale Taylor’s a hit but Liam Boyce loss is concerning for Northern Ireland: Glenn FergusonCautious optimism for Christmas but new year rise in Covid cases likely – expert,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Peter ByrneNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEven prior to the pandemic, it wasn’t unusual for trusts to struggle to find space for patients in their hospitals.As far back as , the Royal College of Nursingwas warning about the dangers of squeezing hospital beds into areas without oxygen points and call bells, while overstretched staff complained they didn’t have enough time to take toilet breaks or administer medication to their patients.The situation deteriorated to the point where thousands of healthcare staff took industrial action at the end of , but there was barely any time between the end of the strike and the arrival of Covid- for NHS workers to catch their breath.So, it’s little wonder that almost two years of a global pandemic have had such a profound effect on the health service.As of Wednesday, there were  Covid occupied beds across the hospital system here, which is  beds not available for the patients who need treatment for non-Covid conditions, some of whom are acute medical emergencies, while others have been suffering without treatment for years.And while they languish on ever-stretching hospital waiting lists, their conditions worsen and they turn more frequently to their GP to manage their symptoms.However, there aren’t enough family doctors in Northern Ireland to cope with demand, resulting in more people going to AE for help.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the same time, an increasing number of people waiting for a hospital appointment are becoming emergency cases, requiring admission to hospital.Meanwhile, staff are exhausted, an unknown number are living with the effects of long Covid, others are trying to process the trauma of working through the pandemic, while the workforce is depleted further due to the requirements of isolation.Add to that the shortage of resources in the community, which makes it so dficult to discharge patients from hospital, and it has created the perfect storm in which we now find ourselves.It is true that the vaccines have put us in a better position than this time last year — but only to a certain degree.Despite the rush when they first became available, health officials have struggled to reach their target uptake.Public confidence in the vaccinations has been damaged by the messages coming from some politicians, as well as the disappointment that they aren’t the silver bullet many people mistakenly believed they would be.The fact that they reduce the likelihood of catching the virus, experiencing serious illness and even decrease the chance of dying from Covid- doesn’t seem enough to convince the sceptics that they are an efficient tool in getting us through the pandemic.Sadly, some have taken an all or nothing approach — either the vaccine works % of the time or it isn’t worth getting, even more so now they have realised the vaccines don’t protect for le.Then there are others who can’t see the bigger picture and the reality that by being vaccinated, they are reducing the risk to those most vulnerable from the virus.Waning immunity is also likely to be a factor in Northern Ireland’s depressing case rate. That’s why the booster programme is so important — but even that doesn’t appear to be rolling out as quickly as hoped. All of this is set against a backdrop of an Executive that has pressed ahead with lting restrictions despite the most ardent warnings from health professionals over the state of the health service.Over the summer, officials were once again caught off guard by the might of Covid-, as case numbers spiked a number of weeks sooner than expected.At the time, they blamed the less than impressive vaccine uptake for the surge in positive cases.As a result of the premature peak, operations were cancelled as staff were erted from their normal roles to help care for the influx of seriously ill patients.Even as the health service faltered and pupils ed to class, the Executive approved further relaxations — at the same time there was a contact tracing disaster in our schools.By the time politicians gave the green light to the reopening of nightclubs, health workers were well and truly exasperated by the path we were on.It was abundantly clear that it wasn’t the best move to allow hundreds of people, many unvaccinated, to cram together in loud and unventilated venues, without social distancing or face coverings, while also adding alcohol into the mix.Even more incredibly, the relaxation was timed to coincide with the Hallowe’en holiday. The warnings from staff on the frontline became more frantic. Unusually senior officials even joined the chorus, with Seamus O’Reilly from the Northern Trust explaining that emergency departments may have to shut in response to the mounting pressure.Then as last weekend approached, rumours began to swirl that the AEs at Antrim and Craigavon were close to collapse, emergency plans were put into place to bolster staff numbers and free up beds. Antrim Area Hospital struggled through, but the measures weren’t enough to stabilise the situation at Craigavon.An ambulance ert was implemented twice in the space of -hours, putting further pressure on the hospitals that stepped in to assist.Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association gave an ominous warning.“This is only the start of it,” he said, as the crisis appeared to finally shake the Executive into action. Eventhere was an acceptable Covid- death rate, the impact of coronavirus goes much further than those who lose their lives as a result of this wicked respiratory virus.The elderly pensioner waiting eight hours on the floor before an ambulance arrives, the families caring for frail loved ones due to a lack of care in the community, the parents sending themselves into debt to fund their child’s much-needed operation, the nurses, porters and paramedics who consistently work hours past their finish time to give the best possible care to their patients despite the system falling down around them.They’re all casualties of this mess we’re in.It wasn’t dficult to predict, as we failed to meet keep coronavirus under control, vaccination rates stuttered, the temperatures started to drop and winter viruses began to circulate, that even a small number of Covid- cases would be enough to tip the NHS over the edge.Related topicsAntrim Area HospitalCraigavon Area HospitalThe Executive OfficeMore On Antrim Area Hospital PremiumCovid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health service Premium died after catching virus as patients in Northern Trust hospitals PremiumAftermath of funfair ride accident looked like scene of a bomb, says shaken councillor‘Behaviour’ of teenagers and ‘misuse’ of equipment blamed for Carrickfergus ride mal‘It was terrying’: Eyewitnesses share their shock at Carrickfergus ride malMost ReadDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningPictured: Man in court charged with threatening to kill Health Minister Robin Swann identied through Twitter handle used, court toldCovid passports ‘one piece in a jigsaw of required measures’, says Swann as Stormont ministers back planDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandPolitical figures back Stormont minister after vaccine passport Twitter abusePictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeDale Taylor’s a hit but Liam Boyce loss is concerning for Northern Ireland: Glenn FergusonWilliam Creighton eyeing elusive British Junior title after UK National Rally Driver of the Year accoladeStephen Baxter delighted as red-hot Ben Kennedy pens new Crusaders dealLatestPub group Fuller’s in ‘good place’ for Christmas as bookings surgeBfa sees signs of driver shortage easing after rubbish collection delaysRail plans ‘tinkering around edges not transformation of transport in the North’Political figures back Stormont minister after vaccine passport Twitter abuseWatch: Switzerland break into rendition of ‘Sweet Caroline’ after qualying for  World Cup,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive.

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question. Those who said they would not support a career in policing amounted to around a thirdof the party’s voters polled, with a further % undecided.Sinn Fein politicians attended a PSNI recruitment event for the first time in . Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Policing Board member Gerry Kelly attended the event in what was seen as an open show of support for the force.In a recent interview with the Belfast , North Belfast MLA Mr Kelly said: “People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.”However, he added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one. That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI. There were % of Sinn Fein voters who said they either had no opinion or remain undecided.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyUlster Unionist PartyArlene FosterMichelle O#NeillGerry KellyMore On Police Service of Northern Ireland PremiumNorth Antrim womanappears in court accused of firearms and terrorism offences after DNA found on balaclavaCall for social media companies to take action to stamp out abuse from ‘rate your teacher’ Tik Tok videosBoy hospitalised after assault at teen disco linked to  Covid casesManto appear in court on charges linked to police probe into North Antrim UDA criminalityPictured: Man in court charged with threatening to kill Health Minister Robin Swann identied through Twitter handle used, court toldMost ReadFormer SF mayor behind offensive email resigningDonna Traynor BBC departure: The contenders to replace Newsline anchorPictured: Man in court charged with threatening to kill Health Minister Robin Swann identied through Twitter handle used, court toldCovid passports ‘one piece in a jigsaw of required measures’, says Swann as Stormont ministers back planWatchdog to assess claim Minister has a ‘conflict of interest’Top VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest PoliticsNearly , children on waiting list seeking mental health helpSarah CreightonOpinionWhy UUP needs ‘scundered’ unionists toto the foldMother of IRA Birmingham bomb victim Maxine Hambleton asks PM’s we Carrie Johnson to back fight against Troubles amnestyDUP ministers should not be ‘driven by ideology’ on Covid passport proposal, warns Naomi LongCongress group urges greater US opposition to amnesty planLatestPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeCharles and Camilla arrive in EgyptDale Taylor’s a hit but Liam Boyce loss is concerning for Northern Ireland: Glenn FergusonCautious optimism for Christmas but new year rise in Covid cases likely – expertMeghan tells ‘Auntie Ellen’ she and Harry are happy in US and Lili is teething,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This development within the Park-based group prompted Caroline to take action and so she got in touch with the Alzheimers Society straight away. Within weeks, the group had organised a dementia awareness workshop which saw almost  people turn up. Caroline said: “When we saw the turnout at these events we thought to ourselves theres something happening here, we have high numbers of people in the community looking for information on Alzheimer’s. “We were overwhelmed with the interest and numbers attending and this led to two further workshops being organised with one specically for businesses –  businesses attended. “The large attendance at the workshops subsequently led to the formation of a support group and a volunteer led signposting centre facilitated by Marie Gormley.” Having noticed the demand within the rural community for more support, Caroline helped set up a partnership between the Learmount group, Alzheimer’s Society and Claudy Health Centre to register to become a Dementia Friendly Community . The group also managed to secure funding through the Rural Development Programme, Housing Executive and Derry City and Strabane District Council. The funding was used to make dementia-friendly adjustments to the community groups building. This included signage, colour coding, training facilities and utensils that those with dementia could use. After seeing an advert in a paper for the Old Library Trusts Memory Cafe, Caroline set off for Derry to try and find out how she could set up a similar one in Park. This meeting started a conversation with the Old Library Trust who expressed an interest in including the Learmount group in their DEEDSproject. Shortly after the Old Library Trust secured funding through the National Lottery Community Fund for the project, Learmounts Dementia Social Club was born. Held every Monday morning, the social club have members from Feeny, Claudy, Park, Dungiven and Donemana attend. “We see ourselves as a Dementia Hub for the community and these mornings work so well for us – they are just the loveliest mornings and everyone benefits from them,” continued Caroline. “The carers come along as well and they get so much out of it too because they are meeting other carers who are dealing with the same concerns as them. “We have such great volunteers here in Learmount who have so much enthusiasm and dedication turning up weekly to help the group.” In , Learmount Community Development Group were nominated by the Alzheimers Society for their Dementia Friendly Awards, which they ended up winning. The north Derry groups services are also listed in the Alzheimers Societys literature which is distributed as far away as Scotland. “The social mornings happened so naturally and it just goes to show youthere is an identied need, opportunities will arise from it,” said Caroline. Although Covid- halted the social mornings run by the centre, they have since reconvened and members are delighted to be back. Just a few weeks back, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Graham Warke paid a visit to the Dementia Social Club to congratulate them on being awarded runner up in the Well Being Category of the IPB Pride of Place Awards. The group was nominated for the award by the council and were delighted to receive recognition for the work of their dementia volunteers, families, the Learmount Group and their DEEDS partners at the Old Library Trust. “Having this service is great because in rural areas it helps to remove the stigma and families are more willing to come forward and receive the support thats there on their doorstep,” continued Caroline. “We have guest speakers who come along to the social mornings and it’s just great to have that support around the table. “We would like to thank DEEDS, Claudy Health Centre and the Alzheimers Society for bringing their knowledge and support. They have been so supportive of the work that we are trying to do.” Although they are at full numbers for the social mornings at present, Caroline hopes going forward they will be able to get more families on-board. “Dementia sufferers get huge benefits from the social mornings, members look forward to coming here because it is a safe environment and they feel included in the community.” The McGrellis family recently visited the Dementia Social Club to present Patrick Conway, chairperson of the Learmount Group, with a cheque for pound, the proceeds from their Dan McGrellis, Memorial Charity Golf Day held on August . In total the McGrellis family raised pound, which was ided between Learmount Dementia Group and Marie Curie. Patrick Conway thanked the McGrellis family for the overwhelming amount raised at the charity event. Patrick continued that the generous donation would be used specically to retain dementia services in the local area and would have a huge impact on the support we can offer families. “Over the past six months, Learmount dementia services have received numerous donations from families living in the area – Shaun Mulhern and Ciaran Hutton, Annie-Teresa OKane and family and the McGrellis family - which we are so grateful for and it means that we wont lose our servicesfunding is stopped.” Patrick encouraged anyone who has a family member who has entered the early stages of dementia and would like support to get in touch by contacting the Learmount Group on .

Ms McLaughlin said:“My thoughtstodayare with victims and survivors of these horric institutions who are hopefully finally at the beginning of the end of a very long road. While theJoint First Ministersannouncement is welcome, I still have a number of serious concerns about how the recommendations of the Truth Recovery Design Panel will be delivered. “We have repeatedly seen in the past how the Executive Office and Joint First Ministers have struggled with delivery and there can be no delay on an issue of this importance. Nearly five years on from the Hart report, victims of historic institutional abusein childrens homesare still waiting for payments, an apology and a memorial and this cannot be the case for survivors of mother and baby homes. Both of these matters must be expediated as a matter of the utmost importance. “In both cases the institutions responsible for this abuse must be compelled to fit the bill and compensate victims, they have been guilty of the worst abuses imaginable against vulnerable people and cannot expect others to pick up the pieces.  “I am also concerned that the legislation to establish the public inquiry cannot be introduced in this mandate. The survivors of mother and baby homes have waited long enough and shouldn’t have to wait a day longersomething can be done. Our institutions are currently under threat and with parties unwilling to saythey will assume office depending on the election result, I fear mother-and-baby home survivors could become the latest casualties of the dys that rules this place.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

The families are hoping to raise as much money as they can for Foyle Hospice and HURT, an addiction services charity in the city. After the popularity of last year’s lights, which were put up in a bid to cheer everyone up during lockdown, the neighbours decided to go bigger and better this year. People across Derry are heading down to feast their eyes on the amazing winter wonderland display. Laura Meehan, a resident of Racecourse Drive, said she and all the neighbours love the buzz on the street. “There’s always been a couple of houses on the street that have been heavily decorated. Then more and more neighbours asked for theirs to be done. “So, this year, back in January, we all said we would do a big fundraising event this year. There is a donation box in the centre of the street and all the money is counted and split evenly at the end of the night. “You don’t have to pay to see the street, but you can donate in the wee box. We just ask that cars drive slowly because there are kids running around the street. “From five o’clock onwards, the street does not empty but the atmosphere is brilliant. All the neighbours and kids are running around the street. A woman at the top of the street was even making hot chocolates the other night. So many people came down to see the street last year and this year has been really busy already. I think it’s only going to get bigger each year. “This street is the beststreet to live on, everyone is so friendly and looks after each other. It is so lovely and we are so proud.” Residents are askingany companies could please donate selection boxes for when Santa visits throughout December.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

If The Starjets sound familiar to those of a certain age, then they should as they were part of the Norths punk-scene in the late s with the band being contemporaries of Stf Little Fingers and Derrys own The Undertones. The Belfast quartet scored a hit in  with “War Stories” – a song covered by multi-million selling US rock band, Green Day last year which propelled The Starjets back amongst the big time. Their song about Lyra, who was killed in  when covering a riot in the Creggan area of Derry, is the fourth song in a tribute to women who were killed while still young – the other three being about journalist Veronica Guerin, Princess Diana and Palestinian rights activist Rachel Corrie. While singer and guitarist, Paul Bowen, hopes to get the song out to a wider audience, there is one person he hopes the song will reach – Sara Canning who was the late Lyras partner. Paul said: “I wrote this song of May , a month after Lyra was killed.  The Starjets perform a live version of Legendary Girl, a song about journalist Lyra McKee who was killed in Derry two years ago “Its part of a four-song cycle about women who were murdered or died in a tragic accident – two of them being about Irish journalists. “Lyra being one and Veronica Guerin being the other. The other two women were Princess Diana and Rachel Corrie. “The song about Lyra has received a huge amount of radio interest all over the world in places like Australia, Germany, Holland, Calornia and the UK itself. Its sitting high in two of the UKs independent charts. “The song about Lyra is up against some strong competition in the Heritage Chart. “Were up against Rod Stewart, Diana Ross and Billy Idol – we are minnows compared to them. “Were a small band from Belfast – a blip on the horizon – from the old punk era. “There was an exceptional turn of events during lockdown last year when Green Day recorded one of our songs, War Stories, which we had a minor hit with back in .  The Starjets on BBC show, Top Of The Pops, in  performing War Stories which was covered by Green Day last year “A tsunami of goodwill came our way after that. We didnt think anybody knew who we were but theres emails coming in and posts being put up on social media. “The former Radio  DJ, Mike Read – who had championed us back in the day – phoned me up and askedI had any songs as he had started the Heritage Chart for older artists who do not get played on commercial daytime radio as much. “I said I had a song about George Best, called Geordie Best and I sent it to Mike and it reached number one in that chart back in January. “Im grateful for that and Im also very grateful for all the interest the song about Lyra McKee has generated. “One of my main goals was to get the song to Lyras partner, Sara Canning because I think she would appreciate it – I hope she would. “I didnt know Lyra personally but I knew of her. I knew she signed a deal with a Faber  Faber and that she was high-profile. “Apart from the film that has just been shown at the Belfast Film Festival, theres very little footage of her.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, will take part in the parade which will light up the city centre as it passes through. He will be joined by a number of festive characters and Christmas themed mobile installations. “I am really excited to take part in the parade and see our beautul city lit up for the first time,” he said. “The route is extended around the city centre so that everyone will have their opportunity to see Santa and the characters and you can pick your viewing spot along the route rather than gathering in one place.  Santa Claus, along with an unusually long-eared Mayor Graham Warke, promote Derrys Christmas programme “After last year’s virtual programme, it is particularly pleasing to allow people to attend the switch-on in person again and Council’s maintenance and electrical teams have been working hard this week to ensure the city is looking resplendent on Sunday evening.” The full parade route for Sunday is Bishop Street, The Diamond, Ferryquay Street, Newmarket Street, Orchard Street, Foyle Street, Foyle Embankment, City Hotel Roundabout , Strand Road, Waterloo Place and Custom House Street.

More than  years ago, a commitment was made to take action to promote and protect the Irish language in the Good Friday Agreement. This was reaffirmed in the  St Andrews Agreement, Language legislation was also promised in the New Decade New Approach deal in January  but the fact an Irish Language Act has still not been implemented gives grounds, according to Mr Delargy, for the Secretary of State to intervene. He said: “Sinn Feacutein backAn Dream Dearg’s call on the British Secretary of State to live up to his commitments to legislate for an Acht Gaeilge. “The British Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said at the end of October that he would introduce the legislation. “Irish Language legislation is crucial to delivering genuine recognition to the equal rights and status of an ever-growing community of Gaeilgeoiriacute across our island. “Acht Gaeilge is long overdue. There can be no more delays and the British government should get on with implementing its commitments.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Kevin Lynchs Stars in Your Eyes Event  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Adam Harris and his we Emma have organised a charity football match in memory of their baby boyDerry NewsDerry father organises charity football match to raise funds in memory of his baby boy overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

If the proposed Mid Down College gets the green light, then it will close and become part of the new school.Cllr Walker said he understood the constraints Blackwater was operating under and that there was no room to expand at its Old Belfast Road site, suggesting that it should also relocate to Down Highrsquos current site when it becomes available.The Rowallane politician has again insisted that he supports integrated education and was behind the proposal to create Drumlins Integrated Primary School in Ballynahinch and Killyleagh Primary Schoolrsquos decision several years ago to embrace integrated status.He said he was ldquoin no way attempting to turn the proposed Mid Down College proposal into a political football, branding such a suggestion as ldquoludicrous.Cllr Walker also rejected claims from Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown that the DUP narrative in the post-primary school proposal was ldquoshort-sighted and  in parts and that the steering group behind the new Mid Down College had no intention of taking students away from other schools.Accusing the Alliance man of being ldquodisingenuous, Cllr Walker said his party is not anti-integrated education.In addition, he rejected Cllr Brownrsquos assertion that Newry, Mourne and Down Council did not want to meet with the Mid Down steering group to discuss its proposal.ldquoIt was agreed that steering group members, along with representatives from the other post-primary schools in the area who have concern about the new college proposal, would be asked to meet with a working group comprising elected representatives to outline their respective views, he said.Cllr Walker said that whatever happened moving forward, childrenrsquos education must always come first as they are the future of the district.He continued: ldquoThe bottom line for me is thatthe proposed Mid Down College impacts on existing schools, I will continue to point that out. We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do. The question I have for Cllr Brown is, has he done likewise .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_TUV.jpg","title":"‘Traditional Unionist’  McKee joins TUV weeks after his UUP departure  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has its first TUV councillor.Harold McKee mdash who recently quit the UUP over concerns about the leadership of the party under Doug Beattie mdash had intended to become an Independent member of the local authority, but has instead joined the TUV.The veteran Mournes councillor and former South Down MLA, says joining Jim Allisterrsquos party presents him with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people across his electoral area.This week, Cllr McKee has thanked the many people who have wished him well on his departure from the UUP and his political direction into the future.He explained that since announcing his resignation, he received an overwhelming number of positive messages of support on social media and via phone calls.ldquoI would take this opportunity to thank all those who took the time to message and telephone me, not only local people in Newry Mourne and Down, but also across the whole of Northern Ireland, said Cllr McKee.ldquoIt is often the case when a member leaves a political party that they receive offers from other parties to have a chat with members or indeed the leader to discuss potential future membership. Once again, I would thank those from other unionist parties for their words of encouragement in upholding my Christian faith in the political arena and their offers to have a conversation on my political direction.Cllr McKee confirmed that when he left the UUP, he notied the local councilrsquos chief executiveof his intention to become an Independent councillor for the immediate period to allow some time before deciding where his political future lay.He continued: ldquoWhile I had no intention of making a move to any party anytime soon, I was drawn on the basis of many of my messages and phone calls towards Traditional Unionist Voice.ldquoThis led me to read the TUV policies and manestos which, having read, I believe I am very much in agreement. One of the newspaper articles referred to me as a traditional Unionist and to be honest thatrsquos who I am.Cllr McKee said that following discussions with the TUV leader, Jim Allister, during which he set out the importance of his Christian values as a politician, he has taken up the offer of another party much earlier than he had intended.ldquoLike many people across Northern Ireland, I appreciate the strong and principled leadership Jim has offered, particularly in recent days when it has come to the Northern Ireland Protocol which is undermining our position in the UK, he continued.ldquoI feel that the ethos of TUV and the ever-growing number of members joining the party, particularly in the South Down constituency, provides me with an opportunity to represent the best interests of the people of the Mournes.Welcoming Cllr McKee to the party, Mr Allister said he was delighted that he had decided to join the TUV.ldquoHarold is a conviction politician and as such is a good fit with TUV following his principled resignation from the UUP.

to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS Croskery , C Matthews, F Murphy C Croskery, A Garland , P OrsquoHare.Subs: C Rea, R Croskery, B Ogle, T Noade, J Murnin, R Murphy, O OrsquoNeil, D Murphy, D Tumelty, R Quinn, A Leneghan, B Willoughby, R Walsh.Yellow cards: N Travers, B McComiskey, S Croskery.Dundrum: K WalshR McGuigan, D Flaherty, C Miskelly, A Doyle, J Hurley, T McShane N Rogers, D McComiskeyP Curry, A Fegan , C Hogg, E King, M McGrattan , C Venney .Subs: C Coughlan, Oisin McKibbin, Odhran McKibbin, R Carey, D Brennan, G Grant, K Glavin, C Mulholland, S Keenan, D McComb, S Byrne, A Byrne, B OrsquoConnorYellow Cards: Odhran McKibbin.Referee: Conor Curran ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_santa.jpg","title":"Chance to send letters to Santa in Glasswater Wood  ","story":"EAGER children are visiting Glasswater Wood just outside Crossgar to post their Christmas letters to Santa Claus.A new Santa Claus post box in the woods has become a destination for local families enjoying a country walk as their childrenrsquos excitement builds for the big day ndash with a promise that all letters will go to Lapland.Itrsquos the brainchild of local grandfather-of-four Michael McClements, who created the post box to entertain and please local children.Michael, who runs McClements Construction of Crossgar, said he created the post box out of gas cylinders with help from several local businesses.Itrsquos his latest kind and generous gesture following his creation of wooden houses which he has put on ious trees which tell the stories of the Gruffalo, The Three Little Pigs and other popular childrenrsquos stories.Micheal explained: ldquoI began to make the little houses for the entertainment of my grandchildren as something to do during the last lockdown and thought I would put them on the trees at Glasswater Wood.

Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park. There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Agreement on the draft lease came at a recent meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillors High Gallagher and Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said plans to signicantly invest in the park will be a ldquogame changer for the South Down area.He said the cocktail of funding which has been secured to finance the revitalisation project will transform the built and natural heritage of the sprawling forest park andact as a huge pull for visitors to the area.Cllr Gallagher said he was delighted that the lease issue had been resolved and that the project was progressing.ldquoAs a Castlewellan councillor, this project is huge and will bring so much benefit to the wider area, he continued.ldquoThis same lease confirmed that the very popular lsquotouring in the treesrsquo permit for touring caravan owners will remain in Forest Service control until the end of . This was an issue that was raised with me and many local businesses in Castlewellan.Cllr Gallagher said that after , the local authority will assume responsibility for lsquotouring in the treesrsquo and that the local authorityrsquos senior management team recognises the importance of this longstanding tradition continuing.Cllr Devlin said that as a Castlewellan resident and a member of the forest park revitalisation project board, agreeing the draft lease represented a huge step, one she described as ldquohugely signicant.She added: ldquoThis project has been underway for many years and so much work, time and effort has been exerted by council officers, all of the ious agencies, elected members and project board chairperson Sally Montgomery.ldquoTo see all of this work now materialise is superb. I more or less grew up in the forest park as a child and it was so disheartening to see its deterioration over the years so this is one particular project that I am very excited about.Cllr Devlin extended a ldquohuge thanks to everyone who played a signicant part in getting the project to this stage and looks forward to seeing further developments on the ground..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Lions go contactless  ","story":"NEWCASTLE Lions Club have invested in a mobile contactless card payment device for use with their Christmas collections.The card reader was purchased with donations from Lions members and will ensure that % of all donations will go to charity.Club president Liz Murphy hopes themachine will be a success and stresses that the mobile card payment will be set for a pound donation.The card reader card can be used as a contactless or pin number device.

Catherine OrsquoConnor was in fineform and led the EDAC ladies in style.Her aim was top ten and she managed that with ease coming eighth in . for the three miles. She also got the prize for first over  as a further boost to her confidence.Leanne Spick, who has only recently joined the club, is a competent runner and game for anything so, new spikes purchased, she turned up to see what was what.She was second EDAC lady home, th overall in .. It is fair to say she looked right at home and will likely make further improvement now that she knows the drill.Nuala Taylor, coaxed into racing by her husband John, who wanted her to know how much he had suffered at Comber, couldnrsquot see what the fuss was about as she flew round in . .Wayne Giles gets a bit of teasing for being in the ladiesrsquo race due to being over  but he takes it in good part.He has even volunteered to shave his legs to help him blend in for the team photo. He was th overall .Maureen Kelly was full of beans and went off like the clappers but soon realised that she would be better setting her own pace rather than getting sucked into the speed of others.She sensibly slowed and found a more sustainable rhythm completing in . in nd place.Janine Murray has been running well but with a heavy cold and a hamstring niggle, this is one race she is happy to have behind her. She placed st in ..Alison Carroll in contrast said that this was possibly her most enjoyable cross country race ever and she was well pleased with her time of ..Sam Anderson, going from marathon distance to this shorter effort, was afraid of being last but she was far from it and has even signed up for the next event in two weeks time. Her time of . earned her th slot.With the ladies done and dusted, the men swarmed to the start area. There were nine EDAC representatives, a mix of the experienced and the first timers ready for the five laprace.Gordy Graham prefers the feel of tarmac when he is racing, but he aways commits to whatever challenge is set before him. He, like Catherine, was aiming for a top ten and by virtue of targeting runners ahead hemanoeuvred himself into a good position but had to sprintright to the line to hold his tenth place.He recorded . which is speedy for an off road run.Mackenzie Murray is  but with no junior category for this age, he decided to join in the menrsquos senior team and he proved a useful addition.He found the distance long and at one stage was doubting his ability to stay with the pace but he hung in and even passed more runners to finish th overall in a time of ..Martin Willcox loves cross country, as does Dee Murray, and as old hands they know that pacing is key.They went lap after lap, never showing the strain and finishing in . and . respectively, th and nd.Right behind Dee was Jonny Holmes. This week he was notied that he has been selected as reserve for the over  NI team in the North South Masters XC Challenge to be held this weekend in Belfast, so this was a good chance for some last minute practice.He ran strongly finishing rd in . and we wish him well for Saturday. Carl Keenan, after spectating at Comber, thought that he might enjoy trying cross country for a change and he was right.Carl loved the feel of the grass beneath his feet as well as being part of the EDAC team and ran a steady race coming th in ..Eamon Kelly, who said he wouldnrsquot be back after Comber, had a change of heart as did John Taylor.It looked like these two plus Patrick Smith were having a ball judging by the smiles as they passed or perhaps we misinterpreted their grimaces.Spurred on by the shouts of club mates, they battled to the end and all three made the top . Eamon was th , John thand Patrick th in ..With banana bread and chocolate on hand to revive them, the mood at the finish line was buoyant and the whole EDAC contingent went home satisfied with having made good use of the day.The Born  Run team are excited to be back in business after the long layoff during the pandemic.They welcomed back the runners with open arms to the first event of six in the lsquoWinter Run Forest Runrsquo series, namely the Minnowburn K and K. Both distances started at the Mary Peters Track and then headed off into the forest and then along the towpath.There were over  in the K and  in the K. East Down had two runners both doing the K, Sharon Madine and Rachel Madine .Despite her birthday celebrations the night before, Sharon looked fresh as she set off with the lead pack and she was more than able to stick with the pace throughout.While she didnrsquot particularly relish the hill at the start or the climb to the finish, she appreciated the scenery en route.Her efforts placed her third female at the finish and it is worth noting that her time of . was only a few seconds off second place.Rachel equally enjoyed both the route and the race and was pleased to come well up the field in nd place .For Rachel though, this was only part one of her weekend commitments.The annual event organised by Atlas Running on behalf of the Ballynahinch British Legion took place on Sunday morning with a K route along the back roads of the town.Even though she had already raced the day before, Rachel Madine felt that she couldnrsquot let this race go by without taking part as it is right on her doorstep.In fact she could be considered a regular as this is her third time enteringThe  odd runners who turned up were delighted to be greeted with pleasant, bright weather as last year they had to endure torrential rain and high winds.Despite the hilly course, the race was won in a speedy . by Lawrence OrsquoHara of North Belfast. Rachel finished th in a time of .. A good weekendrsquos work for her.It was cross country all the way for the EDAC juniors last weekend but one option was closer to home in Ballyclare while the other necessitated a long drive to Donegal.The home birds were running in the U- race prior to the McConnell Shield cross country in the Six Mile Water Park. It may only have been a mile but it was a tough mile.Matthew Taylor actually ran more than a mile as he arrived late thinking he was in the next race on the program and performed the quickest vest change and number putting on ever seen.He just made it to the back of the pack as the whistle blew. Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Minister hears about learning experiences after lockdown  ","story":"EDUCATION Minister Michelle McIlveen was in Downpatrick last Wednesday.Ms McIlveen visited St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School.Her first port of call was St Patrickrsquos where she toured the school and met Art students and the Saphara Group as they planned their fund-raising initiatives to support the work of the charity in India.After seeing the schoolrsquos memorial garden, the Minister had an informal cup of tea with members of the schoolrsquos leadership team, as well as the head boy, Patrick Gordon, and the head girl, Eva Rowan.She was interested to hear about their experience of learning during the pandemic, their thoughts on assessment, the Shared Education programme with Down High School and their work as part of the Eco Council.She was told about the impact of the current situation on learning and teaching and their plans and hopes for the future.Ms McIlveen also learned about the schoolrsquos plans to work towards achieving the Wellbeing Award for Schools.St Patrickrsquos has undertaken this award to continue to promote wellbeing and good mental health.The award involves the school demonstrating a clear strategy that promotes and protects emotional wellbeing and mental health, in both students and staff.In the last few weeks, the views of students, parents and staff, regarding how the school promotes and supports mental health and wellbeing, havebeen sought via an online questionnaire and the newly appointed lsquoChange Teamrsquo are now drawing up an action plan.The school principal, Mr Joe McCann said the team was ldquolooking forward to putting in place all the measures we possibly can to optimise wellbeing and mental health for the entire Red High family which continues to be a priority as we come out the other side of the pandemic.At Down High Ms McIlveen was greeted by the stirring skirl of the bagpipes by Year  pupil Alex McSpadden, followed by a rendition of The Parting Glass by IsabellaKelly on harp and her sister, Maya, on violin.After meeting informally with the student leadership team over refreshments, the minister discussed a range of issues with the chairwoman of the board of governors, Mrs Avril Heenan, Mrs Maud Perry, principal, Mr Ken Dawson, deputy principal, and Mr Gareth McKillen, vice-principal for pastoral care.Among the items discussed were the recent progress in Down High Schoolrsquos new build.Enabling works, halted during the pandemic, resumed in April  and the project was issued for tender in October.After a tour of the school site, the minister said she appreciated the urgent need for state of the art facilities for the pupils and teachers for a school that is thriving despite sub-standard premises.Ms McIlveen also discussed the ongoing impact that the pandemic was having on qualications and the mental health of young people.Mrs Perry said afterwards: ldquoIt was lovely to meet with the minister today.

Certainly higher prices feed into the sense of wealth that homeowners can have, and so can encourage spending. It also brings cheer to people who bought over-priced homes  or more years ago, and have never seen their initial outlay recovered.It can further be a sign of a healthy economy.But this surge in prices, whatever it is, is not an indicator of the latter. Its exact origins are unclear, and might include the pandemic having caused people to rethink priorities, and to conclude that it is important to invest in a good house, after the challenges of being confined to home in a lockdown.Prices are rising in much of the western world, so it is not an NI-specic phenomenon. But the financial climate in which these home value increases are occurring is an abnormal one. Governments have flooded their societies with money to stave off economic disaster from Covid, and interest rates are exceptionally low.This is causing problematic side effects such as society and businesses taking on too much debt and high inflation — the perils of which Dr Esmond Birnie describes opposite.Excessive house price inflation can be as harmful as general inflation.Among other problems, it shuts young people out of home ownership, and that is good for neither them nor society at large, which has to deal with their understandable sense of exclusion and resentment.

Unionism withdrew, resigned MPs and stopped engagement, yet the Anglo-Irish Agreement remained. It wasn’t replaced until the Belfast Agreement was negotiated in .

Northern Ireland is crying out for political and economic stability yet the protocol has delivered the opposite as has threats by the DUP to collapse Stormont.

An earlier estimate, based on survey data in , valued such trade at £. billion https:www.nisra.gov.uk sites nisra.gov.uk files publications Overview-of-NI-Trade-Factsheet-August-.pdfWhat this means is that the levels of trade this year, represented by theand the CSO as a bumper increase, are in fact precisely at the levels which NISRA and HMRC would lead us to expect from the previous year’s data. What could have gone wrong in encouraging the CSO to make claims of a big increase The clue may be in an obscure document published by the CSO on  July , headed Information Note on Revision to Trade with Northern Ireland https:www.cso.ie en releasesandpublications in gei informationnoteonrevisiontotradewithnorthernireland . It explains that “From st January , all trade in goods with Great Britainmust be reported to Revenue’s Customs declaration systems.

So there’ll be subsidised tests available, but I think we have to go further than that.“We need very clear communications for people on how to use them because they do have a role to play.“They’ve an important role to play. There’s no silver bullet, be it boosters or antigen testing or anything.”He said the final details on subsidising the antigen tests will be worked out soon.“It’s not going to be cheap to do,” he said. “The initial figures I have are that it could be several hundred million euro.“The advice I have is that they shouldn’t be free.

It’s kind of inevitable.“What’s interesting in the Irish situation is that it’s become quite dramatic in the last week or two.“But it’s not so bad that I’m in a position of saying ‘oh terrible, terrible’.“You’ve got these surges coming up, you’ve got health services quite stretched, but the feeling is that the Government has a pretty clear idea of what’s going on, and that there will have to be perhaps some restrictions on what people do.“But I don’t get a feel that you’re heading into stringent lockdowns again, I very much hope that won’t happen.”The Covid incidence rate in Ireland has soared to , cases per , people each week.Dr Nabarro told RTE’s Today with Claire Byrne that while some restrictions will be needed, he believes “it won’t be necessary to go into a complete lockdown”.He said that while the incidence rate is high, measures can be taken to avoid a full lockdown, which should only be used as a “last resort”.“What one needs to do is to really dissect very carefully to find out where is the virus being transmitted, in which age groups, as well as in which occupational groups and locations,” he said.“Once we’ve got a bit of an understanding about where transmission is occurring,to work with the communities that are most at risk and see whether there are ways of reducing transmission at that community level.“Then, to try to avoid going for a whole county or a whole country, stay at home, type lockdown.“The reason is thatwe have to go to lockdown, it absolutely has to be the last resort.“Lockdowns cause all sorts of other challenges in terms of how people feel when they’re confined at home.“Also, poorer people really tend to fare badly in lockdowns, because they can’t get the work they need, especiallythey’re in the informal economy.“So, let’s try to keep the numbers coming down without the full lockdown.”Dr Nabarro praised Ireland’s public health officials and said they were capable of introducing measures that would avoid the need for lockdown.He said: “The reason why I say I think that’s possible in Ireland is that I’m really confident that the public health people are able to work out what might be the most appropriate restrictions.“If things get really bad, yeah, they’ll have to go back into lockdown.“I’m just hopeful on the basis of what I’m reading now, that this this should not be possible, especially because of acting now and acting quite quickly.”IrelandStephen DonnellyCovid-Government  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularTunnels could be opened under Northern Ireland townCall to have SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly removed from Policing Board‘There was Irish state collusion with IRA in my dad’s murder -

He has been a very valuable asset to our union and will be sadly missed.Mr Pricersquos contribution will be acknowledged at the Annual Glamorgan County Dinner that is being held at Cardfrsquos Angel Hotel on Friday November .More than  guests and dignitaries will attend the black-tie dinner, with glasses raised to the Glamorgan first team who beat Devon last month at Long Sutton Golf Club in the final of inter-county league.It had been a long wait since , but the convincing - victory in Somerset - which came after Glamorgan topped their group with just one defeat in the entire season - was the perfect way for Mr Price to bow out of the role.As well as the first team, Price has assisted in running the junior teams and the seniors team. In his time working across these generations, he has steered the union on to a more secure financial footing, attracting new sponsorship and promoting all aspects of the game in the county.OTHER NEWS:Backed by a streamlined executive committee, Mr Pricersquos influence has seen coaching notably improved at all age groups. He has unashamedly been keen to increase the focus on junior golf, introducing handicap events for a section that now starts from under-s..removeIn this unpaid role, Mr Price attended most matches at all levels, spending hours supporting the teams on the course and in committee meetings to ensure they received the necessary backing.ldquoIt has been an honour and a privilege to be involved with the Glamorgan County Golf Union and I will look back with great fondness on the many happy hours with friends and colleagues over the last nine years, Mr Price, a four-handicapper said.ldquoIt is time to concentrate on my own golf game for a while, but I wish the county continued success and hope I will be able to renew my association in some way in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The hallucinations can be simple patterns but can also be complex images including events, people, places or animals.As part of todays Charles Bonnet Syndrome Awareness Day, charity Guide Dogs has released an animated video which tells Mr Foyrsquos story to help raise awareness of the condition.Mr Foy, who has congenital glaucoma and has always had limited vision, said: ldquoLiving with Charles Bonnet has been really dficult. Not many people I speak to have heard of it before, and assume the hallucinations are a sign of a mental health problem, rather than linked to sight loss like in my case.ldquoAt one point I was slipping into depression and the hallucinations were making things worse. But speaking to Guide Dogs saved me. Diana Evans, an orientation and mobility specialist for the charity took the time to listen and reassure me. The best thing I did was talk about it.MORE NEWS:The animated film explains what its like to live with the condition and reveals the wide iety of hallucinations Mr Foy experiences every day,including seeing his daughterrsquos plaits as wiggling fish out of water when she moves, or seeing a dragon when he opens a hot oven.Mr Foy has a guide dog called Mason, who he says keeps him safe and grounded.In , the retina in his left eye detached and, while he experienced some hallucinations as a teenager, they then increased dramatically and his brain would conjure all sorts of visions to fill the darkness..removeMr Foy said: ldquoI hope that this film will raise awareness of Charles Bonnet Syndrome and also encourage others with the condition to reach out to Guide Dogs for support.Ian Morris, national head of adult services at Guide Dogs, said: ldquoDespite so many people with sight loss experiencing Charles Bonnet Syndrome, there is very little awareness or understanding.ldquoIt is thought that the hallucinations are the brainrsquos response to the gradual loss of information it received from the eyes and so is trying to fill in the gaps, therefore drawing comparisons with lsquophantom limb syndromersquo in amputees.ldquoAt Guide Dogs, our mission is to increase the independence of people with sight loss. We hope that by sharing Nathanrsquos experience in the form of this animation, we can raise awareness of the condition and reduce stigma, and let people know of the support available from Guide Dogs.If you require more information or help from Guide Dogs, you can contact them on the Guide Line telephone service on    or visit https:www.guidedogs.org.uk getting-support Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe Department for Transportwill, on Thursday, publish its Integrated Rail Planfeaturing pound billion of investment in the Midlands and the North which is expected to show major revisions to previously announced goals.While the Government has touted the programme as part of its move towards levelling up the country, it is expected to confirm the eastern leg of HS will be scrapped between the East Midlands and Leeds.Concerns have also grown over expected work on east-west connections across the North, known as Northern Powerhouse Rail , which are likely to involve a combination of new track and upgrades to existing infrastructure.Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, who is also the MP for Leeds West, said it seems that promises made in four successive Conservative manestos to bring HS to Leeds and Yorkshire will be scrapped today.She told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoWhat we are getting is tinkering around the edges rather than the proper transformation of transport in the north of England.ldquoAlready Yorkshire has the lowest level of capital investment in transport than anywhere in the country.ldquoCapital investment in transport in the north of England is half the level that you see in London and the South East.ldquoWe have been badly done by for many years now. vw,vw,px, px\"Shadow secretary of state for transport Jim McMahon told Times Radio the North is being betrayed by the decision to scrap part of the HS extension.He said: ldquoWe want to hold the Government to account for the promises that they made because it goes beyond actually just transport investment. It goes to the heart of politics.Writing in the Yorkshire Post, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Governmentrsquos planned investments would still mean ldquofaster journeys, to more places, more quickly for Yorkshire, while confirming a new study to plan how best to eventually link Leeds to the HS network..removeThe Post reported the IRP was expected to confirm the HS route to Leeds would be axed in favour of a Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway line.High-speed trains would travel on slower track to Sheffield, meaning HS trains would reach Yorkshire but the high-speed line itself would not, the paper said.In his column, Mr Johnson wrote: ldquoHS will come to Sheffield, meaning a trip to or from London will take just one hour  minutes ndash precisely the same as under the old HS plans.ldquoWersquoll look at how to get HS to Leeds too, with a new study on the best way to make it happen.ldquoBut high-speed rail is grindingly slow to build. Under the original blueprint, first drawn up more than a decade ago, Yorkshire would have not have seen the benefits of our investment until at least the s. Levelling up canrsquot wait that long. And towns like Wakefield, Doncaster, Dewsbury and Huddersfield would have suffered as trains were taken off the existing main lines.The DfT insisted it will ldquotransform journeys to and between the East and West Midlands, Yorkshire and the North West, with benefits delivered ldquoup to  years sooner.It said in a statement that ldquothe full HS and Northern Powerhouse Rail schemes as originally proposed would not enter service until the early to mid-s.One of the aims of the IRP was to increase capacity and have more frequent services ldquoin a way that presented value for money for the taxpayer, according to the department.ldquoFrom London and across the Pennines, the IRP delivers journey times which are the same as, similar to or faster than the original HS and Leeds-Manchester proposals, while doubling or trebling capacity and ensuring passengers and consumers benefit from tangible changes more quickly.The Government-commissioned Oakervee Review warned in  that the final bill for the entire Y-shaped network of HS could reach pound billion.Phase  will run between London and Birmingham, and Phase a between Birmingham and Crewe.Phase b was due to extend the line between Crewe and Manchester, and between Birmingham and Leeds, although the later stretch is expected to be curtailed..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Rail plans  utinkering around edges not transformation of transport in the North u article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A motion to ban MPs from holding second jobs outside parliament as paid lobbyists or political consultants has failed. MPs voted by a majority of  votes to reject the motion which had been put forward by the Labour Party following the recent Tory sleaze row and the government’s handling of the Owen Paterson case. Boris Johnson had instructed his MPs to vote against the Labour motion, with a following Conservative amendment passing through a majority of  votes. Labour leader Keir Starmer announced that the party would be tabling a motion to call for a ban on MPs being able to hold “any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant”. It came after huge backlash over the Owen Paterson row and the accusation that the Conservative government had ed to a policy of “sleaze”. Johnson had previously instructed Tory MPs to vote against the immediate suspension of former MP Owen Paterson, who had been found by the parliamentary standards committee to have broken lobbying rules while working as a consultant and earning £, per year. The committee had recommended that Paterson serve a -day suspension, however his suspension was initially blocked after a vote in the House of Commons, where a reform of the parliamentary standards committee was also voted through. The government was forced to do a hard u-turn on blocking Paterson’s suspension following intense backlash from opposition parties and the public, with critics claiming that the incident had heralded ato “Tory sleaze”. As a result of the incident, Labour took the opportunity to table a motion which banned the paid employment of MPs in positions consultancy and advisory role outside of parliament. At a vote in the House of Commons on  November, the motion was rejected by  votes to . Despite rejecting the motion with a majority of  votes, the vote showed that Boris Johnson’s majority on the issue had decreased. Many Tory MPs abstained from voting against the controversial motion, while four Conservative MPs - Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone, Nigel Mills and Dan Poulter - rebelled against the party and voted in favour of the ban on certain kinds of second jobs. Upon the announcement that a Labour backed motion calling for a ban on paid lobbying and consultancy role for MP would be tabled, Johnson tabled an amendment. The amendment described the ban as “the basis of a viable approach” and called on the Standards Committee to update the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Labour called the motion a “watered down” version of the original amendment. Despite the original motion being rejected, the amendment passed with  votes to zero, with Labour MPs abstaining from the second vote. A Government spokesperson said: “The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.“This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.“This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.”Following the vote and rejection of the Labour motion, Starmer said: “We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics.“Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesn’t get.”“We are not going to back down from these proposals, we’re not prepared to have them watered down, so we will press on with them.“But it is unbelievable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"junior reporter needed to interview the fureys ","story":"Jake Bailey-Sloan: Tributes to young Portadown businessman ‘one of the kindest souls you could ever meet’   Appeal after assault on traffic wardenNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleJunior reporter needed to interview The FureysWe’re on the lookout for a junior reporter interested in the unique assignment of interviewing members of top Irish folk band, The Fureys.By Valerie MartinMonday, th November , : am  \"       \"  The Fureys, will be performing at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Saturday, January  and in advance of this showpiece event, we are giving one young person a unique opportunity to interview Eddie and George Furey from the band.The interview will take place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday, December .

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbaddebabde   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_adaddfccce   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
