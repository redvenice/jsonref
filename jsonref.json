Katherine Rundell on how the best of them can ignite the imagination of all readers, whatever their ageI have been writing children’s fiction for more than 10 years now, and still I would hesitate to define it it is a slippery, various, quicksilver thing. But I do know, with more certainty than I usually feel about anything, what it is not: it is not exclusively for children. When I write, I write for two people, myself, age 12, and myself, now, and the book has to satisfy two distinct but connected appetites.My 12-year-old self wanted autonomy, peril, justice, food and above all a kind of density of atmosphere into which I could step and be engulfed. My adult self wants all those things, and also: acknowledgments of fear, love, failure. So what I try for when I write – failing often, but trying – is to put down in as few words as I can the things that I most urgently and desperately want children to know and adults to remember.Those of us who write for children are trying to arm them for the life ahead with everything we can find that is true. And perhaps also, secretly, to arm adults against those necessary compromises and heartbreaks that life involves: to remind them that there are and always will be great, sustaining truths to which we can return.When you read a children’s book, you are given the space to read again as a child: to find your way back, back to the time when new discoveries came daily and when the world was colossal, before your imagination was trimmed and neatened, as if it were an optional extra. But imagination is not and never has been optional: it’s at the heart of everything, the thing that allows us to experience the world from the perspectives of others, the condition precedent of love itself. For that we need books that are specifically written to give the heart and mind a galvanic kick – children’s books. Children’s fiction necessitates distillation at its best, it renders in their purest, most archetypal forms hope, hunger, joy, fear. Think of children’s books as literary vodka.Above all, children’s fiction spoke to me, and still speaks to me, of hope. The books say: look, this is what bravery looks like. This is what generosity looks like. They tell me, through the medium of wizards and sexy Jesus lions and talking spiders, that this world we live in is a world of people who tell jokes and work and endure. Children’s books say: the world is huge. They say: hope counts for something, bravery will matter, wit, empathy, love will matter. These things may or may not be true. I hope that they are.WH Auden wrote, in an essay on Lewis Carroll: “There are good books which are only for adults, because their comprehension presupposes adult experiences, but there are no good books which are only for children.” I would not suggest that adults read only, or even primarily, children’s fiction. Just that there are some times in life when it might be the only thing that will do.The Paddington books by Michael Bond There’s a vivid and obvious lesson in Paddington, about refuge. Paddington turns up at our door, with nothing to commend himself but his existence and his excellent hat, and we must take him in. We must cherish him, because he lives – and Michael Bond is telling us, like William Blake before him, that everything that lives is holy.But there’s more: for Bond, I think, structure is a form of metaphor, and the stories can be read as parables. So each inidual Paddington story usually has some kind of mishap: for instance, Paddington drops a sandwich a man slips on it. Disaster! But then the man proves to be a burglar, and his stolen goods spill out at the bear’s feet: triumph! The books tell us that if we zoom out we will see that inside each disaster there is a cog, propelling us towards potential goodness. Baked into the structure of the stories, small as they are, is Bond’s colossal central truth: larger than the world’s chaos are its miracles. Paddington asks us to trust, if only for a brief gasp, for the length of the book, in the world’s essential nobility. The books are oxygen for those, like me, who doubt.His Dark Materials trilogy by Philip PullmanLyra, Pullman’s ferocious heroine, one of the greatest ever written, a girl with quick wit and tooth-and-claw loyalty and a loose hand with the truth, voyages to the underworld. At first, on meeting the harpies who guard the realm of the dead, she lies – tells them what she thinks they want to hear. The harpies go for her, e‑bombing her and scraping at her skull with their talons. And so instead, she tells her own story: about pain, loss, hope and grubbiness, love and mistakes. The harpies listen. Lyra’s companion asks why they did not attack, this time: “‘Because it was true,’ said No‑Name. ‘Because she spoke the truth. Because it was nourishing. Because it was feeding us. Because we couldn’t help it. Because it was true.’”The harpies make a bargain: if each soul has paid heed to the world and has a story to tell of it, and they tell it truly, they will be led through the darkness to the other side. Rigorous attention, wakefulness to the world’s beauty, for Pullman, is what life demands of us. He has that in common with the philosopher Iris Murdoch, another writer I love, who decreed that attention was the foundation stone of love. We must learn, in Pullman’s universe, to watch the world with intense and generous care. We must learn to tell stories, his books say, whether it comes naturally or not – because it is the best and sometimes the only way we have to exchange truth.Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak“But the wild things cried, ‘Oh please don’t go – we’ll eat you up – we love you so!’“The wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws but Max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye.”There are as many interpretations of Where the Wild Things Are as there are people who have read it, and it means something very different when you are 30 from what it meant when you were three. I think it’s about the ferocity of love about how we devour each other, and are devoured.It’s also about, I think, the stark strangeness of the world. Max returns home to find his dinner “was still hot”. According to Sendak, his editors wanted him to cut or change that line, because it was impossible – or at least to edit it, to a more believable, “and it was still warm”. In an interview, he said: “‘Warm’ doesn’t burn your tongue. There is something dangerous in ‘hot’ … Hot is the trouble you can get into. But I won.” The world is, after all, rampantly strange. Children deserve books that are so too.One Dog and His Boy by Eva IbbotsonIn a world that prizes a pose of exhausted knowingness, children’s fiction allows itself the unsophisticated stance of awe. Eva Ibbotson escaped Vienna in 1934, after Hitler declared her mother’s writing illegal her work is full of an unabashed astonishment at the sheer fact of existence. In One Dog and His Boy, Hal, a child with everything he could wish for except love and care, releases five dogs from the cruel Easy Pets agency. He and his friend Pippa and the small sea of dogs go on the run to his grandparents’ home.On the way, each dog finds the place in which they can be themselves the Pekingese Li-Chee, who once guarded the temples of monks, lying at the feet of a girl in a foster home Francine the poodle, a natural comedian, performing in a travelling circus. It’s a story about finding your place and your people about not pausing or doubting until you find them.It’s also, like many of Ibbotson’s books, a shot across the bow at an increasingly consumerist world Hal’s parents shower goods on him, “a gift pack from Hamley’s and another from Harrods … but in the whole of the house there was nothing that was alive”. It’s a sharp attack on the tide of acquisition that threatens to swamp us to keep your neck above it, the book tells us, you must find something alive to love, be it beast or man, and hold on with both hands. Keep close, because the world will be cold, and frenetic and plastic, and only with each other will we make it.I love Peter Pan for being so entirely itself, not a diluted version of some other, adult thing. It offers up to us its own defiant logic, for Neverland is the place of the free experiment of the imagination. “Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingos flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.” And I love Peter himself: Peter is joy but he’s also a threat: he’s the id and the ego, the danger of being kidnapped by desire, he’s dark and capricious. He’s Pan.Barrie would argue that adults cannot go to Neverland. He writes: “On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. We too have been there we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.” We adults, Barrie tells us, cannot return to that same reckless and freewheeling imagining. I disagree: I think the books summon up inside us the riotous, Panian parts of ourselves. I think, with Barrie’s aid, and with those who have come before and after him, we can sail back to those shores.There might be another lesson, too. Captain Hook, first name James, is an Old Etonian. Barrie writes: “He had been at a famous public school and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned … he still adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch.” Hook, in his dying moments, thinks of his childhood: of “the playing fields of long ago … or watching the wall-game from a famous wall”. In Barrie’s play version of the story, it is even more explicit: Hook’s last words are “Floreat Etona”, or “May Eton flourish”, the school’s motto.James Hook has been told he deserves everything, and when he does not get it, he attempts to bring destruction to Neverland, in the hope that from its chaos he shall rise. He has elaborate hair, “dressed in long curls”, and “he was never more sinister than when he was at his most polite, which is probably the truest test of breeding”. Beware, the book tells us, pantomimic Old Etonians with unruly hair, who prize good form above truth, and who would seek to rule.• Why You Should Read Children’s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise is published by Bloomsbury.

Income comes from leasing space on each mast to other companies to allow them to fix equipment to provide mobile services to their customers for an annual fee.“We are now creating Europe’s largest tower company,” said Nick Read, Vodafone’s chief executive. “Given the scale and quality of our infrastructure we believe there is a substantial opportunity to unlock value for shareholders.”The new company, which will have its own management team, will be operational by next May.Vodafone began evaluating a spin-off of the towers business last year after receiving several offers for various parts of its portfolio. The company said it intends to monetise a substantial proportion of TowerCo within the next 18 months. This will include a potential flotation on the stock market, the sale of a minority stake in the whole business or in its mast operations in inidual countries, depending on market conditions.The proceeds will be used to pay down Vodafone’s mounting debt pile, which will reach €48bn when the company completes its €18.4bn deal to buy Liberty Global’s German and eastern European cable assets.Vodafone has also spent €4bn on 5G spectrum as prices ballooned in auctions in Germany and Italy during the past year.“Yes, Vodafone will lose the profits associated with running the towers, but it will also remove the €200m of annual spending tied up maintaining and expanding the network,” said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “So it’s easy to see the logic for the deal, especially since the group’s debts are fairly pressing.”The share price rise will be a boost to Read who has seen the company’s value fall by more than a fifth since he took over the role of chief executive last October. In May, Read was forced to cut Vodafone’s idend for the first time since it became a standalone business in 1990, despite having initially said he would not do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e35eb6f3113ee2b5143e7cacf1eea7e77566f666/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ff34dd32180508f34710735662deea0","title":"the dramatic transformation of britains canals photographs then and now","story":"See how Britain’s waterways have changed from industrial corridors to spaces for living and leisureby  Claire Burke and  Jo BlasonIn their industrial heyday, canals were bustling scenes of trade and commerce in Britain’s cities.

One layer down and the city has become an entirely different place.I, like many, am using the canal as a quiet cut-through. It smells different down here there’s the dankness of the water, for sure, but there’s a wealth of green filtering the fumes from above. And the soundscape changes – song birds, the curious grunt of a bank of geese eyeing me and the dog warily, the lap of the water’s edge and the groan of metal sidings that are there to repair the bridge.Today the canal is a shortcut to another part of the city, but the canals also represent an escape for me. There’s a freedom to this space that feels unpoliced by normal city rules. When I am kayaking they become an adventure playground, a way to get to part of the city you can’t reach on foot. A place to meet fellows, human or otherwise, that you might not find elsewhere.The life down here is distinctly feral. There are men fishing, some for fish, some for metal. I’ve seen a man using a huge magnet on a thick line of rope to trawl the canal floor for treasure. There’s a trail of unwanted, rusting finds a child’s bike, a ner, bolt cutter, a pulley, rod bars and what looks like a rotting safe, a screwdriver, endless bike locks and a horse shoe. The archaeology of the canal in rusted orange.Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic – and newly costly.\u0026nbspAs commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain’s cities,  Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.The horse shoe will no doubt date to the 18th century, when barges were towed by horses, ponies, donkeys and mules. The pulley from a warehouse loading bay and the bike locks symbolise something eternal about canals, they can hide a multitude of sins and secrets.The wildlife is feral, too, for however pretty and picturesque the towpath edge appears, fecund in dog roses and elder, thick with blackberries, buddleias and alders and waterlilies, it is also uncultivated, these wild things taking back the margins.Some are distinctly prosaic, dandelions and verges of selfheal, and others utterly unexpected – a bank of redcurrants dangling over the water, a thicket of figs full of fruit and an untamed apple orchard from thrown-away cores.This wild nature that sprouts from the cracks in the towpath and between the bricks in the bridges is in spite of us. For these are some of the most heavily polluted areas we’ve created in cities. At the height of their construction in the 18th century, canals ran like trunk roads, zigzagging across the country, following natural contours but serving the greatest catchment area for trade purposes. You can roughly date a canal to pre- or post-1750s by whether it is narrow and meandering or ramrod straight and wide.The more experienced and sophisticated engineers, such as Thomas Telford and William Jessop, constructed less scenic but more efficient canals that cut a straight line through, rather than around, obstacles using aqueducts, tunnels, high embankment and deep cuttings. They were shorn out of the industrial revolution’s landscape, giving them their nickname the Cut, as they were blasted through Triassic rock faces.Where today we might see banks of trees towering over the water, there would have been wall-to-wall buildings, the air thick with coal smoke and the water full of factory run-off. The bottom layer of silt in the canal is still full of heavy metal pollution from the period.For this reason, the water is both beguiling and disturbing. In the right light it is as pretty as can be, dazzling the red brick buildings around it, bouncing light into hidden corners, beckoning you forth. But stare too deeply into its depth and you glimpse its murky otherworld. For a long time in Birmingham, the canals were known as Dead Dog Ditch. They have unforgiving sides with deep ledges that are not meant for climbing out of, and there are countless tales of souls lost to the water.In modern history the canals have been claimed by runners and canoeists, by cyclists and strollers as valuable green spaces in cities. But we are merely gentrifiers of our own forgotten space: the hard work has been done by many things down in the dark recesses of the bottom of the canal. Duck mussels filtering through the heavily polluted industrial sludge, cleaning the water as they sup, waterlilies pumping oxygen down to the root layer so that small water creatures can creep, and carp, bream, rudd and roach can dart away from predators such as pike and eel. And with these come kingfishers, water voles and shrews, cormorants and the long, heavy swoop of grey herons.Nature has reclaimed her ground in our most polluted industrial areas, a testament to her powers over our neglect.For me the joy of visiting the canals is that they are not static spaces, they are vibrant in summer, reflective in autumn and frankly too cold for paddling in winter, but they are like old friends. I hope their feral nature is never taken for granted.The canal revolution series looks at what our changing waterways reveal about modern British cities.

It looked and felt out of touch with the nation, symbolised by having just 17 female MPs and two from ethnic minorities backgrounds. He proclaimed the need for modernisation of both party and policies, pledging to move back to the centre and give the parliamentary group a makeover. This was resisted by his foes on the hard right, some of whom even attacked the proclaimed pursuit of environmental reform.Cameron’s modernisation worked on one level. Look at Boris Johnson’s cabinet and it is heartening to see four cabinet ministers from ethnic minorities sitting round the table. He succeeds the second female prime minister, a politician who once rightly questioned if her party was really “at ease with 21st-century Britain”, while women hold several key posts in the new government. More than one in five Tory MPs are now female – still far too few but a big advance – along with 19 from ethnic minorities and the same number saying they are gay or lesbian.Yet clearly these changes were cosmetic. The tragedy of the Tory party – and of Cameron’s catastrophic failure of modernisation – is that his capitulation to a fringe group of nativists has ended up leading to their takeover. Instead of rooting out the hard right, he ended up empowering them through a foolish referendum – and now they have moved the Tories into hideous terrain. Some call it a coup as Johnson’s cabal, spewing out hollow words of unity, drives out those with any doubts over no-deal exit from the European Union. Diversity has its limits in his new-look party.Johnson is using the populist playbook, inspired by his pals Steve Bannon and Donald Trump and in readiness for going to “the people” if he fails to deliver on Brexit by Halloween. Truth is expendable, detail does not matter, reality is for defeatists, facts for losers. This shameless approach to politics sets out to harden isions while relying on bluster, bravado and blaming other people for setbacks. The most significant lines in Johnson’s dismal speech on the steps of Downing Street were those talking about Brussels refusing to negotiate, clearly preparing the ground to shrug off personal responsibility for the disaster of no deal.Sadly, the trajectory for the Tories could not be clearer. The liberals have been routed, moderates defeated and doubters despatched to the backbenches – even if they are Jeremy Hunt, runner-up in the leadership fight, or Penny Mordaunt, a popular Brexiteer. Now we witness a political entity famed for pragmatism, fiscal responsibility and ruthless pursuit of power turning into a repellent nationalist force.The pugilistic Conservative party of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and Benjamin Disraeli is so scared by Nigel Farage’s return it is morphing into the Brexit party under its latest prime minister. This is why Priti Patel, a woman disgraced for undermining British diplomacy in the highly sensitive Middle East, and who until recently backed hanging, has been sent into the Home Office to toughen up their law and order credentials. This tactic might even win a snap election, especially if a splurge of cash is chucked around to win applause on police numbers, schools and social care – and Labour is foolish enough to keep Jeremy Corbyn as leader while failing to clarify its muddled position on Brexit. It is depressing to watch – made worse by the appeasers and captives who argued so strongly against no deal then instantly allowed personal ambition to override national interests. It seems the likes of Amber Rudd, Matt Hancock, Nicky Morgan and Jo Johnson have decided to ditch their principles for higher pay and power. Yet this government presents a test for every Conservative, just as Trump has tested all Republicans: do they endorse crass populism, regardless of cost to the country, or display the moral fibre to stand firm for their principles? History will judge turncoats harshly as any semblance of modernisation shrivels and dies.• Ian Birrell is a former deputy editor of the Independent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e05564dd00adcfc13d2ba36fc2c1a2f844302867/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6184b7146a54eafb1b5b149634991b","title":"google facebook regulation ftc settlement","story":"We need radical approaches to these companies. Our responses must be as broad and deep as these companies’ hold on our minds and pursesDuring the same 48 hours this week in which Facebook agreed to pay the largest corporate fine in the history of the US Federal Trade Commission for massive and repetitive violations of a similar agreement from 2012, and the US Department of Justice announced a sweeping antitrust investigation of Facebook, Google, and Amazon, the company also announced it’s doing better than ever.That’s one reason Facebook stock surged on Wednesday after the major announcements of regulatory intervention. Meanwhile, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, the other major target of government scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic keeps moving up both in market capitalization and revenue. No collection of scandals, errors, embarrassments, hearings, threats of regulation, fines, or public scoldings like this one seem to able to stall these two companies in their quest to become the operating systems of our lives.The world has never seen anything like Google. The world has never seen anything like Facebook.When pundits, legislators, and regulators propose interventions to curb the excesses of these companies, they invariably reach back in time for patterns to guide them. They try to compare a mid-20th-century US telephone company like AT\u0026ampT to a global collection of servers and algorithms that delivers links and advertisements to billions of people who are trying to find driving directions, weather forecasts, or to settle bar bets. They imagine – foolishly – that “data are the new oil” and compare John Rockerfeller’s Standard Oil monopoly of the late 19th century to a social networking service that allows 2.4 billion people to upload text, video, and images about their lives and politics.Nothing in human history has reached 2.4 billion people, roughly one out of every three living humans, with the regularity and influence of Facebook. The only company close to that influence is Google, which controls YouTube and its nearly 2 billion regular users. Both of these companies have developed advertising platforms that deliver carefully targeted messages more effectively and efficiently than anything else in the world. Alphabet in 2018 generated US$136.8bn in revenue. Facebook in 2018 earned nearly US$56bn in revenue. Alphabet and Facebook are among the five highest capitalized companies in the history of the world.While financial markets are neither rational nor efficient, they do capture the collective judgements (justified or not) of millions of amateur, professional, and institutional investors around the world. They do offer a rough sense of how seriously to take events in life story of a company. Clearly, those with money on the line understand that the long term belongs to Facebook and Google, even if the headlines in 2019 belong to these company’s critics.The immediate reason these news events did not turn against Facebook or Google is that the FTC folded and gave Facebook everything it could want. Beyond the fine, which would have been significant to all but about the 20 richest companies in the world (and Facebook is number five on that list), the settlement was an effort to avoid taking Facebook to federal court for breaking its 2012 pledges not to collect and share user data promiscuously with third-parties like Cambridge Analytica. The settlement is full of giveaways to and forgiveness of Facebook and its executives who knowingly and consistently violated that agreement (those violations are documented in the text of the settlement).Going forward, Facebook will have to do a better job (there is no way it could do a worse job) reporting its practices and violations to the FTC. So it could face penalties in the future. But those penalties are sure to be more meager fines.This follows on what could have been a major crackdown on Google for its anti-competitive actions back in 2012. After a significant investigation, the FTC staff recommended major penalties and restrictions on Google and that the commission take Google to court over violations of US law. The politically appointed commission itself voted unanimously to reject the staff recommendations and instead gave Google a complete pass. Meanwhile, competition regulators in the European Union have repeatedly found that Google violated the law with similar actions – but issued only meager fines on the company.Nothing about the FTC settlement, the pending Justice Department investigation, or the newly announced FTC investigation into Facebook’s anti-competitive practices are likely to address the core functions of Facebook or Google – the very reasons they are so special, so unprecedented, and so successful. For both these companies, the prospect of competition from any other service except perhaps WeChat, the largest social media platform in China, is a myth.These companies engage in massive and pervasive surveillance of uninformed users around the world. They take the raw material of sensitive personal data and to manufacture persuasion machines. Most of the time they persuade us to buy goods and services. Often they persuade us to cast a vote, take an action, or perhaps refrain from voting or acting. Mostly, they persuade us to keep going back to them for more and more service until we are completely dependent on them to function as social, commercial, and political animals. Until pundits and regulators take seriously the deep perversions of our public spheres we can’t address the problems these companies have generated. We need radical approaches to these companies. Our responses must be as broad and deep as these companies’ hold on our minds and purses."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54b978746540ec7d142ba6ab8dd285bb5436418/0_75_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34ee893abb1057af315eb32d181ef61c","title":"ottawa the ultimate seven day itinerary","story":"Where else can you cycle river paths, shop farmers’ markets, and watch city lights from a hot tub? Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays. Round your busy week off with a well-earned nightcap at Chateau Lafayette, also known as the Laff, Ottawa’s oldest tavern (it dates from 1849).Photography: Cole Burston for the  except lead image and the view from Gatineau Hills (Alamy)Plan your trip to Ottawa with Canadian Affair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2676025029dbd53e7a8b9bc22ad99b1abecdceb/1018_25_1979_1188/master/1979.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ff3df30d8c10f0dfe8d61283acdb47","title":"boy with a pearl earring walter raleigh is the new style icon for men harry styles henry kitcher","story":"Harry Styles leads the renaissance of the Renaissance started by model Henry KitcherCould it be the renaissance of the Renaissance?

In June, the single pearl earring popped up on the Givenchy catwalk at the Pitti Uomo springsummer 2020 showcase in Florence, and over the last month, several influential editors and street style stars have been photographed wearing one.Kitcher was given his first pearl by his mother, who “compared the likeness to a portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh at the National Portrait Gallery in London”, he says. “I wore it every day for a couple of years as I appreciated the gift and enjoyed the link to this great historical figure.”Hughes recommends the exotic black pearl by Hum and other single styles are available from Gucci to Asos, with prices ranging from £6 to £600, as well as markets like Spitalfields, where Kitcher’s first was found.While in the past, pearls have generally been confined to items such as cufflinks or tie pins, their current popularity is starting to extend beyond earrings to necklaces, which were seen at Kenzo, Comme des Garçons and former Brioni creative director Justin O’Shea’s new brand SSS World Corp.Glenville heralds it as a progressive evolution of style. “I love the fact that as a part of our examination of gender and masculinity, jewels are being rethought.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c22464666b6f85befe1b685f1c3afd7cd79b9d32/1314_1231_2422_1453/master/2422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0620a91bc19dd1e8d2915af3ed19dfbe","title":"how to wear a bucket hat","story":"The 90s revival continues apace, so don a bucket hat and channel your inner geezerLast month, GQ magazine published an article about the rise of “infantile adult syndrome” – dressing like a man-baby who looks as though their personal stylist moonlights at Nickelodeon.

He talks about juggling success with family life – and why he’s starring in a film about electricityMatthew Macfadyen was idling on the stoop of his boutique Manhattan hotel last month when a man walked past and said warmly: “I loved you in Billions.” Macfadyen, at 44, is one of the handful of male British actors on US TV – among them Benedict Cumberbatch, Dominic West and the actor for whom Macfadyen was mistaken, Damian Lewis – whom to American eyes can appear indistinguishable. “Thank you!” he replied, cheerfully. (Macfadyen is extremely polite, and inclined to be grateful for any recognition at all.) “Then he came back two minutes later and said: ‘Succession! So sorry.’” He roars with laughter.Tom Wambsgans, the role Macfadyen plays in Succession, is robustly against type. In the 14 years since he played Darcy to Keira Knightley’s Elizabeth Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, Macfadyen’s career has leaned heavily towards period drama. He did Anna Karenina and Little Dorrit. When the pilot script for Succession reached him, he had just played Mr Wilcox in the BBC adaptation of Howards End. Tom, the ambitious, oleaginous husband to an Elisabeth Murdoch-type heiress was as far from these foppish roles as Macfadyen could get, a gift even before the show took off. “I thought: ‘I don’t know if this is going to have a life and I don’t know where the characters are going to go. But it’s clever and farcically funny.’” At the very least, he thought, “it’ll show I can do an American accent”.In the event, Succession was one of the breakout hits of last year a smart, funny, compulsively watchable drama about Logan Roy, an ailing media plutocrat, played by Brian Cox, and his furiously competing adult children. It was created by Jesse Armstrong, of Peep Show and The Thick of It, and combined the feel of a stately, prestige HBO show with the savage compound-swearing that is recognisable to anyone who loves Armstrong’s work. “It’s very caustic,” says Macfadyen, “which you recognise as a Brit.” In spite of the show’s American characters and setting, he is right when he says “there’s a British sensibility to it”.We are in a restaurant in midtown Manhattan during the last days of Macfadyen’s three-month stint filming the show’s second season. At the end of the week, he is due to fly to Croatia to film episode 10 and then home to London to his family: his wife, Keeley Hawes, and their two children, Maggie and Ralph. The last time I saw Macfadyen, he was in New York filming season one of Succession and Hawes was in the UK riding out the fuss around her BBC drama Bodyguard. Now, with Macfadyen’s success in the US – albeit more muted than British hysteria around Bodyguard – their positions are reversed.“It was peculiar,” he says, of the fuss surrounding his wife’s show. “Richard Madden couldn’t leave his house! There was a WhatsApp group in his street, with friends saying: ‘It’s bad today, stay in.’ It was really bonkers.”Succession is a vastly superior show and, along with the other actors, Macfadyen is excellent in it. As Tom, he plays a man of staggering venality and weakness who is nonetheless not wholly a monster. “While on one level, they are all revolting and the rest of it, they’re not amoral,” he says. “They’re doing their best with what they’ve got. And it’s a family, so instantly you’ve got a hook.” The occasionally ludicrous lengths to which characters go to achieve their aims are no more ludicrous, says Macfadyen, than real life. “Just look at what’s going on in the world now – people turning their backs in the European parliament. If they put that in a show, you wouldn’t believe it.”In spite of almost 20 years of solid visibility on UK screens, Macfadyen is unfailingly modest about his achievements. You do something good and then you wait, he says, and often nothing of value comes along. “I felt like I was treading water a little bit in the UK just before Howards End. I’d done a show called Ripper Street, in which I was a Victorian copper, which was lovely. But there were certain things I didn’t want to do after that I didn’t want to do an ITV drama, or thriller. That sounds snobbish, but you know what I mean. So you wait for a play or a movie.”One of the projects he said yes to was a movie with Benedict Cumberbatch called The Current War, the story of Thomas Edison’s race with George Westinghouse to “put a star in a jar” as Edison puts it in the movie, and be the first to provide the US with electricity. Macfadyen plays JP Morgan, who financed both men. It is a small, but satisfying, role in a gripping and beautifully shot movie that also tackles Edison’s grief at the loss of his wife. Watching the movie, you are struck by a sense of precedent: that, 100 years from now, similar projects will be made about the race to own the internet.Macfadyen has yet to see the result. “Does it work?” he says keenly. “Is it interesting? It’s quite a dry subject, if I’m honest.” He bursts out laughing. In fact, it does work and is oddly moving. The film is beautifully directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and co-stars Nicholas Hoult as Nikola Tesla, the eccentric third participant in the race, who memorably died broke and alone in a hotel room in New York. Macfadyen is suitably pompous as Morgan, and Cumberbatch plays the kind of twitchy, mercurial character he has come to specialise in – his performance as Edison is recognisably in the vein of Sherlock and Patrick Melrose.The story of the race to invent electricity was never going to break box office records, but, for Macfadyen, it came down to finding interest in that particular period of history and the chance to work with a terrific team.“I thought the script was good. I thought it would be fun – nice, prestigious, and with great people.” And JP Morgan was an interesting character. “He had this enormous bulbous nose, and wouldn’t let anyone photograph him. And he bailed out the economy, apparently. His house in London was kept staffed, and they made him a full breakfast every morning, in case he arrived unexpectedly. Then every morning, they cleared it away.”Last time we met, Macfadyen had talked about the disparity between his and his wife’s experiences of the movie industry, from the fact “there are just less parts for women, and there’s also a weird thing with women where you’re the ingenue, and then there’s a wasteland, and then you’re Hedda Gabler”, to the fact that “men are, by and large, paid more than women. I know this from Keeley – that the sort of excuse they’ll use is: ‘Well he’s done a few American things.’ And you think, well, no. It’s not to do with that. It’s cobblers.”He never had direct experience of Weinstein himself. But he and Hawes intuitively resisted moving to Los Angeles and immersing themselves more fully in Hollywood. “It didn’t seem like somewhere we wanted to live,” he says. The family came out to visit him in New York in half-term, but this time the novelty had worn off. “I’ve found it quite tough, this time, being away,” he says. “Partly because I haven’t gotten back as much as I did last time, but also I’ve done all the walks I don’t need to buy any more jeans. And if I have more than three of four days off and I can’t get back, I miss the kids.”The virtue of doing a series such as Succession is that there is a six-month break between seasons, during which time it’s conventional for actors to knock themselves out doing movie work or hustling for other high-profile projects. But after finishing season one of Succession, Macfadyen thought: sod it. “Keeley found herself busy in a bonkers way, and we had building work, and I just took the kids away. It was amazing. I took them to France for the whole summer. Maggie’s almost 15, and I was thinking: ‘She’s not going to put up with this for much longer,’ so we went and it was just heaven. Nothing was coming in for me and I thought: ‘Oh, fuck it, I’m just going to go.’”In some ways, that kind of concentrated time with kids may be better than snatched hours at the end of the day. “That’s what I say to myself when I spend weeks away and start to think: ‘Oh, God.’ But that summer was magic. And the rest of this year Keeley’s busy and I’ll be able to be there again. Being on their nerves.”Season two of the show feels even more timely than the first. These days, the dysfunctional Roy family puts you less in mind of the Murdochs than the Trumps. “There’s an absence of love, somewhere. And it all comes from daddy. They can’t really, truly, have any proper confidence in themselves even though they’re stuffed full of cash and can do anything.” Yes, if you’re raised by a narcissist, it’s no wonder you turn out like Ivanka. “Or those boys! Jesus Christ.”The news depresses him. “I don’t know where to put my frustration. I get into a ball of fury about it, and then I don’t know what to do with it. Someone said to me the other day, why aren’t people protesting in the streets about the children at the border? People sort of shrug and say: ‘What can you do?’ You feel powerless. There was a brilliant article by Jonathan Freedland about how Trump wants to be a dictator. And then you shrug and think: ‘Oh, it’ll be all right.’”He looks stricken. “Same with climate change. You know, ‘Someone will build a shield.’ Or, ‘Yeah, we’ll seed clouds in the sky.”Time to buy a house in Duluth, I suggest. He laughs. “Keeley was saying something like this the other day: what about finding a house in wherever? You need a well.”Macfadyen’s levity communicates the refreshing perspective that acting is really quite silly. Still, he says, when something is good it raises everyone up. “I really think that. I went to see Andrew Scott doing Hamlet a while ago, and I felt proud to be an actor. It was a great production. And it was a beautiful performance, not the terrible idiocy that it sometimes seems, but” – he looks surprised by his own conclusion – “thrilling.”• The Current War is out in the UK on Friday 26 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a922017d5ceabcee89a35c9d59eebb32c8c5558/0_145_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d0046721a99ca789c55c78711d20fb3","title":"how to make chapatis at home cooking tips kitchen aide","story":"To produce these beautifully pliable Indian flatbreads, and not paving slabs, a few precise steps are required ...Why is it so hard to make chapatis at home? I follow recipes to the letter, and buy the proper flour from a local Indian store, yet they always turn out like MDF. Am I missing a trick?Lizzie, Leeds“The key to chapati is the consistency of the dough,” says West-Country-based chef and food writer Romy Gill. “And if you are using true chapati flour, it’s vital the water ratio is correct, because it’s incredibly fine flour that goes very sticky very easily.”Once you’ve kneaded the dough, pop it in a bowl in the fridge for half an hour before you even think about starting to shape and cook chapatis, says Gill, whose debut book, Zaika: Vegan Recipes from India, is out in September. “The cold makes it go harder, which makes it easier to roll if you leave it at room temperature, it just gets wetter and stickier.”In other words, as with all bread-making, this is not the time for guesswork, even if you have years of knowhow. Sanjay Gour, co-owner with Nand Kishor of the much-acclaimed Dastaan in Epsom, Surrey (the pair previously ran the kitchens at the even more vaunted Gymkhana in London), goes a step further to stave off dry bread: “Put the dough in a lightly greased bowl, apply a very thin layer of oil to the top and cover with clingfilm – that will stop it from drying out and forming a skin.” Like Gill, Gour gives his dough at least a 30-minute chill, but adds that it’s advisable to leave the dough out to relax a little afterwards, so it’s more pliable and easier to ide into balls.Gour says another possible cause of Lizzie’s dry chapatis may be that she’s dusting them with too much flour when shaping. “Obviously, you need some flour, because this dough sticks to just about anything, but if you use even a bit more than you need, it will dry out and you’ll end up with dehydrated bread that’s not at all nice to eat.” If you’re in any doubt as to how much is too much, give the chapatis a good shake or two when rolling, just to be on the safe side.Gill adds that if you can’t get hold of chapati flour locally, you can make a pretty decent fist of it using plain or wholemeal instead. “I did a recipe for the Observer a few years ago that’s pretty foolproof.” But, she adds, a different flour requires a different treatment: “Rather than refrigerating it, keep the dough at room temperature, because it does the opposite of chapati flour dough.”Gill and Gour agree on another non-negotiable: brush one side of each cooked chapati with melted butter, then fold the bread over and cover with a tea towel. As Gill says, “This keeps them moist and soft, otherwise they’ll be like cardboard before the whole batch is cooked.”In India, many households make chapatis on a tava, or tawa – basically, a very flat, thin frying pan, often made of cheap steel or aluminium, designed for cooking all kinds of flatbreads, from chapatis to parathas and dosas (you can pick one up online for as little as a fiver) – but Gill says “a basic pancake pan works just fine”. Gour, however, prefers a flat griddle because, without the extreme heat of a professional hob, he reckons it’s better for getting the requisite char and blistering. “If Lizzie’s ever in Surrey,” he says, “tell her to pop over to Dastaan and we’ll give her a quick lesson.” I’m no Derren Brown, but somehow I foresee a fair few “Lizzies from Leeds” dialling Gour’s restaurant round about … now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/682389df9e353f0960b4d1b2ed78488d51497ea8/0_0_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb5dc7b770e74c3a2775de676f380d42","title":"bradford city heritage numbers first english football shirt","story":"For many football supporters, pre-season is a time of optimism. What lies ahead is the great unknown but is generally judged by the players who come and go. Some clubs, however, spend the summer not only rebuilding a squad but an entire organisation after a fallow period. Bradford City are one such example.Two years ago, Bradford were one game from the Championship now they are a League Two side after being relegated with a whimper last season. Their performances were overshadowed by the reign of the German chief executive Edin Rahic, who left last December after a two-and-a-half year spell amid demands from fans for him to go.Under Rahic – who reportedly wanted a say on all aspects of the club, from recruitment to team selection – significant damage was done. The new regime, spearheaded by the manager Gary Bowyer, has not only recreated a sense of optimism at Valley Parade but shown a firm desire to reconnect the club with its past in groundbreaking fashion.When the club starts the season at home to Cambridge a week on Saturday, there will be a different look to Bradford’s shirts. For years, the club has sported one star above its badge – in honour of their FA Cup success in 1911. Now underneath it, each player’s shirt will have a unique heritage number, underlining their place in the club’s 116-year history. As a lifelong Bradford supporter, I was delighted to be involved in the process.Going back to Bradford’s first game, in September 1903, it has taken almost two years for me to research and organise a list of every player to have played a competitive fixture for Bradford and put them in order. John Beckram was the first, Jacob Butterfield the most recent: No 1,278, to be exact. Between those two another 1,276 men, all placed in order of their official debut. And after any of Bradford’s signings make their debuts this season, they too will be awarded a number that will be placed on their shirt.“This project represents a cornerstone of our commitment to bring the club’s history to the forefront,” says Ryan Sparks, Bradford’s director of communications, who has secured EFL approval for the club to have the numbers printed on the shirts. England’s Test cricketers have a similar number on their shirts and numerous rugby league clubs have adopted the system – but Bradford are the first English football club to do it.“To be the first football club is magnificent,” Bowyer says. “Some magnificent footballers have played for this club and it’s vital we never forget them.” Bowyer has invested time into the project, as well as the history of the club he requested that the training ground be covered with profiles of Bradford’s greatest players this summer to emphasise the importance of history to his signings.“We’ve a massive rebuilding job at this football club, and part of that involves connecting the present with the past. These players need to know what this club is all about.”It is a stark contrast from the Rahic era. Some staff formed the view that he was opposed to dwelling on the club’s history, preferring to focus on the future and disregarding what happened before.“It goes without saying that the club had lost its way, and we’ve put a great deal of emphasis on repairing our image,” says Sparks. “Heritage numbers are common in rugby and cricket, and it’s something I implemented in a former role in rugby league. It’s surprising to see no football club has done it but we’re excited and honoured to be first. Since announcing it, we’ve been contacted by other clubs.”History is a vital part of Bradford’s DNA. Every May, generations of supporters meet in the city centre to pay tribute to the 56 people who lost their lives in the 1985 fire disaster. Bowyer spent the evening before what was the first memorial he has been involved in this year watching the documentary about the tragedy and is intent on ensuring that while he leads a rebuild of the club on the pitch, as much detail as possible is placed into matters concerning the rebuild off it.“Supporters have made me aware of important figureheads in the club’s past, and for us to be the first club to wear heritage numbers to honour those guys is just brilliant,” he says. Throughout Rahic’s tenure, Bradford created too many headlines for the wrong reasons. Now, they are at the forefront of something positive – and something which very conceivably will catch on elsewhere."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/209f5e89287c2ab54fef8905cb5575e77ed09b96/0_73_3519_2111/master/3519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80b8eb7ac4ecc07fb001f976a3757fa3","title":"gareth bale real madrid hero why gone wrong","story":"On the one hand, the massive imbalances of wealth within football are a terrible thing. On the other, they can lead to deliciously ludicrous morality tales. The hero is lured to a faraway kingdom by promises of unimaginable wealth and other heroes to hero around with. The hero heroes but perhaps not as heroically as some would like. Then the king decides he wants a new hero and that means this hero must leave. But this hero enjoys his luxurious life and does not want to go anywhere where there may be fewer other heroes to hero with and where the pillows may be less silken and the fairways less lush. Impasse ensues.This could be about Neymar and Paris Saint-Germain but it is about Gareth Bale and Real Madrid – and the fact the pattern repeats with such contrasting personalities suggests the problem is systemic rather than being about iniduals. The culture of superclubs has led to a cult of superplayers and the problem with superplayers is that only superclubs and Chinese franchises can afford them. When one tires of the other, there are very few places for the superplayer to go.Even after the cruciate injury suffered by Marco Asensio this week, Bale probably will end up leaving Real this summer. PSG (who need to resolve the Neymar situation) and Bayern Munich (who may need his wages subsidising) are interested. Jiangsu Suning have reportedly made an offer. Bale, sitting on a contract worth £600,000 a week for the next three years, is understandably reluctant to make any hasty decisions. But none of that explains the bitterness that now exists between Bale on one side and Real’s manager, Zinedine Zidane, and fans on the other.The argument that Bale has not integrated into Spanish life feels a little hollow. There are plenty of players who struggle with a new language who have been successful. And so what if he plays a lot of golf? There are many more damaging extracurricular activities that a footballer could indulge. Complaints about lifestyle tend to be symptomatic of a deeper dissatisfaction.Yet, on the face of it, Bale’s time at Real has been a success. There have been injuries – 72 games missed through 17 separate problems in his six years at the Bernabéu – but he has still managed 133 league starts. More than that, he has scored vital goals – three in Champions League finals, two of them vital game-changing strikes, and one of them arguably the greatest goal scored in a major final.Perhaps it is true Bale never quite got going in Spain, that there have been flashes and hints rather than sustained excellence, but equally there is more than enough material there to build a cult hero. There was enough for Real to offer him a six-year deal worth in excess of £150m in October 2016.The problem has perhaps been twofold: expectation and the absurd incoherence that so often afflicts Florentino Pérez’s content generator. Bale arrived in 2013 for a world-record fee as the designated successor to the previous holder of that accolade, Cristiano Ronaldo. But not only was he never the new Ronaldo, the old Ronaldo turned out to be nowhere near obsolescence as it had appeared.That created an immediate tactical problem. Bale had excelled in his final season at Tottenham cutting in from the left but that was the space occupied by Ronaldo. Bale ended up playing mainly on the right, an awkward accommodation that immediately raised the question of why a club would pay world-record fees for two players who wanted to play in the same position.As Ronaldo aged and stripped back his role back, so the opportunities for Bale to play as he had at Spurs became increasingly limited. What he needed was a 4-3-3 with a centre-forward who got out of the way, creating space for him to accelerate into. What he got was a 4-4-2 that generated much of its width from full-back and demanded a more patient technical style from its midfielders.In six years, Real have spent around £300m on Bale in transfer fee and wages and yet have almost never played him in the role in which he impressed them.Which is not necessarily to paint Bale as a victim, particularly if there is substance to the rumours Zidane’s increasingly militant stance has been prompted by Bale’s truculence in the latter part of last season. It is not as though Bale seized the opportunity when Ronaldo had finally cleared out of the way. Equally, while he cannot be blamed for insisting his contract be honoured, there is something a little depressing that that seems more of a priority than using his talents at the highest possible level for the handful of seasons that remain for him as a player. It is surely not how the Bale of that famous childhood photo, clad in his Real replica shirt, grinning awkwardly and raising his fingers in a victory sign, hoped it would turn out.Fundamentally, though, this is a problem of Real’s making: if you treat players like commodities, you cannot be surprised if they come to regard themselves as value-creation machines. The situation could be sad but really it is just silly: what actually, other than the dignity of the game, the dreams of children and the sense of sport as a noble pursuit in and of itself, has been lost?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd5a6c28a5f5e42f82af4248c56cde7147e42c82/0_107_5475_3284/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0a49bf2dacec5f62fd1d76673d977a4","title":"coco khan markets car boot sales bargains","story":"You never know what you’ll find inside a humble CD case or what human stories hang on a rack of clothesAs a teenager, my reward for helping Mum with the boot sale was five crisp English pounds. Five pounds to spend days packing stuff in boxes, only to wake up at the crack of dawn and fight with the car boot in a game of Ford Fiesta Tetris.My abiding memories are of blue-grey skies between night and day, naps in the back seat and brusque East End market traders who made even the campest fruit sound threatening (“Get your blueberries!”).But £5!

And it paid off: a mix CD that just had “Gaz’s Wedding” scrawled across in marker was how I first heard Buddy Holly. A DVD with the wrong disc was how I saw my first John Carpenter horror (that DVD was Free Willy – truly a child-scarring episode waiting to happen).I’ve never enjoyed a shopping experience as much. I thought for a while that I had simply grown too old to be enthralled by physical objects. But recently I drove past a cardboard sign reading “Boot sale this way” and ventured in. It was just as I remembered: a collision of sounds, smells and (probably) stolen goods. I passed a pile of dainty old dresses next to a Thighmaster, and wondered if the owner had hoped they might fit her again some day. I realised it’s not just the prices or the thrill of the rummage that I love, but people’s stories and the human closeness that comes from buying secondhand.

Quitting the minute that album two of a celebrated reunion is complete seems like an odd move. We can only guess at the backstage drama, but if we study music’s rich history of comebacks, can a band ever slot seamlessly back on track? The rock reunion story is as old as time: the wilderness was dark and tangled the bassist has crippling Foxy Bingo debts and the singer’s facing a ruinous sixth orce settlement everyone desperately needs this life-saving second shot to work, but there’s no creative momentum or fresh identity everyone’s pulling in different directions. Take Kim Deal, who left the re-formed Pixies to avoid tainting the legacy with new material, with subsequent Pixies albums bearing a Kim-shaped hole.Personal differences, too, never completely dissipate at the first whiff of a sizeable Festival Republic cheque. If you have ever got back with an ex you will know the pitfalls. Sure, they respect you now they’ve stopped mainlining tequila and started paying you back that bail money, but they still hum Toploader in their sleep. Likewise, your old bandmates might have quit smack and had their egos punctured by failed solo careers, but once the comeback chips are cashed and the new album slog begins, the tiniest old niggle – the singer’s aloof studio presence, the bus’s rankling odour of 1993 – sets things back again.Some splits are so acrimonious that no amount of separate dressing rooms, limos or backstage meditation zones can heal the ide. The Verve’s 1997 return was a powder keg of unresolved animosity, finally exploding after a year when Richard Ashcroft lobbed a beer bottle at Nick McCabe’s head another go in 2007 saw a bust-up between Ashcroft and bassist Simon Jones after the very first gig. The 2006 East 17 reunion barely lasted one gig before it became clear, via a fist-fight, that not everybody involved was still resident at the house of love.Then there was Flowered Up guitarist Joe Maher who, according to drummer John Tovey, so messed up a major reunion show in 2005 that he was “carted out by St John Ambulance in a straitjacket”. Actually, perhaps Weiss had the right idea after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d29ab9e36a31f016b1522ac3c524810780004a/0_0_3993_2662/master/3993.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=79e27a8bca46dc39d251fe4fd3169656 1760w","title":"priti patel earning 1000 an hour as adviser to firm supplying mod","story":"New home secretary has been working for communications firm Viasat as strategic adviserThe new home secretary, Priti Patel, holds a £1,000-an hour contract with a global communications firm that supplies products and services to the UK government, the  can reveal.Patel, who was appointed on Wednesday by the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a part of a wholesale gutting of the cabinet, has been working for Viasat for the past three months as a strategic adviser on a salary of £5,000 a month for five hours’ work a month.She recorded the role on the MPs’ register of interests, and the contract is due to expire on 31 July.Viasat, a Californian company with a UK base in Farnborough, supplies services and products to the Ministry of Defence (MoD).

The unprecedented coverage of both the Women’s football World Cup and the Netball World Cup have dictated this on an international platform. The rippling effect of the #thisgirlcan movement can still be felt almost five years on since it launched, the aim of which was to increase participation levels of girls and women in sport. In many scenarios, it is more than just a competitive game. It is a social space, where women can come together and set aside time for themselves. At club level, the sport s across generations, with many women in their 30s and 40s returning to the sport of their youth. The ever-growing popularity of the sport prompted Sport England to award it a 16.9m government grant in 2017, 10.5m of which was set to encourage women to take up the sport again.Netball has always been at the forefront of this push. Often the first sport many young girls are introduced to, teaching important lessons such as teamwork, competition and integration, we want to hear your netball memories and experiences.Did you watch the Netball World Cup?

Still you’ve got to do a professional job, and it’s fair to say we did that. The World Cup was long and quite gruelling at times, and mentally and physically you feel a little bit drained, but then you’ve got a Test match to get up for. You find something from somewhere, but then when you get 0 first innings and don’t bowl as well as you’d like, you’ve got to dig deep.I knew that was a lot of runs on that surface. We’ve been in this position before, against India at Edgbaston last year, so we knew we’d been able to manage a similar scenario. I thought it was very important that we stayed calm, in control of what we wanted to do and asked the right questions, and we did exactly that today.It was very pleasing, especially with the ball and the way we managed certain pressure situations through the game. I thought we managed pretty well. It wasn’t by any stretch the perfect game for us but sometimes that can be a really important part of your learning for a team, and I certainly think we’ll take a lot from this game. Ultimately we found a way to win and that was very important. There was a lot of different pressures around this Test match and to come out in the way we did today and close it out was very impressive.That was one of those things. We knew things were going to be tough when the lights were on and theree was a bit of drizzle in the air, but we had to try to get through that and get to this stage, when the sun’s out and the ball is 15 or 20 overs old and gone a bit softer. But fair play to the two lads, how they bold. They made it difficult. We knew we were going to dig deep, but they just kept challenging everything. Jack Leach is the player of the match:I think bowling three overs for 26 and I’ve got man of the match, I didn’t ever see that happening. I’m very pleased, and glad we got the win. I found some form out there, I just took one ball at a time and tried to do a job for the team. I got into the 90s and I got nervous, and didn’t really know how to go about things from there. I tried to not think about it but probably didn’t stop thinking about it from there.In four Tests at Lord’s, Chris Woakes has scored 274 runs at an average of 69 (career average 29) and taken 23 wickets at an average of 9.75 (career average 31). Rob Smyth’s statsmanship there.The last time only two England bowlers bowled and shared 10 wickets in an innings of a Test was in 1924 when Arthur Gillian and Maurice Tate took ten against South Africa in Brimingham. Mazher Arshad’s stats this time.This match will have produced a lot of stats. Here’s a few more:It’s over. The bowling was excellent, the slip catching immaculate, the batting a fair way below par.And that’s it! Tim Murtagh exhibits his full range of wild heaves and makes contact only once, getting two for his troubles on that occasion. Woakes eventually aims at leg stump Murtagh gives himself a bit of room and completely misses!15th over: Ireland 36-7 (McBrine 0, Murtagh 0) How Boyd Rankin survived that over is beyond me. Stuart Broad, one wicket from his own five-for and clearly desperate to get it before Woakes steals it off him, wheels out a string of zingers (and one loose one that whipped down the leg side), but somehow the ball keeps missing the bat, or missing the stumps. A wicket maiden, but he wanted two.The lowest Test total at Lord’s is 47, achieved by New Zealand in 1958.Broad gets McBrine! Another classic of the genre, moving gently away, taking the edge and it’s another good, low catch for Root.That’s a five-for for Woakes! Nicely caught by Root at slip, low to his right.13th over: Ireland 32-7 (Thompson 0, McBrine 0) That’s it from me, Simon Burnton is waiting to be tagged in. Please email him or tweet @simon_burnton. Bye!Seven down, three to go. Adair becomes the latest man to be bowled through the gate while trying to drive. It was another superb seaming delivery from Broad, who had been pulled for six off the previous ball. Although it is ending in disappointment, Adair has had a fine Test debut. 12.3 overs: Ireland 26-6 (Thompson 0, Adair 2) Adair, beaten for pace as he tries to pull, is smacked in the grille by a Broad bumper. That means another break in play.12th over: Ireland 26-6 (Thompson 0, Adair 2) Adair is beaten by three consecutive deliveries from Woakes. The ball is talking, and Ireland would rather it didn’t. One from the over: 6-2-11-4.11th over: Ireland 25-6 (Thompson 0, Adair 1) To the wise, a word: it’s probably safe to make other plans for the fifth day of this summer’s Ashes Tests.Kevin O’Brien is the latest man to go, pinned in front by another superb nipbacker from Broad. Bah.10th over: Ireland 24-5 (O’Brien 4, Thompson 0) A double-wicket maiden for Woakes, who has figures of 5-2-10-4. Another Woakes stat: he averages 22 in home Tests, 62 away from home.Ach, this really is a shame. Ireland shouldn’t be too hard on themselves, because England have bowled immaculately in very helpful conditions - similar to those in which the world’s best team, India, made 107 and 130 a year ago. In four Lord’s Tests, Chris Woakes has made his only Test century, his second highest Test score - and taken 21 wickets at an average of 10.80. Scratch that, he’s taken 22 wickets at 10.32! Gary Wilson has been given out LBW on review. He pushed outside the line of another beautiful delivery that hit him around the line of off stump. It was given not out but England reviewed instantly, and successfully. Both wicketkeepers, Wilson and Bairstow, have bagged a pair.Stuart Broad has been blindsided by Chris Woakes, who is bowling masterfully in helpful conditions. He has his third wicket now, which McCollum snicking a drive to first slip. It was another lovely full-length delivery that moved away to take the edge Root did the rest.9th over: Ireland 24-4 (McCollum 9, O’Brien 4) O’Brien is okay to continue. 8.4 overs: Ireland 24-3 (McCollum 9, O’Brien 4) O’Brien, lunging from the crease, thick edges Broad along the ground for four. The next ball is a beautiful bouncer that smacks into the helmet, which means an impromptu drinks break while O’Brien has a concussion test. He looks okay in the sense that he is walking and talking I have no idea whether he is concussed.Here’s more on the Australian Ashes squad. I see we’ve gone for the news angle.8th over: Ireland 20-3 (McCollum 9, O’Brien 0) The weather may have saved England from humiliation. The lights are on, which means conditions are very tough for batting, and so far the challenge has been too great for Ireland. Woakes almost gets his third wicket when Kevin O’Brien edges this far short of Root at first slip. “Woah there!” says Guy Hornsby. “I love an English cricket existentialist crisis as much as the next OBOer, but while there’s always infinite parallel universes of possibility (my favourite is the one where Mark Ealham led us to the 1999 World Cup final then invented T25 cricket) surely this is all way too close to the Ashes for anything meaningful. And while there’s a risk of a shellacking due to out of form andor shattered players, we’re going to have to give it at least a couple of innings defeats before we get all 90s on it (NB. I don’t think we’ll get all 90s on it.)”Oh yes, agreed. The fact is that, by tonight, they will probably have won 10 of the last 13 Tests. They might drop Rory Burns, who looks in woeful touch, but the rest of the squad will probably be as expected. It’ll be interesting to see which seamers are left out of the squad, never mind the team. Sam Curran and Olly Stone will probably miss out.The dream is dying for Ireland. {ail Stirling has gone second ball, cleaned up by Woakes. He was unsettled by the previous delivery, which trampolined absurdly from a length. The next ball was fuller, tempting Stirling into the drive, and it seamed back through the gate to hit the stumps.7th over: Ireland 18-2 (McCollum 9, Stirling 0) Broad has figures of 4-2-7-1. It’s been superb, aggressive stuff, which many on social media are calling the best spell of bowling in a Test match since Sir Curtly Ambrose at Trinidad in 1994.Broad gets a deserved first wicket, and I’m pretty sure won’t be his last. He has been harassing both batsmen, bowling with ferocious intent, and Balbirnie could not take the heat. He pushed at a good-length delivery that moved away off the seam to find the edge, and Root crouched to take a comfortable catch at first slip.6th over: Ireland 15-1 (McCollum 7, Balbirnie 4) Balbirnie push-drives his first ball stylishly down the ground for four. He’s the big wicket, I think, the man most likely to hit a matchwinning 91 not out. Later in the over he softens his hands to ensure an edge off Woakes falls well short of the cordon. Meanwhile, replays show that Broad LBW appeal would have been ‘umpire’s call’. Aleem Dar thought about it for a while, too.“The Sky bods are picking their Ashes teams and see Vince and Malan as the solution to England being three down for nothing, and having a middle order of No7s,” says Kevin Wilson. “I don’t imagine an Ashes series is the time to experiment and you probably have to go with what you know (two guys who’ll average 27 and get a couple of fifties) but I don’t think I’ve gone into an Ashes series since the bad old days with this little confidence (and I include the away series we were thrashed in!).”I can’t recall having less confidence in the batting – the lot, not just the top three – yet I still think England could win through bits-and-pieces batting and high-class bowling in favourable conditions. We say this every time, but the first Test is so important. If Australia win, on their bogey ground, things might get ugly.5th over: Ireland 11-1 (McCollum 7, Balbirnie 0) McCollum survives another big LBW shout from a Broad nipbacker. This was closer, and Aleem Dar thought about it for a while. It was probably going to be umpire’s call at best on height, and Root decides not review.Broad is bowling with the kind of furious purpose that evokes Sir Curtly Ambrose’s rampage at Trinidad in 1994. No, I am not a giddy England fan comparing figures of 0-4 with those of 6-24 Broad’s are far better. But there is a similar intent and, I suspect, a similar disgust at the possibility of a shock defeat. 4th over: Ireland 11-1 (McCollum 7, Balbirnie 0) “I think the days of the specialist captain have long gone,” says Mark Gillespie. “The pressure on a captain averaging 25 would very quickly be massive, even for someone as good as Morgan (for example).”You might be right, given the state of the modern world. But if you look at the England batsmen since the start of the last Ashes, an average of 25 wouldn’t be too far below par.Jonny Bairstow takes a marvellous one-handed catch to dismiss William Porterfield! He edged Woakes low between the keeper and first slip, and Bairstow plunged to his left to grab it just above the ground. That was similar to Alec Stewart’s famous grab to dismiss Brian Lara at Lord’s in 1995, although he didn’t have to go quite as far across. And it wasn’t Brian Lara. 3rd over: Ireland 11-0 (Porterfield 2, McCollum 7) Thanks for all your emails, which I’m trying to read between pleas for mercy from my brain and eyes. Broad starts his second over with another absurd jaffa that beats Porterfield, who then survives an appeal for a catch at second slip after being hit on the thigh. McCollum also survives a big LBW appeal later in the over. It looked like it was missing leg to me, and Joe Root decides not to review. Replays show England would have lost a review had they gone upstairs.McCollum ends a difficult over for Ireland on a high note with a thumping cover drive for four. Eleven down, 171 to go.2nd over: Ireland 6-0 (Porterfield 2, McCollum 3) A fine start for Ireland. The first ball of the mini-session, bowled by Woakes, is flicked confidently through midwicket for three by McCollum the next is driven crisply for two more by Porterfield. It would have been four but for a spectacular sliding save from Denly. File under: ‘If England win by one run...’“Andy Donald’s comment that ‘an Ireland win here will be met with little more than amused curiosity in Ireland’ is coming, as he says, from the perspective of a ‘long time Ireland fan’,” says John Mee. “I think myself that an Ireland win would have a big impact amongst those, like myself, who aren’t as knowledgeable as he is. Hard to see how it would fail to encourage youngsters to take an interest in playing the game.”Enough! It’s time for some actual cricket. “Hello Rob,” says Geoff Wignall. “I wouldn’t worry about being not very good at journalism  has always shown a sympathetic and accommodating approach. On the question of captaincy, one obvious answer is to allow Bairstow to identify the best available Yorkshireman. Otherwise, though his lack of recent runs is an issue I’d like to borrow Livingstone’s cap to throw into the ring.”Whenever they do pick a new captain, I can’t see them taking a flyer. It just doesn’t happen anymore. The more I think about it – and I’ve thought about little else these past 30 seconds – I’m sure Buttler will be the next Test captain if there’s a change this year.“It seems to be implicit in this captaincy discussion that we’re going to get crushed in the Ashes,” says Peter McLeod. “What are the good reasons to think we will be? Or are we all just being tremendously English about the whole thing?”Well, yes, that’s the thing – by tonight they may have won 10 of the last 12 Tests. But most of the team look shattered, out of form, not good enough or all of the above. For all that, it wouldn’t be a great surprise if England won the Ashes 4-1.“Rob,” says John Starbuck. “Re Mr Wallace’s views on bowlers as captains: it usually happens that when a bowler is appointed England captain, he doesn’t bowl himself nearly as much as he used to play. This applies to those who might be considered all-rounders if their bowling is sufficiently effective, so It’s not either spinners or speed merchants. If it’s the latter, though, he’s usually the senior pro. There’s a case to be made for wicketkeepers as captains since he’s the one to allocate bowling workloads, but also crack down on inaccuracy. Bowlers often pull their socks up a bit more in these cases.” “Who bats No5 and 6 for Australia from that squad?” says Andrew Hurley. “Can’t figure out Carey being omitted..”I suspect the team for the first Test will be something like: Warner, Harris, Khawaja, Smith, Labuschgne or Bancroft, Head, Paine, Cummins, Lyon and then two from Starc, Hazlewood and Pattinson. Play will resume at 12.30pmNathan Lyon is of course in the Australian squad. I missed him out, because I am not very good at journalism.“I seem to recall Glamorgan’s Tony Lewis being selected to captain, as a new England player, an overseas tour,” says Nigel. “He came back having averaged around 25. I don’t think he played for England again. Was that a good move?”Well, he averaged 38 and was left out after the first Test of the following summer. I’m not saying it’s a good move per se, just that I think it would be good for this particular team."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af37ea359f172f06b56dc5128b9e132dbb29135b/0_252_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fb941f6564055ceff21d7eefdd3d04f","title":"tour de france 2019 stage 19 live","story":"63km to go: Just the one chase group now as the five merge.Ineos’ Jonathan Castroviejo is currently at the head of the peloton, which is now 1:47 off the front. At this stage that gap is much less significant than the climbs that lie ahead.64km to go: The field fragments. There are now three groups ahead of the peloton. The leaders now number 21, with stragglers forming two chase groups behind. Aru, Kreuziger, Bettiol, De Gendt and Gesbert are those currently riding ‘tween front and yellow.66km to go: Official word on Pinot from Groupama-FDJ. The strapping was on a muscular injury that it was hoped would improve overnight. It evidently hasn’t. And thus: sad toodles to Thibaut.67km to go: Mollema is blowing. Fighting to the lead group has taken its toll and he’s currently riding an entirely different race to those around him.What do you think the chances of a BergalThomas duo attack, too risky? If they run ahead, leave it to the two of them for a sprint finish for who leads the team … As you can tell, I’m a bit of a dreamer. It would be the outcome Ineos fans want, whilst maintaining the newly unpredictable nature of this tour?I think the final climb is going to be mesmerising with this in mind. My suspicions for most of the race have been split evenly between suspecting Thomas isn’t in the form he needs, and waiting for him to explode for a huge effort on one of the mountain stages. There’s little clue of a team hierarchy on the stage yet, which is interesting.69km to go: More final day thoughts …71km to go: keep an eye on Uran and Valverde. EF Education First’s Uran isn’t the Colombian most thought would be prominent today, but these are the only two of the top 10 GC riders in the main group. The peloton had dropped to 75sec behind, but with the leaders riding into a headwind, it’s now down to 54sec. Expect that to grow again for a spell as the peloton find the wind brushing their ears. Cort’s lead evaporated almost as quickly as it opened up.73km to go: A couple more names to report in the lead group – Bauke Mollema (Trek-Segafredo) and Michael Matthews (Sunweb). Which I only realised as Matthews dropped off the back. He’s wincing, suddenly.Cort is having a go at the front. He’s opened up a 14sec gap.78km to go: The peloton edges back. Now back to a lovely round minute back from the lead group.On the final stage protocol front, lots of correspondence regarding the 1989 Tour, which ended with an inidual time-trial into Paris, out of which Greg LeMond emerged victorious. As with most things from the late-80s, feels like a different world now. An age thing, of course, but is the gap from 1989 to today really the same as that from 1959 to then? The Gap from Ben Hur to Lethal Weapon 2 … the same as from When Harry Met Sally and Hobbs and Shaw. Sorry, there’s a race happening …80km to go: The lead group now features 26 riders.Here’s who’s up front, now 62sec ahead of yellow jersey group … Dylan van Baarle (Ineos)Patrick Konrad (Bora-Hansgrohe)Tony Gallopin (AG2R-La Mondiale)Vincenzo Nibali and Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Merida)Sébastien Reichenbach (Groupama-FDJ)Alejandro Valverde, Marc Soler and Andrey Amador (Movistar)Pello Bilbao, Gorka Izagirre, Magnus Cort and Alexey Lutsenko (Astana)Laurens De Plus (Jumbo-Visma)Rigoberto Uran, Alberto Bettiol and Michael Woods (EF Education First)Simon Yates (Mitchelton-Scott)Dan Martin and Fabio Aru (UAE Team Emirates)Giulio Ciccone (Trek-Segafredo)Jesus Herrada (Cofidis)Guillaume Martin (Wanty-Groupe Gobert)Roman Kreuziger (Dimension Data)Warren Barguil and Elie Gesbert (Arkéa-Samsic)84km to go: Valuable points for Damiano Caruso.At the top of Montée d’Aussois, the Bahrain-Merida rider took five points. He started the day in third place in the KOM standings.86km to go: Pinot is off his bike. It’s over.He was almost 5min behind the leaders, and after an arm round the shoulder from a Groupama teammate, he’s done. A sad, sad end to what had been an excellent campaign for the home hope.89km to go: Pinot is in tears. This is hard to watch. He had a brief spell of trying to fight back, but he’s lost a further 30 secs and it seems hideously unlikely that he’s reaching the finish line today.Meanwhile, Zakarin is off his bike – mechanical problems have necessitated a change. He’s off again and fighting back to Alaphilippe’s group.90km to go: the breakaway quartet has been reeled in. There’s now a sizeable bunch of 25 at the front of the race. The peloton is 47sec back.Bradley Wiggins is tracking Pinot’s disintegration well off the back of the peloton for Eurosport. The problem seems to be with the Frenchman’s knee. He’s now 3:30 behind the leaders.92km to go: Pinot briefly had to stop completely to receive more help. He’s off again, but it looks ominous for the home hope. Don’t forget, he started the stage fifth in GC. Not the biggest of his problems, but his sunglasses look slightly skew-whiff to me as well.93km to go: Pinot’s receiving attention from a medical support car. Looks like a dressing on his left-thigh is being replaced. He tries to ride off, but away, but looks seriously uncomfortable. He’s off again, but seemingly going backwards. Bardet, meanwhile, has fought back to the peloton, and up ahead there’s a 19-strong chase group. Peloton is now at 53sec back.96km to go: Bardet is labouring to keep with the yellow jersey group. The polka-dot holder is a surprise struggler. Alaphilippe’s mob are now down to a group of 40.Two riders have gone down round a hairpin bend – Sergio Henao among them. Both are thankfully up and racing again.100km to go: the leading quartet are on the descent. Now the stage is on. The peloton fragments as some take a well-earned breather while several put the hammer down to make some ground back. Bradley Wiggins reports some sad-looking faces at the back of the peloton, and there are much more severe climbs still to come today.Meanwhile, Richard Simpson isn’t one for tradition …Apart from adding in jumps, I can’t think of anything better than watching the first-placed rider, coasting into Paris drinking a glass of champagne for photographers being horrified as the second placed rider bursts past, gets a jump and wins the tour. I’d buy that man’s T-shirt.102km to go: Riders are gradually feeling the heat at the back of the peloton, and it’s going to be a long day for some. Gap to the front now – with the same quartet still working hard together – is just 21secs. Meanwhile Barguil and Gallopin have broken away to try and bridge the gap as the first summit approaches.104km to go: Another chase group tries to develop. Fabio Aru is prominent. Wellens shows interest too. Nah. Swallowed up again. But the gap to the front is now down to 27secs.106km to go: The peloton reels in the chase group. The gap to the front is closing, now just 33secs, and the gradual climb is curbing ambitions from those wanting to bridge the gap behind. 108km to go: The chase group becomes a quintet, then an octet. Politt and Rosskopf are joined by Perichon, King, Sicard, Gesbert, Quintanilla and Haga. The main players are yet to make a move, and until that changes, it’s great news for Alaphilippe.110km to go: Joey Rosskopf has moved up to give Politt a hand. This chase group is now 25secs off the front, with the peloton a further 16 back.111km to go: Gap is now 39 seconds. Nils Politt is on his own betwixt peloton and breakaway.Mark Ballard asks something that, coincidentally, is an annual argument in the  office that we’ve already had once this morning …Can you help settle a family argument please? If it was close after Saturday is there any way that the Paris stage would be GC raced rather than a procession? I (aged 41.5) think it wouldn’t be due to history and convention but my Dad (aged 71 and some) reckons it could be …Imagine being in charge of selling kit for a team that breaks the tradition. 118km to go: Vincenzo Nibali’s on the move. He’s joined by Dan Martin, Jesus Herrada and Pello Bilbao Lopez de Armentia. It’s a pretty convincing break from this quartet – the gap is 17 seconds and rising.122km to go: Three riders attempt to burst clear, but the break fails to have a decisive air and the peloton – for now – looks largely unconcerned.124km to go: Tim Wellens looks a reluctant breakaway leader, looking round to see who’s around him. He’s happy to give way and it’s a predictably tentative start.On the weather front, much, much, much kinder temperatures for the riders today. It’s looking like a steady 21C in Tignes through to the finish, but – interestingly – raining. Will be fascinating to see if slick roads play a part on the descents.Christian Prudhomme is waving his flag. Stage 19 is now under way. Strap in folks.Alaphilippe looks utterly at ease, chatting with green jersey holder Peter Sagan as the riders prepare for the rollout. A lovely reception from the fans and locals in Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne as the easy 4.8km begins.I don’t want this Tour to end … Not just because it’s been the most beguiling, exciting and wide-open editions in years, but also because to me, the end of Le Tour is the end of the summer, autumn’s chilly dawn being heralded by the start of the football season next weekend.True, La Vuelta is still to come … but that’s a bit like being deserted by your teenage sweetheart, and her trying to get her rather dowdy friend to go out with you instead. It just isn’t the same. The desolation outweighs the attempt at consolation.If anyone with Photoshop skills fancies mocking up a Vuelta preview poster with that as the tagline, absolutely feel free.And indeed, Brailsford is giving nothing away. Speaking to Eurosport, the Team Ineos manager says:We came in here wanting to win it – we still want to win it. There comes a point in time where it’s all or nothing. The person who’s willing to die the most is going to win it. The one who’s turning himself inside-out is Alaphilippe.We want to win. This is coming down to a man-on-man GC battle. There’s six guys fighting it out, and two of those are from the same team. We’ve got to make that count.And so, to the Team Ineos question. Bernal outclimbed and outfought Thomas yesterday, and goes into today with a five-second advantage over the defending champion.So who is the de facto team leader for the remainder of the race? Dave Brailsford told French broadcasters yesterday: “We will discuss this between ourselves – we are going to decide tonight. For me, there is no difference of level between the two. They are two good climbers.”Word is the decision has been made, and I’m sure the team will let the riders show the outcome rather than pre-announcing. Bradley Wiggins, speaking on Eurosport, thinks Thomas should be The Man. It’s going to be fascinating, as the Welshman has had the air of a man clinging on for several days. Is there a huge effort in him, given how lightly he raced in preparation for this year’s Tour? Europop? 90s alt-rock? Dinosaurs? Where’s the live cycling (q: two different emailers)We’re just under half an hour from the start of today’s racing, folks. I love this Tour … it’s brilliant. For the first time in years it feels like it’s about the ‘sport’. There isn’t anyone in the top 10 I would not like to see win.We all want to see a French winner, just for the love of the event, but who would complain if we also see a Colombian or Welsh winner?Despite all the money it’s still the only eventsport which lets the fans in. People want to get dressed up as a polka-dot sperm to run up the hill with the cyclists. I would love to see that in football.Oh my days. Can you imagine polka-dot-clad sperm running up and down the line with the officials at the football? Make it happen Uefa.And you didn’t think I’d missed that surname, did you? Did you really? I’ll be less obvious and give you a version of the original though …Quick reminder of yesterday’s events …Geraint Thomas chased a fierce attack by his Team Ineos teammate Egan Bernal, yet still lost second place overall to the Colombian as the tension in the Tour de France ramped up another notch and the unflappable Julian Alaphilippe again clung on to his overall lead.Bernal, widely tipped for victory before the Tour began, was finally unleashed by Team Ineos in the thin air on the approach to the 2,642-metre summit of the Col du Galibier as his fellow Colombian Nairo Quintana rode clear on his own to a third career stage win in the Tour.“It was Geraint’s decision,” Bernal said of his attack. “He asked me to attack to try to move the race and tried to come with me but when he saw the other guys on his wheel he just stayed with them. But I attacked because he asked me to attack.”Jeremy Whittle’s full report here …Jakob Mathiszig-Lee is first into the inbox today … I have a night shift tonight which is great because it means i have the whole of today to watch what should be an amazing stage. Here on  sport there is occasionally a pleasing wefting of early sport and late shift. It can be a beautiful thing. Sorry, do continue …Think there’s going to be some fireworks from pretty early on today after Alaphilippe showed some uphill weakness yesterday. Head says Bernal is wearing yellow in Paris but would very much like to see Julian hold on to it today so i can see how half of France fits on to roadside of the final climb tomorrow.He’s not that fussed about yellow. Literally gave it away yesterday before giving interviews (beautiful moment, incidentally) …Now I won’t lie to you, the first minute of this video may be a slight slog if hi-NRG Europop isn’t your bag.But from 1:01 … oh mama …And so, the Tour hits the roof. This year’s toppermost peak arrives, the Col de l’Iseran, 2,770m above sea level, for the literal highlight of the first of two remaining mountain stages. Today is beautifully set up, with aspirant GC contenders knowing they’re running out of road this year. They have a very real need to get a wiggle on.A couple of blips aside, Julian Alaphilippe has looked utterly at home in yellow since first donning it after stage 8, and unless yesterday’s struggles over the Galibier left him more sapped than it appeared, one or more of the chasing pack need to pull out something memorable. Alaphilippe’s descending prowess could push them to even bigger efforts on today’s climbs – yesterday’s fightback on the downhill was a soil-yourself piece of riding by the Frenchman, as he rounded parked motorhomes so tightly on hairpin bends that you feared someone had convinced him they’re all holograms. It may take a career-pinnacle up-and-down effort from the likes of Egan Bernal, Geraint Thomas and Thibaut Pinot to go into Saturday with any chance still remaining.Bernal goes into today his closest challenger, as he lies 1min 30 behind the Frenchman, defending champion Thomas is five seconds behind his Ineos teammate in third. Steven Kruijswijk is at 1:47, three seconds ahead of Pinot. Eyes suddenly look beyond Emanuel Buchmann (2:14) in sixth to see if Nairo Quintana can repeat yesterday’s trick with the altitude holding no fears and a deficit that’s suddenly down to 3:54 from a previously-unlikely 9:30. If the Colombian makes a break for it early on, expect mayhem behind. He jumped from 12th to seventh yesterday. First to the top of the Iseran gets the Souvenir Henri-Desgrange, the award handed out for those leading the way over the Tour’s biggest climb each year. Point of order: Quintana won it last year after a superb climb up Col du Portet.Good morning folks. What a day we have in store.Uphill for the first (gulp) 89km, this stage is about one climb, the Col de l’Iséran, the “roof of the Tour” at 2,770m above sea level. It’s rarely used in the race, and still less frequently at the key point in a stage. It will make it hard for a break to stay away, but teams will fire any domestiques with any strength left up the road to support their leaders later – Movistar particularly like this tactic – and the finish will be about who of a very select group has anything left on the short climb to Tignes. Egan Bernal might be the best candidate depending on Ineos’s tactics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13fbac17507d321b2ff1c867df26d439d99cfb5a/0_227_6865_4120/master/6865.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=000ef73471f582e964036aef8054b706","title":"malory towers review emma rice enid blyton passenger shed bristol","story":"The Passenger Shed, BristolWith a erse cast bringing an affectionate subversiveness to Enid Blyton’s postwar school tales, Rice’s musical is huge fun and surprisingly contemporaryEmma Rice’s last show, Wise Children, the first for her theatre company of the same name, was adapted from Angela Carter’s sexy tale of outsiders, illegitimates and cabaret queens. This one, based on Enid Blyton’s boarding-school series, with its jolly japes and dormitory dramas, could not be further removed from that world.But Rice has called the Malory Towers series “radical to its bones”, and if it is not exactly that on stage, it is made rollicking in her enchanting musical production.It combines storylines from the six books, which were written between 1946 and 1951 (though much of it is from First Term… ), and draws out their themes of friendship, bullying and the effects of postwar trauma on children. It mostly keeps the period setting, but is framed by the present day, the pupils appearing briefly in contemporary dress, some holding mobile phones, before we are transported to Blyton’s world.The look, sound and feel of the production give a clear sense of a Rice makeover. Just as in Wise Children, there are strong strains of cabaret, with song, dance, hints of camp and a preoccupation with theatrical artifice. The girls put on a play, and reflect on the nature of creativity and drama. There are occasional back-flips and some harp-playing. The songs are emotional and evocative, even if some are drenched in nostalgia – Mr Sandman, for example, and Sing, Sing, Sing.In casting terms, Blyton’s Malory girls now encompass difference and ersity, with two actors of colour (the excellent Izuka Hoyle as Darrell Rivers and Renée Lamb as Alicia), another who is non-binary (Vinnie Heaven as tomboy Bill Robinson) and one who has dwarfism (Francesca Mills, who plays Sally Hope with bossy brilliance). The cast are all equally magnificent, energetic performers with forceful, flawless voices.At times, Blyton’s overbearing moral messages about kindness and cruelty jar, if only for adults, and sometimes Sally’s lines sound too adult. But a note of wryness enters Rice’s script, particularly in the second part, when some lines are said with faux naivety and others with tongue firmly in cheek, so that an affectionate subversiveness begins to arise.Rice’s rigour and passion are clear to see in her direction and the production as a whole, which is stuffed full of inventions and enchantments. Lez Brotherston’s mezzanine set is clean but complex, the back-screen used in thrilling ways (with a train scene reminiscent of Wise Children’s bus scene), the floorboards lifting up to conjure a swimming pool, a French class morphing in a few nifty moves into a Parisian restaurant with can-can dancers.There’s a sense of total theatre as the actors clamber among the audience and perform during the interval in the foyer, which in itself feels like an extension of the set with its blackboards, hopscotch and fairy lights.Best of all, it is a celebration of girlhood, with Blyton’s postwar focus on the necessity not just to be kind but to be strong women. This, ironically, gives Malory Towers its most contemporary resonance. For grownups, it is a knowing trip back in time. For kids, it is magic.•At the Passenger Shed, Bristol, until 18 August, then touring until 5 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93fae921048e3855b4821dcc7ad0dda393ff534f/121_394_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fea49957f724ee57ed3c82d5573ffc13","title":"roisin conaty funniest things","story":"The actor, standup and creator of TV sitcom GameFace on the things that make her laugh the mostAnything by Key \u0026amp Peele, like the terrorist on the plane sketch.

Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4bcbb402a40f19f4916f38b7f918b2a9e69afd0/0_180_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21b6dc1c919a87aecc31925c12a28367","title":"the boys review sick of superheroes heres the remedy","story":"Bored to death of billowing capes? This black comedy about an anti-superhero unit is a rocket full of Kryptonite – and a welcome respite from Marvel overkillSuperheroes are big business, literally, in Amazon’s fantastical new comedy. The timing seems apt – The Boys touches down just as Avengers: Endgame has nudged past Avatar to become the most successful film of all time. For those who simply cannot get enough of superheroes, it puts a wicked spin on some now very familiar archetypes: the fierce warrior queen, the lickety-split speedster, the flag-draped mega-god walking among us. But if you are sick to the back teeth of billowing capes, The Boys also offers a sly corrective to our current era of blind hero worship by aiming some nasty kicks at their softest parts. It is gleeful, violent and blackly comic, a raucous rocket full of Kryptonite.The Boys takes place in a world where the so-called ‘super-abled’ are both real and omnipresent, dominating culture and commerce in a way that seems inevitable. The brightest and best are the Seven, a shiny supergroup represented by the blandly ominous Vought corporation and directed by calculating powerbroker Madelyn (Elisabeth Shue). These costumed paragons have been commercialised to an extent that even the Marvel merchandising machine might find a little distasteful. Between chat show appearances and energy-drink endorsements, the occasional bit of evil-doing is photogenically foiled, although Vought is also eyeing up some lucrative government defence contracts.At first we see the stage-managed public face of these heroes through the eyes of admirers. Timid electronics store clerk Hughie (Jack Quaid) is one of the little people, happy to gaze up in awe at these larger-than-life champions. Annie AKA strobing crimefighter Starlight (Erin Moriarty) is a hard-working small-town hero whose future suddenly looks bright when she gets an audition to join the Seven. After a brace of upsetting encounters – one that leaves so much blood and viscera on the street that some viewers might decide to click over to the rather more jolly Good Omens – the scales fall from Hughie and Annie’s eyes. Turns out most superheroes have super-flaws and super-vices (as evidenced in an eyebrow-raising sex club scene). But if you pick a fight with Superman, how can you possibly win?Enter Billy Butcher (Karl Urban), a shady CIA-type with a wandering Cockney accent and a fondness for swinging a crowbar. Butcher wants to reactivate his ad-hoc anti-superhero unit the Boys and sees Hughie as the first potential recruit. This cranks up the tension that fizzes through the rest of the eight-part series. It is essentially a tale of asymmetrical warfare as Butcher, Hughie and some other unexpected allies try to outmanoeuvre opponents with colossal strength, X-ray vision and super-hearing. As baseline humans, the Boys have to rely on cunning, inventive cruelty and dumb luck.The Boys shares some DNA with Preacher, another caustic and hyper-violent tale familiar to Amazon Prime viewers in the UK (although unlike The Boys, it is produced by AMC). Both shows are based on comics by Garth Ennis – a writer who enjoys kneecapping authority figures, be they in capes or cassocks – and have been shepherded to the screen by producers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. The Boys has been repositioned for the US market – Hughie was originally Scottish and short, while Quaid is a wiry American six-footer – but as with Preacher, Rogen and Goldberg seem keen to honour the source material, and not just by faithfully reproducing Butcher’s barrage of F-bombs. Darick Robertson, the artist who co-created The Boys, based Hughie’s likeness on Simon Pegg, who gamely appears here as Hughie’s exasperated dad, a presumably fairly expensive in-joke.For those that relish the luridness of Preacher, The Boys is similarly OTT but even scuzzier, operating in an often-nocturnal world of alleys, e bars and basement boltholes. From behind a hefty beard, Urban is louche but menacing as Butcher, especially when eyeballing Homelander (Antony Starr), the golden-haired, shiny-toothed, seemingly perfect Superman surrogate. Amid all the flashy superhero grandstanding and cool anti-hero posturing, it is left to the youngest cast members to play something more relatable. While both have an appealing innocence, it is Moriarty’s maltreated but undaunted Starlight who, appropriately, feels like she is preventing the whole thing from collapsing into darkness.With a second season already confirmed, The Boys is clearly ticking the right boxes for Amazon. They might even allow themselves a supervillain’s manic chuckle that they managed to get their deconstruction of superheroes out into the streaming wild before HBO’s similarly-themed Watchmen sequel series glides into view. But perhaps the best way to approach The Boys is to view it through the prism of another revered comic: Billy Butcher sounds like a Viz character, and the whole series channels the same anarchic, profane energy.Season one of The Boys launches on Amazon Prime Video on 26 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcfc02748f2de9828376d3512e8286f456d6036c/0_229_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c034edaaffc098436e4a0aea46ba2e1b","title":"man 73 and his two dogs survive four days lost in oregons remote high desert","story":"Gregory Randolph was near death when a long-distance mountain biker stumbled upon him, 14 miles from his broken-down car A 73-year-old man who was stranded in the remote Oregon high desert for four days with his two dogs was rescued when a long-distance mountain biker discovered him near death on a dirt road, authorities said Thursday.Gregory Randolph had hiked about 14 miles (22.5km) with one of his dogs after his Jeep got stuck in a narrow, dry creek bed. He was barely conscious when biker Tomas Quinones found him on 18 July.Quinones, of Portland, had not seen anyone all day as he biked across the so-called Oregon outback, a sparsely populated expanse of scrub brush and cattle lands in south-central part of the state. At first, he thought the strange lump was a dead cow.“As I got closer, I thought, ‘that’s a funny looking cow’ and then I realised that this was a man,” he said on Thursday.“I started noticing that he sometimes would look at me but his eyes were all over the place, almost rolling into the back of his head. Once I got a better look at him, I could tell that he was in deep trouble.”Randolph was horribly sunburned, couldn’t talk or sit up, and could barely drink the water Quinones offered him.Quinones had not had a cellphone signal for two days, so he pressed the “SOS” button on a GPS tracking device he travels with in case of emergency.He sat with Randolph, unfurling his tent to provide shade as they waited. A tiny Shih Tzu dog emerged from the brush and Quinones fed it peanut butter.An ambulance showed up more than an hour later and whisked Randolph away, leaving the dog.A sheriff’s deputy showed up minutes later and, after giving a report, Quinones continued his trip. The deputy took the dog.But Quinones soon noticed what appeared to be Randolph’s footsteps in the dust and followed them back for four miles until the foot tracks left the road, he said.When the deputy passed while leaving the area, Quinones pointed out the tracks then continued on.Oregon state police said they used an airplane to spot Randolph’s Jeep two days later, on 20 July. His second dog had stayed at the site and was also alive.The dog may have gotten some water from mud puddles in the creek bed, Lake County Deputy Buck Maganzini said. The Jeep was miles from the nearest paved road, he added.Lake County is nearly 400 miles (644km) southeast of Portland.“It’s still there. It very well could stay there forever. I don’t know how he got the Jeep in as far as he did,” Maganzini said.Randolph spent several nights in a hospital but is now home and recovering, as are his dogs. “He was just out driving the roads that’s kind of common out here,” Maganzini said.“There’s not a heck of a lot else to do. You see a lot of pretty country.”Quinones has finished his back-country bike trip and said he feels lucky that he found Randolph when he did and that he had a way to summon help.He later discovered it would have been a six-hour ride to the next campsite with cellphone service had he not had his GPS tracking “SOS” device.“There’s no way to tell how long he’d been collapsed on that road,” he said. “It’s kind of mind-blowing.”In May a woman was found alive with her husband’s dead body, weeks after the couple got lost in the Californian desert.

Here’s why it could be worth giving it another shot …TV, takeaways and, erm, life insurance – I know which I’d rather commit to tonight when I get home. Admittedly, insurance isn’t exactly the sexiest of weeknight propositions, so it’s hardly any wonder so many of us choose to bury our heads in the proverbial sand when it comes to facing it. But before you fall into a slumber deeper than Snow White on a hangover, let me tell you why it might be worth giving it five minutes of your time (it won’t take any longer than that, promise).You see, life insurance is one of those things that makes perfect sense on paper - the kind of task you wonder why you didn’t get round to sorting once you realise what it actually involves (before swiftly ignoring it again for another six months, if you’re anything like me). I mean, think about it, how many important things have you taken the time to insure in your lifetime? I can name several - a car, the odd holiday, my home and a smartphone (or six). So why is it we’re neglecting to insure the most important thing of all?A quick straw poll of my friends reveals the many reasons we don’t. Some figure that not having children, a partner, or owning a home, means they don’t need it – they reason there’s no point spending money on something they don’t actually need yet. But if either of those things could plausibly happen in the near future, it might be worth planning ahead (after all, you’ll have more pressing things to worry about once any #wedmin kicks in, and doing it sooner likely means lower monthly payments, too). It’s also worth asking whether any dependants or loved ones would be financially stable without you, since life insurance could take care of that (something not many of us like to think about, granted).Life insurance could also be very useful for anybody jointly responsible for mortgage payments. What happens if one person dies before the mortgage is paid (nope, not a fun discussion but an important one)? Experts flag that we shouldn’t assume death-in-service cover or life insurance via your employer means we don’t need to worry about life insurance, either, unfortunately. While useful, workplace cover tends to pay out benefits as a multiple of salary (eg four-years’ salary) to ensure your family has cash available to make up for the loss of your salary to maintain their lifestyle it may not cover any large financial commitments, such as a mortgage.What are the available options? Well, Aviva offers three types of life insurance: cover that remains the same, and so do the payments cover and premiums that increase over time and cover that decreases.For the latter, the value of the cover goes down each month, but your regular payments stay the same. People usually use this product to cover a repayment mortgage, which also decreases.If you’re looking to help cover your salary and maintain loved ones’ living standards or to settle your mortgage and provide reassurance – then you may want to go for the same level, or increasing if you want some protection against the effects of inflation. Still with me? Good.The best part is there’s minimal legwork – most customers could get a quote and decision in just over five minutes (reading this is probably the most arduous part, sorry) and it might be cheaper than you think, with policies starting at around £5 a month. So we could all start protecting our loved ones immediately.Pretty awesome, right? And probably much smarter than putting it off until your next birthday, and spending more when we do bite the bullet (since policies tend to get more expensive the older you are). Making that decision suddenly feels like a no-brainer to me – what about you? Then we can all get back to that boxset and tikka masala …For more information, visit avivalife"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003501bf842d860c771d35a01c2874fb6f4f636a/0_345_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=009d93b11ef3388c8ae786cbbed83c7e","title":"can music unite a young nation","story":"A third of Latvia’s culture budget goes on music education and a new festival aims to galvanise national identity In the UK it is almost obligatory for a culture minister never to have attended an opera. In Latvia, a small country that takes these things very seriously, the newly installed culture minister hasn’t just seen plenty of operas, he’s starred in them.Nauris Puntulis a tenor who also had a successful pop career in his 20s, but is now the craggy, grey-haired minister-from-central-casting in the country’s centre-right coalition government.Latvia is proud of its musical traditions. Like Finland on the other side of the Baltic Sea, it produces a remarkable number of leading conductors and classical musicians for so small a country.This summer it is launching an annual music festival at the capital’s seaside resort, Jūrmala, designed to be more than just a moment of high culture but something of a rallying point for a country with a delicate historical and geo-political backdrop.Latvia and the other Baltic states had spent centuries as playthings of empires – Swedish, Polish, German and Russian. All it had to sustain itself was its language and a Lutheran choral tradition that remains vibrant and culminates every five years in a huge song and dance festival in Riga at which the combined choir numbered 17,000.The Latvian state lasted only 20 years before the country was occupied successively by the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union once again after the second world war. Latvia has only been independent again since 1991. “It was our folk art culture that kept us alive under the Soviet occupation,” says Puntulis.There was, though, one beneficial byproduct of that almost 50-year Soviet occupation – the network of free music schools that have helped a country of just 2 million people to produce a battery of international classical music stars: conductors Mariss Jansons and Andris Nelsons opera singers Elīna Garanča and Kristine Opolais violinists Gidon Kremer and Baiba Skride and cellist Mischa Maisky. Grafting Soviet pedagogy on to Latvia’s choral tradition has produced a potent musical mix.In the UK, music education now relies on parents stumping up for private lessons. But Latvia has a network of 120 music schools, not just in the cities but in the countryside too, and one in 12 children attend them, usually between 3pm and 6pm after their general schooling is over.“The accessibility of the music schools is the pride of our nation,” says Puntulis. “A third of the culture budget goes into education.” Critics argue that it is too expensive and that the system should prioritise excellence over mass participation, but Puntulis is unconvinced. “We’re educating listeners as well as performers.”The new festival hopes to tap into that audience – in Latvia opera and classical concert prices tend to be lower than in the west and audiences younger – as well as attract music lovers from other countries.“The aim is to put Latvia on the map,” says the festival’s director Zane Čulkstēna, who also founded and still runs the contemporary art centre in Riga. “We want to get across the message that music has a special place here, and we are not from forests where we spend all our time picking mushrooms”, although mushrooms are indeed a national obsession in heavily forested Latvia.The festival is largely privately funded by a group of business people based in Latvia or who are part of the large Latvian diaspora that resulted from the tragedies of the 20th century. The chairman of the trustees is Petr Aven, a Russian businessman whose father was half-Latvian. Aven is worth an estimated $5.2bn so he can afford the logistical and financial burden of bringing four internationally renowned symphony orchestras and an array of soloists to Riga and Jūrmala on four weekends in July and August. But in future years, when the festival hopes to add extra weekends, he is looking for greater state support.“We are doing this for Latvia,” he tells me during the interval of the second of the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra’s two concerts at Riga’s opera house. “Latvia is potentially a great country. It lost a lot of people during the second world war and in Soviet times, but it has a great environment and a great musical culture. We wanted to do something to distinguish Latvia from the rest of the world, but at some stage we hope the Latvian state will come in. If you want it to be sustainable, you need the state to participate.”Aven, eager to get back to the second half of the concert, is coy when I ask him why music matters so much to Latvians. “Why do they play football in Brazil? Why in France are there so many painters?” he says.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theBut the new president, Egils Levits, a judge at the European Court of Justice, who attends the festival’s gala opening, is happy to spell out its central role.Culture, he explains, was central to the survival of Latvian identity during the occupation and is just as important now in a digital age that threatens to atomise the population. “The choral movement has a big social role,” he says, “especially in the countryside, with people coming together over a period of years to prepare for the song festival.” The fact that the anti-Soviet movement of 1987-91 that led to the independence of Latvia and the other Baltic states was called the Singing Revolution underlines the social and political importance of the choir tradition.Like many politicians across Europe, Levits is worried about globalisation. He says the decline of solidarity and a shared identity – complicated in Latvia by the presence of both Latvian- and Russian-speaking populations – feeds alienation and social breakdown. Keeping musical and cultural traditions alive, making sure, as Puntulis says, that the concert hall is not entirely supplanted by the shopping mall, is accorded a significance unthinkable in the west. “In America, culture is something for the elite,” says Levits. “In Latvia it’s for everyone.”He realises that an emphasis on protecting the nation’s traditions can become nativist if taken too far, but says he is determined to guard against that. “It is possible to be introverted, to reflect about ourselves, but at the same time to be open to the world,” he insists. The ambition is to strike a balance between modernity and tradition, cutting-edge digital technology and vast choirs in national costume, though the number of audience members using their state-of-the-art mobile phones during concerts at the festival’s opening weekend suggests some misunderstand the nature of that balance.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the British and Irish governments and the North’s five main political parties were “very close” to striking deal to restore Northern Executive and Assembly, after his first meeting with the new Northern Secretary Julian Smith at Stormont on Friday.Mr Coveney, after holding talks with 47-year-old Mr Smith at Stormont House, also said he believed the new Northern Secretary was a “man who can get things done”.In a series of engagements on his first day in Northern Ireland as secretary of state Mr Smith also met Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Ulster Unionist Party and Alliance. The DUP was unable to meet him for “logistical” and diary reasons.The first impressions of Mr Smith from the political parties were reasonably positive. Party sources said he appeared to be “more clued-in” about the political stalemate in Northern Ireland and to have more “spark and energy” than his predecessor Karen Bradley.Mr Coveney after his meeting with Mr Smith paid tribute to Ms Bradley and also spoke of some positive developments in the talks designed to reinstate Stormont, which have been running for three months.“I think we are very close to having the basis for agreement but ultimately the parties have to buy into that,” he said.“What has been put in place in the last 12 to 13 weeks is certainly a foundation that we can build on now, and I think we can do it relatively quickly. But ultimately that will be a call for the leadership of the five parties,” he added.Mr Coveney balanced this optimistic note with the warning that the talks were not an “easy process” and that the polarisation in Northern politics was difficult to resolve.The Minister for Foreign Affairs added, “We are now at a point where all five parties need to agree to accommodate each other on a broad-based deal across multiple areas that can be the basis of an Executive that can last, that can function and can work and withstand the strains and pressures that sometimes are part of politics in Northern Ireland. We are not there yet.”Warm commentsMr Coveney was also warm in his personal comments about Mr Smith, a former British government chief whip who in that capacity had regular dealings with the DUP to ensure that its confidence and supply agreement to keep the Tories in power was maintained.He said, “I think he is a man who can get things done. He has a good reputation. We are the same age, and I think we will get on very well. He is very smart and I think he understands the political parties in Northern Ireland. He obviously understands the DUP very well because he has worked with them in London. But I think he is anxious to reach out to the other political parties too . . . We have got off to a very good and honest start.”The four other parties have expressed concerns that Mr Smith could be a “Yes Man” for the DUP because of Boris Johnson’s dependency on the votes of the ten DUP MPs to keep his government in power.The DUP East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson rejected any suggestions that the reason his leader Arlene Foster did not personally meet him on him in Stormont on Friday because he “already was in the pocket” of the DUP.He said there was no face-to-face meeting on Friday because of “logistical” reasons. Mr Robinson insisted that Mr Smith would be an honest broker in the negotiations.Mr Smith spent about an hour – the longest meeting of the day — with Sinn Féin leaders Mary Lou McDonald, Michelle O’Neill and Conor Murphy. Ms McDonald said she pressed for a border poll on a united Ireland and told him she hoped he would be the last Northern Secretary in Northern Ireland — a comment that he took with “good part”, she added.She also gave him a copy of the Belfast Agreement which he had read and would reread. Ms McDonald was reasonably benign in her initial assessment of Mr Smith. “In a spirit of fairness you have to give a person a fair wind to read themselves into their brief, to get a handle on the issues,” she said.SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon encouraged Mr Smith, along with the Irish Government, to publish a “best guess” paper on what would constitute a deal to restore Stormont, if the DUP and Sinn Féin could not reach agreement.Ulster Unionist Party Assembly member Doug Beattie said “grip and grin” introductory session with Mr Smith was useful. “We made it absolutely clear to him that, no matter what his relationship is with the DUP, he cannot be a sop to their tantrums. He cannot be meek and mild in front of Sinn Féin intransigence, he has to bang their heads together,” he said.Alliance leader Naomi Long said she warned Mr Smith against a no-deal Brexit.“As somebody who fought for the withdrawal agreement and backstop, he could have a role in influencing government policy and that’s I suppose the most that we can hope for, in the current circumstances,” she said.Full results and coverage of the fallout of the Stormont Assembly election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3968240.1564132933!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"air passengers face delays after record temperatures in uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA busy Euston train station in London as morning train commuters face disruption after the extreme heat caused chaos on the rail network. Photograph:   Georgina StubbsPA WireRail and air passengers are being urged to avoid unnecessary travel in the UK as efforts continue to repair damage to the rail network caused by record-breaking July temperatures.There are also delays and cancellations at Heathrow, the UK’s biggest airport because of “extreme weather conditions across Europe”.UK Network Rail is urging commuters planning to use the Midland Main Line between St Pancras and Sheffield to check before travelling due to reduced service levels.Meanwhile, Great Northern, Thameslink, East Midland Trains and West Midlands Trains warned of fewer carriages on some services, cancellations and continuing disruption.Network Rail said in a statement: “Trains had to run at reduced speeds, which also meant a reduced service ran and those which did run were extremely busy.”Train speeds are being reduced to cut the likelihood of steel tracks buckling after multiple incidents on the network, including problems with overhead equipment on the line between Kentish Town and West Hampstead and a fire near the railway in West Hampstead.The weather is also causing difficulties to flights. British Airways announced that “severe thunderstorms are causing significant delays and cancellations to our operation in and out of London”.DisruptionHeathrow Airport asked travellers to “please check with your airline before travelling”, adding that: “We’re sorry for the disruption \u0026amp are working with our airline partners to keep passengers travelling.”Thousands of passengers were left stranded at major stations on Thursday, the hottest July day on record, as temperatures of up to 38.1 degrees created havoc.One passenger posted a video on board a stationary London North Eastern Railway (LNER) service showing sweat-soaked commuters, including a man with a baby, desperately fanning themselves.Another image showed a collapsed man being treated by medical staff outside the train.Thunderstorms in the south-east of England were continuing to bring heavy rain, gusty winds and lightning on Friday morning.“The thunderstorms could continue on and off through the course of the day,” Met Office meteorologist Greg Dewhurst told PA.“There is enough energy in the atmosphere to keep it going.”Temperatures will range from the mid-20s to the low 30s on Friday, Mr Dewhurst added.There were also record-high temperatures recorded in Europe, including Paris which hit more than 40 degrees.Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands all reported unprecedented heat levels, in some cases only one day after previous records were broken. Scientists linked the heatwave to global warming caused by fossil fuel emissions.The thermometer reached 42.6 degrees in Paris, breaking the previous record of 40.4 degrees set in July 1947.

Its kit can be found in just about every Airbus jet, for example.\u0026nbspFootasylum could run a lot faster under JD’s wing after £90m takeoverCobham hit by US defence spending cutsAdvent’s offer represents a 34 per cent premium over Wednesday’s closing share price, and it looks like a shoo-in to get the 75 per cent support from shareholders that\u0026nbspit requires for the deal to go through.The premium looks like a tasty one, and the majority of its investors will likely sign up in a heartbeat.\u0026nbspFor a start, the board has backed it unanimously, as has Artemis, one of\u0026nbspits bigger institutional shareholders. While the company has found its feet of late, its recent history has not been entirely happy. It issued a string of profit warnings between 2015 and 2017. In the last of those years it tapped shareholders for an emergency £500m to help with a debt-mountain built up in part through a botched acquisition.\u0026nbspThe new shares, issued through the cash call, were priced at 75p. Investors who signed up and held on to them are getting 165p in cash from Advent. Cha-ching.\u0026nbspCould Cobham have got there on its own, though? The shares were at a higher level than that as recently as the beginning of 2016. It might seem like a tall order given Britain’s desperate political climate, but the question is rarely asked even when things are going well. The rule in the City is you take the money and run when it’s offered. \u0026nbspAnother rarely raised question, unless the company involved is a big household name, is whether the deal is a good one for this country.\u0026nbspIn the case of Cobham, the government may not even need to lie about this being an investment in Britain that shows off its vim.\u0026nbspAdvent has surely been assisted by the climate that government has created. Its behaviour has so tarnished Sterling that shares denominated in the UK’s currency are unnaturally cheap for overseas bidders, which can therefore afford to make their offers look generous.\u0026nbspWith the requirement to act like a good little vassal of the US, any muted objections to the deal will fall on deaf ears. There’ll be no question of using the slightly beefed up powers the government has to halt takeovers involving sensitive companies like this one.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018The maker of electric cars also said it began preparations for the production of its Model Y, an all-electric SUV.When the model was unveiled in March, Mr Musk promised that it will ride “like a sports car” and will be “the safest mid-size SUV in the world by far”.The Model Y may become Tesla’s most important money spinner, given how popular SUVs have become in the US, Europe and Canada. Most SUVs still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.The pressure on Tesla to become sustainably profitable is intense. Repeated large losses since its inception\u0026nbspand capital raising have\u0026nbspleft the company with a\u0026nbsphuge debt pile: it stood at $11.4bn at the end of the second quarter.Whether Tesla will move into the black this year is in doubt –\u0026nbspmany analysts think it will struggle to meet its 2019 deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.The US has reduced its tax incentive for electric car purchases and will phase it out entirely at the end of the year.But Tesla faces an even deeper problem, as Clement Thibault, an analyst at Investing, pointed out. “Does it matter how many cars you sell, if you can’t make a profit on them?”Tesla’s shares have lost more than 20 per cent of their value this year, while the Standard \u0026amp Poor’s 500 index has surged by as much.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The overall decline marks the longest period of falling sales since 2011.“Despite the recent pick-up we’ve seen in households’ real earnings, the sun is clearly not shining on the British high street,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, which represents British businesses.Strong growth in grocers’ sales was outweighed by steep falls at department stores, clothing retailers and other shops.Another measure, which strips out seasonal variations in sales, also pointed to weakness: a balance of -20 per cent of retailers said sales were good for the time of year.\u0026nbspCompared with recent lows, firms expect\u0026nbspa slight pick-up in their fortunes in August, predicting sales will be broadly flat on a year ago.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson waves as he enters 10 Downing Street following his appointment as Prime Minster by the Queen.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Some fans have been waiting up for six\u0026nbsphours to hear the new album.Other have been speculating that Kanye West’s involvement in the album could have led to its delay, given his reputation as a perfectionist.Chance the Rapper has been teasing the release of his new material on Twitter for weeks, writing “the day is on its way” and announcing a Spotify launch party which took place on Thursday night.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In May, she sent an expletive-ridden tweet after her ABC show Fresh off the Boat was renewed. She later explained her outburst, saying she was “upset” because the show’s renewal meant she had to “give up another project I was really passionate about”.Hustlers will be released in UK cinemas on 13 September 2019.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A phone known as D42 will replace the iPhone XS, one known as D43 will replace the iPhone XS Max, and one called N104 will come in the place of the iPhone XR.Last year was the first time Apple released its iPhones in this line-up, with a large and small version of the premium model and then a cheaper medium-sized version. That same set-up looks set to be in place this year, according to the leak.Perhaps the most notable feature of the new phone is what won\u0027t change. The new phones are said to feature a Lightning port like the existing phones, rather than swapping to the USB-C that arrived on the iPad Pro last year and has long been rumoured to be coming to kill off the Lightning port as a charger.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

That will be a large block of lenses that will feature three cameras arranged into a square shape.iPhone users urged to update old devices to latest iOS softwareThe third lens – a first for the iPhone – will include a new lens that will be able to take wide-angle photos, the report suggested. As well as letting people take wider photos, that will allow for a new feature called Smart Frame which will capture data outside of a traditional photo so that users can change the framing of it by using that same data.The front-facing camera will also receive an upgrade.They will also kill off one major feature, known as 3D Touch, which allowed people to press their phone screen harder and get new menu options. That was introduced on the iPhone 6s but never came to the iPads or the iPhone XR, and the new phones will also drop it – making way for similar tools that will be enabled by software, the report claimed.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier. James Mason plays the alcoholic actor whose career is on the wane, while Judy Garland is the supremely talented up-and-coming singer he meets in a nightclub. Although there were two other major screen versions of the story – one in 1937, the other in 1976 starring Barbara Streisand and Kris Kristofferson – Garland boasts the strongest singing voice of any, and her chemistry with Mason is superb.In this futuristic romance, Joaquin Phoenix plays a man who falls in love with an artificially intelligent computer system, voiced by Scarlett Johannsson. Her – written and directed by Spike Jonze – treats Phoenix\u0027s courtship with all the sensitivity of a flesh-and-blood romance, and what could be a cringe-worthy or facetious premise instead blossoms into a touchingly sincere examination of love in the age of technology.This romcom from 1999 brings Hugh Grant’s down-to-earth bookshop owner into the orbit of an A-list actress played by Julia Roberts, and the unlikeliest of British love affairs ensues. Scripted by Richard Curtis, who had already proved himself a dab hand in the genre with Four Weddings and a Funeral, the film manages to stay charming and keep its tone light, even as its romantic plotline descends into schmaltz.True Romance has an all-star cast that includes Gary Oldman, Dennis Hopper, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini, but eyes are mostly kept on the whirlwind romance struck up between Clarence and Alabama (played by Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette), who go on the run with a suitcase full of cocaine belonging to a notorious gangster. Quentin Tarantino’s script wades through some heavy subject matter, and includes plenty of his characteristic violence, underscored by an effective score from Hans Zimmer.620 Harold and Maude (1971)Age-gap relationships are common in cinema, but seldom like in Harold and Maude. Harold (Bud Cort) is an 18-year-old with an overbearing mother who spends his free time staging elaborate fake suicides. After meeting Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman trying to grab life by the horns, he falls in love. Hal Ashby’s off-beat cult classic doesn’t shy away from the social taboos of their relationship, but make no mistake, Harold and Maude is an earnest and deeply moving romance at its core.720 Beauty and the Beast (1991)The classic French fairy-tale – about the love between a beautiful woman and a prince cursed to live as a beast – has been adapted countless times, most recently into a live-action blockbuster starring Emma Watson. Disney’s 1991 animated musical, however, is the superior on-screen rendering of the romance. Although elements of the story now seem problematic – most glaringly the idea of the Beast imprisoning Belle, and she loving him despite this – there\u0027s still a lot of appeal in the songs, and the hand-drawn animation is fluid and endearing.Positioning three of Old Hollywood’s most beloved stars at the corners of a love triangle, The Philadelphia Story is one of the most enduring romcoms of all time. Navigating its way around the strict Production Code rules regarding extra-marital affairs, George Cukor’s film tells the story of a orced couple (Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant) who are drawn back together despite the allure of a third party (Jimmy Stewart). All three actors play to their strengths: Grant is suave and sardonic, Stewart wide-eyed and self-effacing, while Hepburn is given a strong role in the woman who must choose between her capable suitors.In Carol, Cate Blanchett plays Carol Aird, a woman in the midst of a difficult orce who falls in love with a young photographer, Therese, played by Rooney Mara. The film – a sexy and stylish period piece directed by Todd Haynes – won a host of Oscar nominations, and stands as one of the most specific and deftly crafted representations of female desire in mainstream cinema, earning a particularly devoted fanbase in the LGBTQ community.The highest-grossing French-language film of all time in the US, Amélie is a modern-day fairy-tale about a socially maladjusted young woman who decides to dedicate her life to impishly and secretly helping others. The film leans into the tweeness of its premise, as well as the romance of its Parisian setting, to build a gradual love story that’s straight from the heart. It’s not all sweetness, however, and some of the more world-weary touches – such as Amélie’s lover working in a sex shop – help give the film some sharp edges, and a comic bite.Ang Lee’s Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger as two sheep herders who go through a turbulent but passionate romance. The film’s open and unapologetic depiction of sex and queer relationships made it a landmark release for LGBT representation in mainstream cinema.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good film, It Happened One Night mixes screwball comedy with heartfelt romance. Claudette Colbert plays a wealthy socialite who decides to slum it with an abrasive but charismatic news reporter, played by Clark Gable. One of only three films to ever win all five major Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), It Happened One Night endures as the gold standard for a classical Hollywood romcom.1320 Call Me by Your Name (2017)Set in an Edenic villa “somewhere in Northern Italy”, Call Me by Your Name tells the story of Elio (Timothée Chalamet), a smart but directionless 17-year-old who falls in love with his father’s research assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer). Luca Guadagnino’s languid romance is well on its way to being considered a modern queer classic and it made an instant star out of Chalamet when it hit cinemas in 2017.Richard Linklater’s minimalist romance pairs Ethan Hawke with Julie Delpy as two love-struck strangers who meet on a train and spend the evening together wandering around Vienna. The naturally romantic city is the perfect background for a soft and thoughtful meditation on love, fate and missed opportunities. Hawke and Delpy reportedly crafted much of the naturalistic dialogue through improvisation sessions, for which they were uncredited. They would, however, be credited in the film’s two sequels – Before Sunset (2004) and Before Midnight (2013).2016 Best Picture winner Moonlight is a radical film: a queer romance with an all-black cast that captures a boy’s coming-of-age with heart-wrenching specificity. Chiron, the protagonist, is played by three actors across three chapters of his life – and the third act, in which an adult Chiron (Trevante Rhodes) reconnects with an old flame, is one of the most heart-rending in modern cinema. Writer-director Barry Jenkins showed himself to have a poet’s ear for dialogue and James Laxton’s camerawork perfectly captures the vibrancy and the physicality of romantic attraction.1620 In the Mood for Love (2000)One of the most acclaimed pieces of Asian cinema of all time, In the Mood for Love is a masterful study in love behind closed doors, tracking the emotional affair between two people who realise their spouses are having an affair together. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are exceptional in the lead roles as two soulmates struggling to contain their desire. In 2016, the film was voted the second-best film of the 21st century in a BBC critics poll.David Lean’s tender depiction of an unconsummated extra-marital affair remains one of the finest love stories ever told, and frequently ranks among the best British films ever made. Adapted from Noel Coward’s one-act play Still Life, Brief Encounter focuses on the relationship between Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) and Dr Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard). Their courtship is bookended by two fateful scenes at a train station – once meeting, once parting. It’s hard to estimate how many hundreds of on-screen romances have ended with a teary-eyed lover being carried away on a train, but none have done so as memorably as Brief Encounter.When Harry Met Sally took Annie Hall’s subversion of the romcom genre and removed the neuroses and pseudo-intellectualism. The result was a breezy, observational romantic comedy starring Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as two unlikely lovers. Screenwriter Nora Ephron based much of the film on its eventual director, Rob Reiner. When Harry Met Sally would become a massive hit, spawning an iconic catchphrase (“I’ll have what she’s having”) and even a stage adaptation in 2004.Jack Lemmon plays bedraggled corporate yes-man CC Baxter, who falls in love with elevator operator Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), who is also his boss’s mistress. The 1960 masterpiece, directed by Billy Wilder, is equal parts cynical and romantic, and features one of the most compelling will-they-won\u0027t-theys in the history of cinema.The romance of Casablanca has resonated throughout the 20th century. Its dialogue is among the most-quoted in film history and its locations – the piano bar the airfield – are indelible pieces of Hollywood iconography. Humphrey Bogart is the perfect romantic lead as Rick Blaine, the bitter, lovelorn club owner in French-occupied Morocco whose ex-lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrives with her new flame Victor Laszlow (Paul Henreid), who is wanted by the Nazis. Casablanca has been mimicked and parodied so many times throughout the years that it’s easy to forget quite how inventive it is in its depiction of a love affair torn apart by the brutality of the outside world.Phantom Thread has all the trappings of a conventional period romance. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Reynolds Woodcock, a famous dressmaker who falls in love with Alma (Vicky Krieps), a waitress who later becomes his muse. Paul Thomas Anderson’s twisted romance flies off in some psychologically dark and unexpected directions, but the arc is that of a storybook love affair, of two people taking extraordinary measures to hold onto the one they love.Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga scored big at the box office with last year’s A Star is Born remake, but for many, the definitive version was released nearly 65 years earlier.

There is also a clear political vibe, with commentary on Brexit, the NHS, mental health and how we communicate with each other all strong themes on many of the shortlisted entries.\u0026nbspThe shortlist follows a shake-up of the judging panel, which added Stormzy, Gaz Coombes, Annie Mac and Jorja Smith, and critic and Vice editor Tshepo Mokoena to the group of experts who will decide the winner at a ceremony later this year.See the full shortlist for this year’s Mercury Prize:Idles – Joy As An Act of Resistance\u0026nbspThe 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsFoals have been shortlisted for the third time, having previously appeared on 2013’s list with Holy Fire (losing out to James Blake – Overgrown) and 2010 with Total Life Forever, when the prize was won by The xx for their self-titled debut.\u0026nbspReviewing part one of Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost (the second half is being released this autumn), Mark Beaumont gave the album five stars and wrote: “It’s a dystopian vision becoming all the more real with every February heatwave, and Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1 is a fitting vehicle.\u0026nbsp“Merging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 443 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.543 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1343 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1443 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1743 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2143 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2743 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2943 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3143 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3643 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail.

Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4343 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. There’s a strong showing for both UK rap and also an apparent surge in guitar music, with the majority of shortlisted acts making prominent use of the instrument, including Little Simz on her album GREY Area.\u0026nbspSimz and Dave’s albums were also awarded five stars apiece from The Independent. Of Psychodrama, The Independent commented: “A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity.\u0026nbsp“On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album.”This year’s “token jazz album”, as it has become known, is the 10-piece SEED Ensemble’s Driftglass, which combines South African jazz with Sixties soul and hip hop influences. The project is helmed by composer Cassie Kinoshi, who also plays alto sax in the jazz septet Nérija and in Afrobeat band Kokoroko. Driftglass’s title is taken from writer Samuel R Delany’s image of glass fragments washed by tides, which Kinoshi adopted for the album as a metaphor for how the tides of improvisation form compositions.Notable omissions include James Blake\u0027s Assume Form\u0026nbspalong with albums by Florence + the Machine, AJ Tracey, Lucy Rose and previous winner Skepta. As per previous years, metal is ignored by the prize and so critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums by artists including Bring Me the Horizon, Black Peaks, Architects and Employed to Serve have been left off this year\u0027s list.\u0026nbspFoals interview: ‘Brexit feels like an act of self-harm’Little Simz interview: ‘If you get offended by me, that’s on you’Dave jokes he can ‘retire now’ following Thiago Silva shout-outGeoff Taylor, Chief Executive of BPI - home to the Hyundai Mercury Prize, said: “These 12 albums are essential listening!

That is more than double the 18.9 per cent currently charged on overdrafts with its standard current account and in line with some of the most expensive credit cards available.Nationwide will also no longer allow customers with its FlexPlus account a £250 overdraft without charges.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has banned daily fees on overdrafts, requiring lenders to charge through an annual interest rate instead by April 2020, following years of complaints by consumer groups that customers were being charged excessive fees.Although an interest rate is clearer than the confusing array of daily charges that banks levy and it can be compared with other types of borrowing, it is not necessarily cheaper, as Nationwide’s move demonstrates.Created with Sketch.Deutsche Bank: Sacked staff clear out their belongings Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a Sainsbury\u0027s bagA man leaves the Deutsche Bank offices in London with his belongings in a cardboard boxA woman leaves the US offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankStaff members receive multiple boxes of pizza at the London offices of Deutsche BankMembers of the press wait outside Deutsche bank as firings beginStaff members look down on members of the press as they swarm outside the offices of Deutsche Bank in LondonIn May, when the FCA announced what it described as the “biggest shake-up to the overdraft market for a generation”, it anticipated that lenders would attempt to recoup any loss of revenues by increasing interest rates among other changes.The regulator warned that the new rules could create “winners and losers” as banks change their overdraft charges to comply.The new rules also include a ban on charging different rates for authorised and unauthorised overdrafts, intended to stop lenders saddling a small number of borrowers with large fees, which can in some cases be over 10 times higher than the cost of a payday loan.Other major high street lenders have yet to announce how they will respond.Overdraft fees slashed in radical shake-up of ‘dysfunctional’ marketOne-third of Nationwide’s customers who use their overdraft will see no change or a reduction in fees and interest because interest payable on small overdrafts will be less than the daily charges currently charges. Of the remaining two-thirds, Nationwide said, most will see a rise of 20p per day or less.Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert, said overdraft charges from many providers had been “hideous” for some time.“All overdraft providers will have to charge via APR, so comparisons will now be easier.\u0026nbsp“For existing Nationwide customers though, there are winners and losers. Those with smaller overdrafts who are currently being charged will gain, as the cost is directly in proportion to the amount they’re overdrawn.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And it gives a hint at what that future could look like: 5G iPhones that use Apple\u0027s own chips, which could arrive in the coming years.Apple has been long rumoured to be working on its first 5G iPhone for 2020, putting it long behind competitors like Samsung. That is still expected to arrive next year, but the first of them will likely rely on modem chips made by Qualcomm.But, after that, Apple is expected to use the people and patents it acquired through the Intel acquisition to create new kinds of modems for its own iPhones, in line with what has become a central commitment for the company.Under the deal, about 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Combined with its existing portfolio, Apple will have 17,000 wireless technology patents, ranging from cellular communication standards to modems, making it a more powerful player in global licensing talks that will likely take place between major 5G patent holders such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.New iPhone line-up said to be revealed in huge new leakModem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm Inc over Qualcomm patent licensing practices.Cupertino, California-based Apple reached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.Apple\u0027s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.The deal with Intel will bolster Apple\u0027s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple\u0027s biggest global rivals - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei - already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple\u0027s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker has never formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signaling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate, what analysts have called the Cook Doctrine.We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make, Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.The purchase of Intel\u0027s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm\u0027s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have an internally developed 5G modem technology ready for use in some of its products by 2021. Intel previously disclosed plans to have a 5G modem ready by 2020, so tapping the Intel assets could help Apple hit its target.But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where Apple sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm\u0027s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on Qualcomm for some modems during a transition period to its own devices.There\u0027s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have Independence, but they also realize it has to be done responsibly, this person said.Apple\u0027s license deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm\u0027s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.Apple has engaged with Taiwan\u0027s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.Clearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm, this person said.Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm\u0027s licensing ision in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.I don\u0027t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal, he said. It\u0027ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-license deals.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Another flame flew out of the top of the rocket, as can be seen on the video.The rocket itself appeared to survive without problems, but it is just the latest in a run of issues. It came a week after the Starhopper craft flew a fireball out of its bottom during another test.It was the first time that SpaceX has allowed one of the tests to be streamed. Previous attempts have happened in private – with spectacular descriptions of the launches leaking out after.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - June 2019 Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A coronal mass ejection as seen by the Chandra Observatory.

Company results usually come out at 7am, but by 8am on Friday, when the stock market opened, the results were still missing, all planned calls with the media and analysts were cancelled and a presentation to investors at the retailer’s London head office was scrapped.A spokesman for Sports Direct said: “Unfortunately we are still finalising preliminary results. We anticipate that our annual results will still be released today, with a presentation to follow.”The company’s shares were down almost 5 per cent by 8.30am but later recovered. They dipped again after Sports Direct said at midday that it was still finalising the report and that another update would follow at 2pm.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

In December, Sports Direct said the department store made a loss of £31.6m since it was acquired in August.When the company announced the first delay, it cited the complexities of integrating House of Fraser and uncertainty about the business’s future performance as part of the reason.“It not only raises questions about the haphazard way in which the investor relations and finance teams are run, but also could suggest a material problem with the numbers.”Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a production preview of the Jaguar I-PACE, which will be revealed next year and on the road in 2018The maker of electric cars also said it began preparations for the production of its Model Y, an all-electric SUV.When the model was unveiled in March, Mr Musk promised that it will ride “like a sports car” and will be “the safest mid-size SUV in the world by far”.The Model Y may become Tesla’s most important money spinner, given how popular SUVs have become in the US, Europe and Canada. Most SUVs still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.The pressure on Tesla to become sustainably profitable is intense. Repeated large losses since its inception\u0026nbspand capital raising have\u0026nbspleft the company with a\u0026nbsphuge debt pile: it stood at $11.4bn at the end of the second quarter.Whether Tesla will move into the black this year is in doubt –\u0026nbspmany analysts think it will struggle to meet its 2019 deliveries target of 360,000 to 400,000 vehicles.The US has reduced its tax incentive for electric car purchases and will phase it out entirely at the end of the year.But Tesla faces an even deeper problem, as Clement Thibault, an analyst at Investing, pointed out. “Does it matter how many cars you sell, if you can’t make a profit on them?”Tesla’s shares have lost more than 20 per cent of their value this year, while the Standard \u0026amp Poor’s 500 index has surged by as much.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist. That’s what the people at the Stonewall Inn did that fateful night in 1969. They resisted arrest and the status quo because they knew that their right to love and exist was equal to their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts.’‘Growing up I just did not see myself reflected within the history books. But when I found out that it was Marsh P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, two transgender women of colour, who kicked off the Stonewall riots which lead to the gay rights movement... If filled me with pride.’‘I think perhaps the most glorious fact of the Stonewall riots is that it was the queens, the camp, glitzy queens who saw off the police that night in Greenwich Village. Years of mockery in the streets, being jostled, spat at, arrested and pushed off the sidewalk had toughened them up.’‘Trans women of colour have always stood at the forefront of this movement. Some try to erase the legacies but it’s still apparent in today’s climate that trans women are as bold as ever.’‘I am eternally grateful to those who fought for the recognition of gay identity at a time when society saw it only in crude sexual terms. Stonewall was about the freedom to love without fear.’850 Ruth Hunt, CEO of Stonewall‘We named ourselves after this historic moment and we continue to honour those involved by naming the meeting rooms in our London office after some of the leaders, including a lesbian woman of colour called Storme DeLarverie and two trans women of colour, Sylvia Rivera and Marsha P Johnson.’950 Rikki Beadle-Blair, creator and performer‘I put my heart and soul into the script for Stonewall. And they’re all there: the butches, the fems, the blacks and hiics and whites. The middle-class activists. The street queens. The homeless queer kids. And they are still here, with us in every battle we still have to fight.’‘It laid the foundation for all the campaigns for LGBT+ equality that followed: against Section 28, for an equal age of consent, for equal access to services, for equal marriage, for justice around the world in the face of hostility and violence and bigotry.’‘The Stonewall riots were the spark that galvanised the LGBT+ community to organise in support for our rights. From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made.’3150 Jide Macaulay, pastor and activist‘As a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.’Pride in LondonYouTube‘Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?’‘Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generations.’‘Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us.’Sink the Pink‘Small towns now celebrate their LGBT citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.’‘What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.’4650 Andrew Lumsden, journalist and activist‘The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I\u0027m glad we did.’‘The stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history, but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced.’‘However we should remember that there are so many stories of queer join, pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them.’‘While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’‘When I heard about Stonewall, I remember feeling just like the famous line in the movie Network – I’m mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more. Standing up for our community and advocating for ourselves was powerful then and it is powerful now.’‘I think what we can learn from the uprising is everything we’ve learned after it: until the most marginalised among us are free, none of us are free.’‘Resist.

From homosexuality being a criminal offence, to a law requiring a person to be wearing at least three items of “gender appropriate” clothing, 1969 was a dangerous time to be queer.’1250 Shon Faye, writer and comedian‘While important, I wish 28 June 1969 wasn’t held up as the single moment where LGBT+ history starts, particularly in Britain, where LGBT+ people’s political emergence has its own fascinating history.’‘Since Stonewall, the LGBT+ movement has gone global liberating hundreds of millions of people though hundreds of millions more live in the 68 countries that still outlaw same-sex relations. The Stonewall revolution is not yet over.’1450 Tamal Ray, baker and doctor‘Would I have had the bravery and the fury, to do what did they did that night? Maybe. Maybe not. But I’m here today. And having grown up under the bullshit of section 28 I’m so aware of how lucky I am to have the rights and protections I do.’‘In the midst of a growing homophobic and transphobic backlash against victories won by LGBT+ people, we need to re-invigorate a radical queer movement with demands ranging from reforming the Gender Recognition Act to reversing cuts to LGBT+ services, to properly funding mental health.’‘Those rights and that acceptance, which have been hard-won over the last 50 years, are still fragile. LGBT+ people are still subject to hate crimes. Bosses can still be unsure over points of employment law.  Prejudice persists. The fight continues.’1750 Shahmir Sanni, whistleblower and digital strategist‘In the UK, Stonewall collaborating with UKBlackPride and LGBT+ activists reaching out to marginalised communities with a significant focus on BAME sexual health is a giant leap forward for all of us.’1850 Travis Alabanza, performer and activist‘It reminds us that our change and progress will never be made in just books, or just on our screens, or just in theory - but always in practice, on the streets, together.’‘The stories of Marsha P Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and others have been carried though time by some of our most marginalised communities, beautifully and with all the reverence they deserve.’2050 Michael Cashman, politician, actor and co-founder of Stonewall‘For me it signifies the moment of fighting back when the straw finally breaks the camel‘s back. That happened here in the United Kingdom when the Thatcher government introduced Section 28 in the middle of the Aids and HIV crisis being faced by the gay community.’‘It is a legacy of solidarity across ersity and difference. It is a legacy of how a single act and a moment can have ripple effects for generations to come.’‘I was born in the year of the Stonewall riots and through my lifetime so much has changed. Its a time to thank and celebrate the working-class queer people of colour, the heroic trans people, the drag queens, the fem guys, the butch dykes who fought for their rights to be who they are.’‘Until we have queer history taught properly within our schools, and until media organisations report on our lives with care, I hope that we can come together as a community and share our knowledge, so that our heroes are never forgotten.’‘Trans people, especially trans women of colour, need you to fight for them they way they fought for your rights 50 years ago.’2550 Lea DeLaria, actor and comedian‘That riot, what I saw, my people fighting back, is the reason I have always been out and proud.’‘Now, more than ever, we must stand firm as the tide of tolerance turns against us in many places, in an effort to undo the hard-won victories of the last few decades.’‘We need that spirit of solidarity now more than ever, especially for trans people and queer people of colour - especially seeing what’s happening in places like Chechnya and Brunei.’2850 Phillip Picardi , journalist and editor-in-chief of OUT magazine‘This year, celebration may be a part of Pride – but what we really need is the rebirth of a movement, led by the very folks who have consistently been left behind.’‘On that date in New York, lesbians, gay men, trans people (although they wouldn’t have used that term) and all manner of queer people came together as a unified community and said no to state-sanctioned police brutality.’‘A global rise in extremism and nationalism makes our hard-fought victories vulnerable to attacks and setbacks. It serves to push back even harder and negate the strides we have already made.’3150 Jide Macaulay, pastor and activist‘As a black African British gay Christian living with HIV, it’s a reminder of the continuous fight for inclusion, liberation and ersity, to be respected for who I am and who I love.’Pride in LondonYouTube‘Will those corporations be aligned with us once the parade inevitably turns back to a protest?’‘Stonewall was the founding legend that we all learn from and we must stand tall as one community and one voice so we can pave the way for the new generations.’‘Trump and other emerging nationalists worldwide tend to hold a dim view of gay people. So we must our fight back and fight less amongst ourselves on more minor issues.’‘News that there is to be a straight pride parade made me feel like rioting like it’s June 28 1969 all over again. But straight people don’t need Pride because they weren’t born into a culture that shames their very existence.’‘As a bisexual black woman, I owe many of the freedoms I enjoy today to those who stood up to injustice during the Stonewall riots in 1969.’3750 Jake Graf, actor and writer‘When I transitioned I wanted to understand more about our specific transgender history and felt great pride upon learning that the Stonewall riots happened as a result of courageous and outspoken trans women, mostly of colour.’3850 Lisa Power, co-founder of Stonewall‘We named Stonewall here in the UK so that, no matter how “respectable” we became, we never forgot that we started with a riot.’3950 Matthew Todd, author and journalist‘When a lesbian, we think Stormé DeLarverie, a woman of colour, was being arrested, she yelled to the crowd, “Why don’t you guys do something?” Her brothers and sisters – white, black, gay, bi, lesbian, trans, butch, femme – did do something and came to her aid. That’s incredibly inspiring to me.’‘The pervasiveness of the glossy rainbow flag during Pride can lull us into a sense of inaction. But as we\u0027ve seen over the past month of protests, attacks and media, violence and violations against gay and trans people has not gone away.’4150 Joseph Galliano, CEO and co-founder of the Queer Britain Museum‘Who threw the first punch is not the most important question, it’s what activists did with that pent up anger and frustration, over the long haul that made all the difference to so many lives.’‘It\u0027s important to remember the black and brown trans and queer people who led the riots on those six nights, and how our community is still fighting many of those same battles.’4350 Glynn Fussel, performer and creator‘I\u0027m more concerned about my brothers and sisters in other countries who don\u0027t have the rights that we have. Every single day we should remember the fights that came before us.’Sink the Pink‘Small towns now celebrate their LGBT citizens and the police are no longer hostile. That is progress of which we should all be proud.’‘What matters most to me about Stonewall was that it was one protest of many, one moment in time across decades of rebellion, building community, making our mark.’4650 Andrew Lumsden, journalist and activist‘The uprising brought us the word “gay”. When it crossed the Atlantic to us in 1970 as the Gay Liberation Front, which I promptly joined, none of us had ever before used the word in the sense of sexual orientation. And I\u0027m glad we did.’‘The stonewall riots were not only a moment in time and history, but a real signal that we are not a community that is to stay quiet and remain silenced.’‘However we should remember that there are so many stories of queer join, pain, struggle and victory out there to be discovered, if we take the time to look for them.’‘While many of us feel safe and accepted, Pride is about remembering that there are still people in the world who don’t. Until that day we need to keep pushing for total equality and acceptance for the whole of the LGBT+ community.’5050 Carrie Lyell, journalist and editor-in-chief of DIVA magazine‘What I know about Stonewall, I had to scrape together myself. So today, as editor of DIVA magazine, I feel I have a duty to keep the spirit and the stories of that night alive so those growing up don\u0027t need to hunt as I did.’The unnamed 27-year-old was reportedly told by officials his behaviour was “not authentic” in a high-profile asylum case last year.The decision was the second time Austrian authorities had refused an asylum case on the grounds they did not believe the applicant was gay.The treatment of LGBT+ asylum seekers in Britain has also come under the spotlight\u0026nbspamid\u0026nbspreports of vulnerable\u0026nbspapplicants struggling to provide adequate proof of their sexuality.The proportion of asylum claims from members of the LGBT+ community that have been rejected by the Home Office has surged in recent years, government data released last year showed.In total, 78 per cent of asylum claims that included a reference to sexual orientation were refused last year 1,464 people – up from 964 rejected claims in 2015.This is what LGBTQI+ people go through to gain asylum in the UKDr Tschalaer’s study found people who were more open about their sexuality and gender identity in their country of origin as well as the country of arrival were much more likely to be granted asylum, in part because they were more likely to receive support for the preparation of their asylum interview.Her research suggested\u0026nbspthose who felt unable to be open about their sexuality prior to leaving their home country were at a disadvantage when applying for asylum.LGBTQI+ asylum seekers who felt forced to hide their sexuality andor gender identity, and who felt uncomfortable talking about it were usually rejected, as were those who were married or had children in their countries of origin,” she said.“This was either because they were not recognised or believed as being LGBTQI+, or because they were told to hide in their country of origin since they had not come out yet.”anti-LGBT+ countries in Europe, according to ILGA-EuropeLeila Zadeh, director of the UK Lesbian \u0026amp Gay Immigration Group (UKLGIG), urged European governments to stop basing decisions on whether to grant asylum to LGBTQI+ people based on a person’s ability to articulate a coming out story’ in line with Western stereotypes”.She told The Independent: UKLGIG research has similarly found that the Home Office sometimes refuses refugee status to LGBTQI+ people who find it hard to speak about their sexual orientation.\u0026nbspThey told one person who they refused that their story was \u0027wholly lacking in compelling detail or any emotive terminology\u0027.\u0026nbspThis fails to recognise that in many parts of the world it is taboo to talk about emotions and relationships. People who do not conform to a society\u0027s gender norms may never have spoken about their sexuality or gender identity at all. European governments should stop basing decisions on whether to grant asylum to LGBTQI+ people based on a person’s ability to articulate a ‘coming out story’ in line with Western stereotypes”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The overall decline marks the longest period of falling sales since 2011.“Despite the recent pick-up we’ve seen in households’ real earnings, the sun is clearly not shining on the British high street,” said Rain Newton-Smith, chief economist at the CBI, which represents British businesses.Strong growth in grocers’ sales was outweighed by steep falls at department stores, clothing retailers and other shops.Another measure, which strips out seasonal variations in sales, also pointed to weakness: a balance of -20 per cent of retailers said sales were good for the time of year.\u0026nbspCompared with recent lows, firms expect\u0026nbspa slight pick-up in their fortunes in August, predicting sales will be broadly flat on a year ago.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson waves as he enters 10 Downing Street following his appointment as Prime Minster by the Queen.

He pointed out that the sharp fall in sales recorded in the June survey was at odds with a healthy rise in sales subsequently reported by government statisticians.However, the factors that have supported consumer spending this year may be starting to fade, he said. He pointed to a recent slowdown in employment growth and evidence from surveys that pay rises are running out of steam.In addition, with UK consumers saving a very low share of their income, they may “at the very least” want to stop dipping into their savings, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, he said.“Meanwhile, lenders have cut back on the availability of unsecured consumer credit,” he added.The CBI survey was conducted between 27 June and 16 July.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

HMS Montrose, a British frigate now in the area, carried out the first mission under the new policy on Wednesday evening.Mr Zonnour’s comments come a day after Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani suggested that the return of the Grace 1 would result in a reciprocal move from Iran.\u0026nbspIf Britain steps away from the wrong actions in Gibraltar, they will receive an appropriate response from Iran, Mr Rouhani said.\u0026nbsp Britain’s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, has yet to comment on the suggestion, but the solution was given backing by his father.Speaking to Press TV shortly after his son won the race to become Britain’s new PM on Wednesday, Stanley Johnson said he was looking forward to see Boris “building bridges with Iran and that it would be\u0026nbsp“easy peasy” to solve the crisis.“Of course you have this situation at the moment where we’ve got your ship which is called Stella, you’ve got our ship, which is called something else,” he said.“Well, the best thing would be to say, look, we let your ship go, you let our ship go,” he said.Relatives speak to crew onboard captured UK-flagged tankerThe crisis in the Strait of Hormuz has become part of a larger struggle between Iran and the US – and by proxy the UK – which was sparked when President Donald Trump abandoned a landmark nuclear deal.\u0026nbspTrump called the agreement “defective to its core” and has imposed several rounds of sanctions against Iran in an effort to forge a deal more favourable to the US. His administration justified the withdrawal by claiming increased pressure would further inhibit Iran’s ability to enrich uranium, which could be used for a nuclear weapons programme.The  European Union, which was also a signatory of the deal, has repeatedly stated that the deal was having the desired effect, and has made efforts to salvage the agreement.\u0026nbspBut that broader crisis shows no sign of being resolved.\u0026nbspTrump and Iranian leaders have both publicly said talks were possible, but the prospect for dialogue appeared to recede on Wednesday when the top military adviser to Iran\u0027s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali\u0026nbspKhamenei\u0026nbspsaid Tehran would not negotiate with Washington under any circumstancesUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said\u0026nbspThursday that he remains open to going\u0026nbspto Iran for talks.\u0026nbspAsked if he would be willing to go to Tehran, Mr Pompeo said in an interview with Bloomberg TV: Sure.

In other words, both the No Deal preparation and the proposed deal must be realistic.This is where his key Brexit lieutenants Dominic Cummings and David Frost come in.They might be backroom appointments but they are as —not more — important to the success of Boris’s premiership as the Cabinet appointments he has made.Cummings is a unique figure in Westminster. He is interested in getting things done with little regard to what people think of him and the political niceties.It is thanks to Benedict Cumberbatch that Cummings has attracted something close to celebrity status in political circles. Cumberbatch played Cummings in the TV drama Brexit: The Uncivil War.He captured brilliantly Cummings’ drive and determination to win as the campaign chief for Vote Leave, and the fact he doesn’t care whose ego he ruffles in the process.In his new job, Cummings’ determination is already clear.Yesterday he was meant to be on the operating table under general anaesthetic.But once the offer came from Boris, he cancelled the operation. I am told he won’t have it done now until after October , Boris’s deadline for getting Brexit done.Cummings came in because the chance of getting the Vote Leave team back together to deliver Brexit after three years of drt simply had to be taken. The big challenge for this team is to get the UK ready for a No Deal Brexit.Cummings is well suited to his task. He knows how Whitehall works and how to succeed despite intense opposition he drove through Michael Gove’s Free Schools, which have proved hugely successful, against the objections of the educational establishment.Strikingly, in Boris’s new Government it is now Gove who is in charge of the No Deal planning.Getting the logistics and the necessary contingency plans sorted is one aspect of No Deal planning, and one that was shamefully neglected under Mrs May. But there also needs to be a political strategy for it.Many in the EU are convinced — thanks to the antics of Dominic Grieve, Philip Hammond and co — that Parliament will block No Deal.Or thatthe UK did leave without a deal on Halloween, it would come crawling back by Christmas.So they reckon there is no need to compromise as No Deal either won’t happen or will be only a temporary affair.The best way to deal with both the Parliamentary opposition to No Deal and the belief that the UK would come crawling back is for Boris to take a lead in the polls.If it was clear that a general election would lead to a majority for Boris, then Parliament would be less likely to throw obstacles in his way.That’s why Boris, in his Downing Street speech, tried to address the issues that cost the Tories their majority in : Social care, schools funding and police cuts.If the EU thought that Boris could do No Deal, and could politically sustain it, then it would have to decide whether it was prepared to compromise to avoid No Deal.The Irish Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, would have to decide whether it is worth sticking with a backstop that is going to cause the very thing it was meant to avoid, a hard border on the island of Ireland.Varadkar would also have to consider whether he really wants to go through with No Deal when it would do more damage to the Irish economy than the UK’s. This is where David Frost comes in.No, not the late, great TV personality but the former Foreign Office diplomat who is going to be Boris’s point man for negotiations with the EU.Frost knows his way round the chancelleries of Europe, he is a former Foreign Office Europe Director and he also knows what Boris wants on Brexit.He was his special adviser when Boris was Foreign Secretary and was there when Boris decided to quit over Mrs May’s Chequers plan.His role is to craft a Brexit agreement that delivers what Boris thinks the UK needs AND one that has a chance of being accepted by the EUthe alternative is No Deal. This isn’t going to be easy, and it isn’t going to be done quickly.Those involved admit thatthe EU is going to blink, it will not be until the October EU Council at the earliest, which is just two weeks away from the October  deadline. As one of those working in the new No puts it: “Fasten your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride.”But after years in which the EU thought they had the measure of the British Prime Minister, we now have a team who might just have what it takes to pull Brexit back from the brink. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There, they can enrol in a course on gender studies and emerge in three years with a degree which will not help them one bit to get a decent job.And as a consequence they will be at least £, in debt. But they’ll have a piece of paper which will tell possible employers: “Look — I’ve been a total mug for three years. Gizza job!”The unemployment rate for students at Britain’s worst universities, such as East London and London South Bank, is around about double the national rate for young people.In other words, going to university worsened their chances of getting a job.That’s not what they were led to believe, is it. They were told a university degree would open doors for them. Not slam the doors shut in their spotty faces. And leave them with a whopping loan to pay off.Our young people have been conned for far too long.We have a new Prime Minister now. And I think it would be a good ideahe took a very close look at higher education. OK, he’s got Brexit to sort out first, fine. But by November , this should be his priority.We are misleading our young people. Far too many -year-olds go to university and end up mired in debt, with rotten degrees in stupid subjects. While all students have to scrimp and save to get through their three years.Here’s what I would doI were Education Secretary.End all tuition fees right now. Make university education absolutely free, and make sure those who go get decent living grants.How do we pay for that  Easy. Cut the number of people going to university by  per cent. Not everyone is academically minded. University should be only for those who are.Back when I went to uni only ten per cent of my peer group got in.But for the rest there were apprenticeships. Learning in the workplace. And those sorts of options should be considered not inferior to university, but absolutely equal. And the benefits stressed to the kids.Three years after leaving school a university kid will be earning nothing. If you’ve been on an apprenticeship for three years you’ll be earning a decent whack.We have over-stressed the importance and attraction of a college education to our young people, given them unrealistic expectations and made them pay through the nose for it. And at the same time we’ve devalued education by doing this.So there’s the challenge, Boris. Get on to the private sector and get some more apprenticeships up and running.And close down the awful former polytechnics charging a king’s ransom for a crap degree.ONE of the best things about BoJo becoming Prime Minister is that the perpetually screeching Yasmin Alibhai-Brown has vowed to leave the country.Brown loathes the white English working class.So it was always a mystery to me why she stayed in the country. Seeing as there are quite a lot of white, English, working-class people.Anyway, she vowed to get the hell outJohnson became PM.Trouble is, people say stuff like this but rarely act on it.I suggest we set up a crowdfunding page for her plane ticket and maybe throw in some extra money for en-route snacks and stuff.Off you go to Heathrow, Yazza.I MADE a list a few weeks ago about the  things I most dislike in the world.At No was Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.At No was Taylor Swt.And No was cats .So take a guess as to what new film I’m not going to be watching any time soon It’s my nightmare, all wrapped up in two hours.CARL BEECH made a series of outrageous claims of sexual abuse, torture and murder by members of the old Conservative establishment.This serial liar and fantasist will soon be sentenced for his crimes.The reason the police believed this madman is because they have been told they must. They are no longer allowed to employ common sense.In order to be politically correct they have had to shed all semblance of judgment.THE job of a bookshop, you would have thought, is to sell books.Trouble is, they are useless at it. They are politically biased and cater solely to a tiny minority of gibbering liberals.I’ve got a book out at the moment, called The Great Betrayal – The True Story Of Brexit. I’ve had complaints from people who want to read it that they can’t find it in bookshops.The bookshop staff say they thought there wouldn’t be any interest in it. But it was the No best-seller in the country and was No on Amazon worldwide. It’s pure political bias.If you want the book – go on Amazon.TOP prize in the “Most Rational and Measured Response to Boris Johnson Becoming Prime Minister” goes to – of course – .For this headline: “The Clown Is Crowned As The Country Burns In Hell.”Followed by , words of hysterical drivel.Brilliant. The Left really don’t like it when they don’t get their own way.Anyway, this is but the first example of BDS – Boris Derangement Syndrome. Don’t worry. Lots more of it to come.MAGIC grandpa has a cunning plan!The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced to the Press that he was going to “surprise Boris Johnson” by calling a vote of no confidence.Here’s a tip, you Jew-bothering, bearded c**kwomble.If you want something to be a surprise for someone, don’t tell every newspaper in the country.THE Islamist crackpots in Iran have hijacked two of our oil tankers. Causing a pretty grave crisis.But why isn’t the Royal Navy escorting British ships through the Strait of Hormuz, when we know the danger  Andthey’re not ready yet to do that, why did we impound an Iranian tanker three weeks ago, knowing there would be reprisals We have been naive and underprepared. I’m not sure anyone has noticed yet.Anyway, she immediately demonstrated her full-blooded support for democracy.She said evenpeople voted leave in a second referendum, she’d still ignore it.Swimsuit only likes democracy when people vote the way she wants. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

According to the photographer Robert Kenneth Wilson, he managed to capture the image while he was looking at the lake. The image though was exposed as a huge hoax in the  book, Nessie – the Surgeon’s Photograph Exposed.Holmes videoLab technician Gordon Holmes claimed he had managed to film the monster in  which he described as this jet black thing, about  metreslong, moving fairly fast in the water. Both BBC Scotland and STV aired the footage at the time which marine biologist Adrian Shine described as among “the best footage [he had] ever seen.”Some distance from the two objects, in the centre of the frame, a larger object can be seen which is a passing boat.They are seen moving through the water, but many believe they could easily be logs caught in the waves.Eoin said: “I have never seen two objects so close to each other on the webcam before and I have been watching for years. Their shape in the water is very strange.“What are they, I dont know. They could be two Nessies.”Eoin claims he has now spotted the Loch Ness Monster four times, three times in  alone.Takala, a scientist who has been researching Loch Ness for over  years, said: There has been a slight increase in surface temperatures in Loch Ness due to climate change.It is possible that a cold blooded creature like Nessie may be encouraged toand or stay longer in the warming waters of Loch Ness. Ive always believed there has to be a family of unknown creatures in the loch, albeit a small one.Its too much of a stretch to believe that a single creature can live for hundreds,not thousands of years or more.Also, there are cave like formations near Urquhart Castle, known as Edwards Deep and no attempt has ever been made to seethese are navigable.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I don’t know what could be worse than that.”Her leg was swollen and blistering — a rash creeping ever higher up — and her skin turning black and falling off.She finally went to the hospital, where she was diagnosed with pseudomonas folliculitis — a common skin infection which can become lethaluntreated.Docs suspected she got the infection from hot-tubbing during her holiday away.Taylor told RTV:“Every night, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, we were in the hot tub and [my doctor] was like, ‘That’s the only way I thought you could get this infection was from a hot tub.’ ”It’s caused by certain types of bacteria that thrive in warm, wet areas.It can occur in any hot tub, but the bacteria that cause it are particularly prone to thriving in wooden tubs.The primary symptom of hot tub folliculitis is a bumpy, red rash that’s often itchy.The bumps may be filled with pus, and they can resemble acne.This rash may develop anywhere from a few hours to several days after exposure.After it initially forms, the rash may develop into dark red nodules that are tender or painful.The rash may appear on the chest where the water level commonly hits.Or it may only appear in areas under the swimsuit, where the water and bacteria may have been trapped for longer.Some people with this infection may feel a general sense of being unwell.They may have a sore throat, earache, nausea, or headache.It’s most common in hot tubs and warm pools that aren’t treated regularly or thoroughly.These bacteria can cause an infection in the hair follicles of the skin.However, this infection can’t be transmitted from person to person.Source: HealthlineAn infectious disease specialist told her amputation was a possibility — but after two weeks on IV antibiotics, she was able to fight off the infection.She is walking again but still gets emotional when recalling the pain of the experience.She added: “At first I was thankful to have my leg but more so, thankful to be alive.”Folliculitis is so frequently contracted in bubbling, heated pools that the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention dubbed it “Hot Tub Rash,” or an infection of hair follicles marked by puss-filled pimples, according to Mayo Clinic.Taylor says her specialist told her a common grooming activity clears the way for it to enter your body, saying: “When you shave your legs you are breaking skin so that’s opening areas on your legs.”To protect le and limb, experts recommend removing swimsuits and showering soon after taking a soak.A version of this story originally appeared on New York Post."},{"url":null,"title":"residents eyesore artificial oak tree london hampstead","story":"Residents of the leafy London suburb have branded the fake foliage an “eyesore” and are complaining to the local council.Battle lines between locals and Camden Council have been drawn on Well Road since the synthetic sapling went up, the Camden New Journal reports.One objection reads: “Of all the ridiculous things we have to endure in Hampstead, I think this has to be the daftest.”Property consultants insist the brown and green fake tree bolted to a plinth outside a recently built house should be granted a “lawful development certicate”.But locals are adamant that planners should rule that it is not the right fit for the area.Another “This plastic tree resembles Disneyland.“It is ugly, un-eco friendly and not in keeping with nature, the Heath and Hampstead. It’s a pathetic eyesore.”Another resident added: “Plastic should be made illegal in this country, let alone an ugly plastic tree in a conservation area.“Camden must be ahead of the curve and not let this eyesore remain.”Another even predicted that it would turn blue over time.Although several neighbours suggested the tree is made of plastic, the Pegasus Group, which submitted the application, said the tree is made of fibreglass with an aluminium frame.Residents living close to the Heath have long treasured Well Road, formerly home to novelist Daphne du Maurier, for its ornate lampposts and leafy trees.The objections, published on Camden Council’s planning website, however, show neighbours are unimpressed with the new addition.But that can changethe specied use of the building changes materially without a planning application being submitted.Material change would mean, for example, a residential property becoming a personal one.The certicate is not the same as planning permission.One thundered: “It’s an eyesore and could be a precedent for much worse.“If it was a giant gnome would it be allowed “Lowers the tone of the neighbourhood. Out of keeping with local architecture. Environmentally unfriendly.

travelling through the Strait of Hormuz be accompanied after the seizure of a British vessel last week.On Friday, Iran seized British oil tanker the Stena Impero in response to Britains seizure of an Iranian vessel off Gibraltar earlier this month.The escort was provided by HMS Montrose, currently Britains only warship in the Gulf and soon to be replaced by the larger HMS Duncan.A nuclear powered submarine and Royal Marine Commandos could also be sent to bolster defences.A government spokesperson said: The Royal Navy has been tasked to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz, either inidually or in groups, should sufficient notice be given of their passage.Freedom of navigation is crucial for the global trading system and world economy, and we will do all we can to defend it.The move came just hours after Boris Johnson took office as prime minister.US president Donald Trump has also deployed a large military presence in the Gulf in response to what the US called Iranian threats.Currents tensions between the UK and Iran began when royal marines said an Iranian tanker, the Grace , at the request of the US.The ship was suspected of taking oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions, and remains detained in Gibraltar.Under the new Royal Navy escort mission, UK-flagged ships have been told to give the Department of Transport sufficient notice of their travel plans in the area, Sky News reports.Ships might be grouped together in convoys or accompanied inidually depending upon how many are travelling on a given day.Britain has been seeking to put together a European-led maritime protection mission to ensure safe shipping through the Strait of Hormuz.Last Friday, Irans Revolutionary Guard launched a gunboat and helicopter raid on the Stena Impero, which is registered in the UK, claiming it had turned off its tracker and ignored warnings.The seizure was described as an state piracy by the British government.Another vessel, the Mesdar, was also intercepted and forced towards Iranian territory in what appeared to be a co-ordinated strike.State TV footage shows Iranian armed forces on board the Stena Impero after it was seized in the Strait of Hormuz.The clip is thought to have been filmed in the southern port of Bandar Abbas.Startling satellite images have also emerged showing the captured ship being circled by a military speedboat.Iran responded to British demands that the ship be released by offering to swap the vessel for the Grace .Prior to seizing the Stena Impero, Iran had warned the UK that the capture of the Grace  would not go unanswered, and had since said it uses drones to track every ship in the Gulf.The Revolutionary Guard said their “world leading drones” were following “all enemy ships” and taking pictures “point-by-point from their origin until the moment they enter the region”.It has also emerged Tehran wants to impose a toll on all ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz, saying it would be used to protect the safety of the vessels.Mohammad Javad Zar, the Iranian foreign minister, has insisted his country doesnt want confrontation.It is very important for Boris Johnson as he enters  Downing Street to understand that Iran does not seek confrontation, that Iran wants normal relations based on mutual respect, he said.Fears have recently been raised that the Royal Navy lacks the strength to conduct missions to protect UK shipping.Since the Falklands War, the navy has dropped from  vessels to , with ten of those currently out of action for

Later that day and a few hours after her daughter Lily had a single slice of the meat she fell ill, displaying classic symptoms of food poisoning. It wasnapost until the following day however that the family realised something truly disgusting had happened. Jessicaaposs mother called her at the care home she works at to explain that the ham was covered with live maggots which had presumably hatched over night.    I was absolutely terried, the -year-old said. I phoned the doctor from work straight away. The thought of having Lily eating something like that is truly disgusting. A day later Jessicaaposs disgust was intensied when she found maggots crawling in her daughteraposs nappy.    She had really severe vomiting for ten days, Jessica explained. She was in and out of the doctors and hospital. They just branded it as food poisoning. Sheaposs only one and sheaposs turned to bone. Sheaposs small anyway.    Everything was really visible.

Although she doesnapost blame Sainsburyaposs for the maggot infested ham, the mum-of-one is less than impressed by the supermarkets ability to keep a promise.

Carl Beech, once only known in media reports as Nick, was convicted of  counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud. Beech made the claims of a Westminster VIP paedophile ring dating back to the s and s. The politan Police investigated his allegations, raiding homes and interviewing alleged suspects - but the £ million Operation Midland ended without making a single arrest. Northumbria Police was later tasked with investigating his claims. Beechaposs malicious deceit ruined the reputations of those he accused and led the politan Police to raid the homes of -year-old Normandy veteran Field Marshall Lord Bramall - the late Lord Brittan - and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.    Mr Proctor blasted the force, calling the episode a truly disgraceful chapter in the history of British policing. Speaking during his sentencing hearing, prosecutor Tony Badenoch QC said: In this case, the defendantaposs conduct amounted to the cynical manipulation of the criminal justice system on an unprecedented scale.He said that the offences demonstrated an unparalleled cruelty and disregard towards those who he wrongly accused.Mr Badenoch added: These offences were motivated by entirely selfish purposes.The prosecutor said that it was clear that Beech was aware that his accusations were of the most serious nature and that the stories he invented to detectives would be-front page news. He said: He also sought to inject himself into and thereby pervert the Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse.  The prosecution has alleged Beech, , from Gloucester, deliberately and persistently lied to police and fraudulently claimed £, in criminal injuries compensation. The prosecution described him as a manipulative paedophile after telling the jury he has previously admitted downloading indecent images of boys, and voyeurism. Mr Badenoch said during the two-month trial that the orced father-of-one had shown breathtaking hypocrisy in accusing others of child sex abuse while he was pursuing an interest in boys himself. Beech told detectives over hours of tearful interviews how his late step-father, an Army Major, raped him, then passed him on to generals to be tortured at military bases and sadistically sexually abused by other Establishment figures in the s and s.  He named former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, his sworn enemy Mr Proctor, disgraced TV star Jimmy Savile and security chiefs Sir Michael Hanley, the head of MI, and MI boss Sir Maurice Oldfield among the gang after meeting a journalist from the defunct news agency Exaro. He claimed a schoolboy named Scott was deliberately knocked down and killed, that another boy who might have been the missing teenager Martin Allen was raped and strangled in front of him and said another youth was battered to death by the ring. Daniel Janner QC, whose father Lord Janner of Braunstone QC faced allegations before he died, said police must be held accountable after a jury ed guilty verdicts for the fantasist who ly claimed to have been a victim of a powerful VIP paedophile ring.

The -year-old said: Geordie was always the lonesome one on the street. “The reason for that was Geordie’s sister Lily died very young. “I don’t know what happened, but I remember the horses coming to the street, we had never seen horses on a hearse. “We couldn’t believe it when we saw the coffin going in, it was scary at the time. “After the daughter died, his motherwas a changed woman. I know she had a husband , but Geordie was her le.    “If he wasn’t home at a certain time from school she would have been going round to seehe was there. If Geordie went on the road on a message, she’d have gone looking him - so he never played football or run about with friends. “He always sat in his mummy’s door and she always sat on her wee stool. He went on walks in the day and would come back at night. “They lived in Keatley Street then, that’s where I was born and reared and that’s where Geordie was born and reared. “When they knocked the houses down Geordie went to live in Harvey Street and we went to live in McMaster Street - but we were only actually one street away.” When Geordieaposs parents died several decades ago he was left with no close family. Cecil said his parents took Geordie under their wing, a kindness the pensioner repaid with generous gts. “My mother would have cooked for him when his mother died - she got him his shopping and did his ironing for the next  years and then when my mother died, my father did it,” he continued. “Geordie couldn’t have cooked nothing. “When my mother died he would have sat and talked to my father for hours, but what they talked I will never know.” While he was a smart pupil, Geordie left school at  and went to work at Harland and Wolff shipyard. There he worked on the cranes and in the yard until he took redundancy. “He was a friendly fella, but he was not a mixer. He was a great guy, but a hard guy to read,” Cecil continued. “He was in the shipyard all his le. He worked on the cranes and then he just helped about the yard. He took his redundancy when he was in his s.” Geordie enjoyed walking, sweet treats and a bargain. “He was the most generous fella you would have ever met in your le,” Cecil added. “If a kid was playing in the street he would call them over and give them a handful of sweets - but he wouldn’t say nothing to them or anything. “He had a heart of corn. He was happy as long as he had a pocket full of sweets and a house full of grapes and stuff and called into the fish shop - that was Geordie.” "},{"url":null,"title":"freak accident forces bride groom","story":"NewsFreak accident forces bride and groom to spend their wedding night in AEDavid Phillips and his we Jordan enjoyed a dream wedding at Clearwell Castle before the groom was left covered in bloodShareByAnna Lewis:,  JUL NewsDavid Phillips and his newly-wed we Jordan found themselves in AE on their big day \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA newly-married couple ended up spending their wedding night in AE after a freak accident left the groom covered in blood.

What she didnapost realise - as the sun beat down on her - was that something was going on below her waist. It was only when she got home and stripped off her branded Adidas leggings that she realised what had happened. The logo of the sportswear company had been negatively branded onto her skin, with the burnt red area around the letters highlighting the pale skin of the German clothing firm. It was when I went to put on my bikini that I saw my leg, Danielle said. I thought aposOh my godapos. I was in fits of laughter.  Suspecting that the logo will fade from her leg by the morning, the Poole, Dorset woman was quick to capitalise on the unusual occurence. As well as collecting loads of shares when she posted it online, Danielle contacted Adidas askingthey would hire her as an on-brand model. Sadly the company turned down her request, complementing her on a nice tan before admitting it only took sponsorship bids from Australia and Germany. Danielle seems to have drawn a particularly unlucky card.    According to Bupa, leggings are typically a very good item of clothing to stave off sunburn. Long pants or leggings cover more skin than shorts, and a broad brim hat provides more protection than a baseball cap, the private health firm explained.

The men appear to be soaked through and are drenched in sweat due to the extreme heat. Did you suffer from transport hell today  Email webnews@mirror  One man is desperately fanning his baby trying to keep them cool as temperatures reached .C in parts of the UK. The heatwave today saw overhead lines near Peterborough get damaged - causing travel chaos for thousands. Police officers were called to help dehydrated passengers from the train and one man collapsed on the tracks outside.  Jack Moss wrote on Twitter : LNER are holding people in inhumane conditions. People are passing out and being sick. It’s plus  degrees and we are being held with no way of getting off or knowing how long this is for. He added: People are passing out andthis keeps up someone will die.  He was on the train to London but eventually had to abandon public transport and get a taxi - which he promises to charge LNER for. Another passenger called Dave Martin replied: Disgraceful I was on this train totally dehydrated completely uncomfortable - kids and elderly suffering worse.He wrote on his own Twitter account: thanks to @LNER I now knowyou sweat for long enough your fingers go wrinkly like being in water too long.Really didn’t need to discover that! should have got people off the train faster.  In reply to Jack, LNER wrote they were apostrying their hardest to resolve the situationapos and that this is absolutely not the service we aim to provide. Iaposm so sorry. LNER, which runs inter-city services on the East Coast Main Line, warned at pm that customers should not attempt to travel today. Tickets for today will be honoured tomorrow - but there have been warnings delays could continue. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said the disruption was particularly bad in London and the South East and warned it could continue until the weekend.  Robert Nisbet, director of nations and regions at the group, told the BBC  out of  train companies had been affected by cancellations and speed restrictions. “We believe there could be roll-on impacts tomorrow, because many of the trains will be in the wrong places, many of the rail staff will be in the wrong places and it will take time to re-set, to stabilise the timetable again,” he said. Network Railaposs network services director Nick King said: We have a number of heat-related incidents across the rail network this evening that are causing disruption to services.

Alicia Dillon from Little Sutton, Cheshire, suffers from ulcerative colitis , which causes recurring diarrhoea and extreme fatigue.She contacted Ryanair to request a free allocated seat due to her condition, report the Liverpool Echo.She says she has done successfully with other airlines including easyJet and British Airways. The -year-old, who is a frequent flyer, is due to fly to Alicante in Spain with her grandmother and boyfriend on August .    But she claims she was refused a free seat by Ryanair as her condition did not meet its disability policy - and instead was told she can only purchase the seat for £. Alicia, a travel consultant, said: It is disgraceful. I donapost know what gives Ryanair the authority to decide what a disability is and not. I was in shock at the ignorance. I told them that I could provide medical proof even though I would be having to disclose personal information, which I shouldnapost have to, but I was still told no. I have flown loads before with easyJet and British Airways and no questions have ever been asked.  Alicia said she first contacted Ryanair through its online service as a precaution, to request an aisle seat near a toilet, but was met with what she described as a aposscripted replyapos. Her grandmother, who has reduced mobility, was allocated a seat, as was Aliciaaposs boyfriend to act as her carer. Yet despite going into detail about her condition, Alicia was told she would have to pay for hers. On its website, Ryanairaposs policy states: Customers who have limited mobility in the cabin or who are using therapeutic oxygen, an Amsafe, Crelling harness or Meru chair will be allocated a suitable seat onboard free of charge along with one travel companion.    These customers will be boarded after general boarding is completed. The website also states that passengers travelling with guide assistance dogs, with limited or no mobility in the cabin, with an intellectual disability, blind vision impaired requiring assistance - will be provided support and an allocated seat. Aliciaaposs message to Ryanair read: My grandmother is already listed as limited mobility however my partner Matthew will be assisting her. However I require seat allocation near to a toilet as possible due to suffering with an autoimmune disease ulcerative colitis which affects the bowel. I will be bringing injections on board with storage supplied by myself and a medical letter for customs.    However a representative for Ryanair responded: We can only allocate passengers with reduced mobility. F is free for you, you can purchase it from the website. Following the reply Alicia and her boyfriend contacted a manager - but despite going into detail about her symptoms was met with the same reply. Alicia said: It made me feel absolutely awful and embarrassed. If I have a flare up, my immune system attacks itself and I can get sudden onset diarrhoea. My joints can become very achey, especially my coccyx and I get chronic fatigue which feels like I have been hit by the flu.

The troubled student, who had been battling depression, bought the stimulant legally off eBay after posting a number of harrowing messages on the social media site Reddit indicating she wanted to take her own le. Sophia was found dead in her room last March  at Byron House halls. A note she wrote said: Iaposm tired on putting in this facade. Iaposm tired of putting on a fake smile when Iaposm emotionally dying. It emerged the stimulant packet she bought had no warnings about dosage or excessive usage. The student was subsequently awarded a posthumous first class degree from the university. At an inquest coroner Alan Walsh recorded a verdict of suicide and said: I have been a coroner sitting at this court for more than  years and this is the first ever death from caffeine toxicity which is a very unusual cause of death.    Sophia was a very bright and super intelligent young lady with a supportive family who did well on her uni course and she had a lot of support from the people in her flat. Itaposs something to be credited as she received a first class degree posthumously at the graduation last week that tells me she was super intelligent and she was capable of researching subjects including caffeine. Those message sheaposs logged on Reddit were very clear yet she was extremely capable of covering her intentions. On March th she was laughing about parking a car and laughing with her sister and parents. She covered everything that must have been in her thoughts and itaposs quite astonishing she had the intentions able to carry with these inner thoughts. Mr Walsh continued: All these examples show that a lot of people were reassured of that fact she wouldnapost harm herself yet the note she left in her room has a clear indication of intention. I find it extremely sad when somebody on the outside is happy when they are having these thoughts. It was her choice she made it clear she didnapost want her family to feel any guilt. She wanted to carry out her intention and she wanted people to respect this as her intention. I am extremely saddened, she was , a super bright, highly educated young lady.    The Bolton hearing was told Sophia, from Telford, Shropshire had been diagnosed with Aspergeraposs syndrome but did well at school and college. She initially went to Sheffield university to study bioengineering, but she left in the first year and enrolled on a three year a biomedicine studies course at Salford in . Her father Jimmy Singh told the hearing: She was coping really well with it and she was in the top of her year. She would have got a first and there wasnapost any academic problem. At the graduation ceremony last week they made a posthumous certicate for her. She coped with her studies. As for us, we were aware she managed to do her own educating, she wasnapost in any special problems. She was last home between July and September , there were no problems. She came home, she would occasionally go out and visit friends and she worked as an usherette on occasions. She also did a week of work experience at the local hospital. But in the weeks before her death, Sophiaaposs family had become concerned about her not responding to social media messages. They were then contacted by her boyfriend who became worried about Sophiaaposs mental health when he saw her posts on Reddit. One post said: Before next week by Monday. Iaposm ready to go. I have nothing left. I canapost stop thinking about suicide and NEED to go. Another read: Last weekend here on planet Earth.  The hearing was told Sophieaposs sister Sarah took her to hospital on March  but she was discharged and advised to see her GP. Mr Singh added: Sarah said she seemed in quite good spirits, she was laughing about how dficult it was to park and how they couldnapost find a parking space near the Accident and Emergency unit. If she said anything about ending her le, she would say, aposItaposd be better offIaposm deadapos, but it was sort of off-the-cuff. We werenapost aware of any attempt she made to harm herself. We later found out after she died that she had bought caffeine powder, which can be toxic when taken in excess. She would have researched it in some way. It was bought on eBay. There was no suggestion of dosage, there were no warning signs , it was just like sugar. Sophia didnapost reach out for extra help with any services. Lots of people saw her the day before her death. Sarah Singh said: She was happy for me to take her to hospital. She admitted she had ordered something but it hadnapost arrived yet. She was upbeat and laughing on the way there.

Asked  direct questions by Jeremy Corbyn, he failed to answer a single one. Instead he showed contempt for the Com­mons and the public by showboating when he should have been serious and blustering when he should have been straightforward. It is hardly surprising he is running from scrutiny when he has such a cavalier approach. He is recklessly driving us towards a no-deal Brexit without any care for the consequences. If we crash out it will put firms and farmers out of business, threaten medical supplies and force food bills to rise. Those who will suffer will not be the PM and his privileged friends but the towns and communities which can least afford it. What became clear yesterday is that Johnson is interested only in his own survival. His Brexit strategy has nothing to do with what is best for the country and everything to do with heading off Nigel Farage.  Hot and hotter Few on holiday will complain about yesterday’s record temperatures. The heatwave is also great news for our seaside resorts. But is less welcome for people stuck at work or having to travel on the badly disrupted rail network. We used to joke that the British summer started on the last day of July and ended on the first day of August. Not any more.  Scientists agree that the extreme weather is linked to climate change. The five hottest summers in Europe since  have been in the last  years. Unless we act, these weather patterns will be become more frequent and more intense.

Fran Drake, now , struggled with her size for much of her le after turning to comfort food when cruel school bullies nicknamed her aposFat Franapos. Over the years she tried a handful of diets, including the : diet, but none of them kept the pounds off for long and she was stuck around a size . So she decided just to accept her body, and before long her confidence grew dramatically. She said: If I couldnapost change myself physically, I was going to change myself mentally.    Just because youaposre not a size  doesnapost mean you canapost be happy in yourself. And in  – then a size  - she started dating Matt after they got talking at a Christmas party. Bagging myself a fit man really reinforced the idea that I could be happy in my own skin without losing any weight,” she said. I was never confident when it came to dating before I met Matt. I always ended up with men that didnapost appreciate me and I thought I didn’t deserve any better because of my weight.    “But the problem was that after settling into a happy relationship and feeling more confident in myself, I started to eat more and more. Though her relationship with Matt was great, Fran saw her diet go from bad to worse and on a typical day, she would eat , calories a day – almost double the NHS recommended daily amount for women of , cals. Discussing Mattaposs naturally athletic build, she said: On nights out people would whisper, aposSheaposs punchingapos - like I didnapost know that he was in much better shape than me already. Things reached an all time low when she was flicking through photos from the trip of a letime to Walt Disney World, Florida, in April , and was reduced to tears at realising just how overweight she had become. From there, Fran, of Bournemouth, Dorset, ditched her diet of Pop Tarts and cheese-laden pasta bakes, and before long the pounds began to melt away. Now, she has shed a mammoth  stone, slimming to a  stone size eight – and has even fulfilled her ambition of becoming a trainee firefighter.  She said: I convinced myself before jetting off to Florida that Iaposd lost enough weight to finally look good on holiday, when in reality Iaposd lost a few pounds and was still grossly overweight. Now Iaposm healthier than ever, Iaposm finally training with the fire brigade and doing something meaningful with my le for the first time in what feels like forever. Since childhood, Fran, who married carpenter Matt on May ,  at Kingston Maurward, an th century mansion house in Dorchester, Dorset, has battled with her weight. As a result, she was teased mercilessly at school, which left her confidence in shreds. She recalled: Children have a knack for snfing out your biggest insecurity and making you feel  times worse about it. Unfortunately, my weakness wasnapost too hard to spot - my weight - and from the age of , I was referred to as aposfat Franapos or aposFatty-escaapos. I grew up in a household where,something was going wrong, youaposd cheer yourself up with something hearty and filling, and thataposs how I got locked into a vicious cycle.    After leaving school and landing a job working in patient services for the NHS, Franfell into a cycle of yo-yo dieting. By , Fran found herself squeezing into a size  and tipping the scales at  stone. That April, she and Matt booked to go to Walt Disney World and, though she was still feeling relatively confident, she decided to try her hand at dieting once more ahead of the trip. I was still very much of the mindset that I was happy with how I looked but wanted to be a bit trimmer for Florida, she recalled. I gave the : diet another whirl and was thrilled to lose a few extra pounds. “I managed to drop a dress size down to a , and I was actually really happy. “Florida was amazing too – the trip of a letime.”  But Fran’s dream holiday soon became a nightmare when, back in the UK, she decided to leaf through the photos she had taken and was left shocked at how she looked. I donapost know what it was about those particular set of photos, but it suddenly dawned on me thatI didnapost change now, my weight was going to kill me, she said. It all finally hit me, and I decided to overhaul my lestyle there and then. Signing up to her local slimming group in April , Fran swapped the junk food she had been living on for fresh home-cooked meals, veggie casseroles and fruit salads. Losing over six stone in a year, she was able to fit into a svelte size  corset dress by the time her wedding day rolled round in May . Remembering her special day, she said: Looking back, I canapost imagine what I would have looked like walking down the aisle in a size  wedding dress.    I can look back through my wedding day photos and smile at the happy memories without any self-loathing. Throwing herself into exercise, Fran also began hitting the gym three times a week, having regular personal training sessions. To fuel her workouts, she upped her protein intake with supplement brand Bio-synergy. Able to do things she never thought possible, from training in the gym to going on country walks with Matt, Fran found herself wanting to put her newfound fitness to use. Iaposd always admired firefighters and growing up I thought it would be ace to work as one, but because of my weight the idea soon fell off my radar, she said.

Fraser continued to say that aposbeware of the dogapos signs are pointless becausethe dog can move around in the house then so can a burglar. He added that people should install as much security to their home as possible - especially a doorbell with a camera. The problem is an opportunist always looks for a house where there is absolutely no security. The more you do to your house, the more likely they are to move on and go to another house, he said.

It will also keep business rates at a sensible level, at no loss to the council. This will benefit Reform Street and the city centre.”The application by West One, based in the city’s Blinshall Street, is the first by any party to bring the amusement arcade back into use.But the plan comes hot on the heels of a blip in confidence among business owners on Reform Street, who spoken of its “second album syndrome” following a resurgence in food outlets that began with Project Pizza in .The eatery, initially hailed as the shape of things to come, closed without warning last month and the unit is now advertised for let.Proprietors such as Akky Hayat – who runs German Doner Kebab and Fatburger – say punitive business rates are discouraging others from opening shops on the street.Mr Chadwick has not been discouraged. He added: “Footfall is rising and there are positive steps in the regeneration of the area.“The demise of Project Pizza is a minor setback to a street that is on the up.”However, it is hard to ignore the units once home to Victoria Wine, TSB and Swinton Insurance, which have remained conspicuously empty long after they have closed."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/5d077b2511d578.29027818-e1560779961602.jpg ","title":"a look back at some of dundee uniteds most famous foes including messi and gazza","story":"Dundee United’s final friendly of the summer comes on Saturday when preparations for the build-up to the Championship season are completed with a -mile trip south to face Shrewsbury Town.The game will be a valuable exercise for boss Robbie Neilson as he makes sure his players have had enough game time to be ready for the opener against Inverness on Saturday week.In terms of prestige, there’s no denying the English League One opposition fall into the “modest” category.There was a time, though, when the Tangerines were in the habit of hosting top opposition at this time of year.It led to some great occasions – and great victories – at Tannadice. Today the Tele looks back at some of those memorable days.DUNDEE UTD  SPURS Tuesday, August , Att: ,A Spurs side that boasted the likes of Argentine World Cup winners Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa, England’s Glenn Hoddle and the new strike partnership of Steve Archibald and Garth Crooks, were blown away by a United side that would reach the peak of its powers over the next few seasons.The Londoners started well and led through a Crooks goal as early as the th minute but, by the break, Billy Kirwood had levelled.After the interval, Jim McLean’s men stepped up a gear and goals from Graeme Payne, Derek Addison and Paul Sturrock gave them a handsome victory over a team that, within a year, would win a classic FA Cup Final against Manchester City.DUNDEE UTD  ASTON VILLA Sunday, August , Att: ,A year before that superb display against Spurs, United entertained Aston Villa, with striker Paul Sturrock once again to the fore.With United dominating from start to finish, “Luggy” bagged a hat-trick to send Ron Saunders’ outfit heading back south with their tails between their legs.If not too much was made about the victory, it was a sign the Tangerines were on the verge of big things and, within months, McLean’s team would secure the club’s first major honour in the shape of the League Cup.It’s also worth remembering, in just two years, Villa would be champions of England and, a year later, more than half the team that ran out at Tannadice would start their winning European Cup Final against Bayern Munich.DUNDEE UTD  EVERTON Tuesday, July , Att: ,.This game was a testimonial for long-serving Maurice Malpas, with his influential former coach Walter Smith bringing Everton to mark the occasion.If the English Premier League giants were already a sizeable draw, their signing of Paul Gascoigne, who would make his debut, brought extra attention that saw news as well as football media heading for Tannadice, although tragic events in Paris as a Concorde crashed, meant, ultimately, actual coverage of it was limited.As was often the case with Gazza, trouble was not far away. He had a first-half flare-up with Joachim Fernandez that saw the home trialist take such exception that boss Paul Sturrock took him off before he was sent off.Malpas’ big night was marked with a win, David Weir giving the visitors the lead before two goals in three second-half minutes from Steven Thompson and Alex Mathie turned things round.DUNDEE UNITED  BARCELONA Saturday, July , Att: ,For the second year running, the Catalan giants had used United’s St Andrews University training base for the first week of their pre-season build-up and that meant fans were treated to a second summer friendly in a row against them at Tannadice.A year earlier, minus Lionel Messi because he was still on holiday, Ronaldinho and Thierry Henry were the stars as a last-gasp goal by the French great gave them victory.With Messi starting, the  friendly saw the Spaniards really turn up as they blasted five past the Tangerines .For once, though, such a reversal was surely acceptable, such was the quality of the opposition and just the sight of one of the world’s greatest players in action meant everyone went home happy.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

Whatever their circumstances, they drew the attention of others and found themselves in court.This is how they came to the attention of another woman from another century: Ros Parkyn. She sadly died only a few weeks ago, but her le was full of stories and love for people, and she had an especially sharp eye for injustice and empathy for people unfairly treated or judged.Ros was browsing in the John Gray Centre in  and noticed a temporary display of mixed objects and records from their collections. There was a volume of court records laid open for perusal and Ros peered at the entries.The entries hadnrsquot been transcribed but she could just make out that they were accounts of the trials of two women who lived in Haddington in . The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

Those plans, approved in August , included the creation of two shops and four flats.However, the design and access statement reads: ldquoSince this permission was obtained, despite evidence of marketing, there has been insufficient interest for its use as shops and flats.ldquoOur clientsrsquo proposal is to redevelop the building for use as a hostel, providing accommodation to visitors to Dunbar, [primarily] those who would take part in the large number of outdoor activities available within the area.ldquoA small flat-roofed single-storey extension to the side is proposed to provide associated laundry room."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9862067.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!! #Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW... https:t.co JVHyTY pic yXRWuCIimPosting on social media the Hydro wrote: \"EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FORGerry Cinnamon.\"Tickets for  +  December are on sale NOW...\"We told previously howCinnamon, , told fans they had \"lost it\"they didnt think hed soon play in Glasgow and his latest output confirmed two December gigs for lucky punters to get excited about.He will also play Aberdeen in November."},{"url":null,"title":"watch-incredible-moment-karaoke-singer-stuns-hamilton-pub-nessun-dorma-performance","story":"William Boyle had the usually rowdy crowd at Bar West at a hushed silence as he bellowed through Paottis famous tune.The clip was posted on social media by user Ann Robertson who hailed the performer.:Watch boy, , belt out Bohemian Rhapsody on Central Station pianoShe said: \"I love all music but my absolute fave song in the whole world is Nessun Dorma by Luciano Paotti.\"I hope I dont embarass this gentleman but he nailed this in Bar West tonight n should be proud.

Some young women suffered worse fates: an explosion killed one local girl, others lost arms and fingers or were severely burned due to the fires which could break out. Their work and leisure lives were strictly monitored: everything came under the official secrets act and over  members of the Womenrsquos Police Service monitored their movements and morals!The museum is set across two floors with interactive displays including films, games and oral testimonies of people from World War One and Two.

Amongst the animals they hunted were bears, which are now a strong emblem at Traquair.Traquair also played host to Mary Queen of Scots in  when she visited with her husband Darnley. Traquair still has the bed where she slept and the cradle where she rocked her baby, later James V of Scotland and I England.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Traquair House\",\"description\": \"Traquair House\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer thumbs ebYSWHp-.jpg\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests ebYSWHp.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": The Stuarts of Traquair have been in residence since  and the house remains a family home today.

In recent weeks, for background to a book Irsquom writing about Mary Queen of Scots ndash donrsquot yawn! ndash Irsquove been visiting some of the locations of her troubled years here. Despite a lelong interest in history, doubtless in part due to early brainwashing, I have been shamed to discover how much of the past there is, within easy reach, that Irsquove never bothered to seek out or explore.When it comes to ill-fated Mary, Historic Environment Scotland offers a guide to most of the key points in her tale, as found in old buildings and sites. Itrsquos a clever idea, pandering to an international fascination with her that never fades. Of all our prominent figures, not even Charles Edward Stuart has the abiding allure of this deeply tragic royal. Hence the number of visitors from Japan and America in Linlithgow Palace, where she was born, or the Germans photographing forbidding Hermitage Castle in the Borders, where she paid a fleeting visit to the wounded Earl of Bothwell, a trip that cost her dear.Yet what is immediately obvious is how few locals there are clambering up Dumbarton Rock, where she stayed for months as a child, before being whisked to safety in France, or on the woodland paths around the site of the Battle of Carberry Hill, where her fate was effectively sealed.Arguably the most important location, Dundrennan Abbey in Dumfries  Galloway, had no other visitors whatsoever while I was there at the weekend. It hardly appears to be on anyonersquos radar, even though in terms of Mary it is hugely symbolic, being the very last place she slept before leaving for England. When her boat reached Cumbria, from the tiny nearby port, she was to spend the rest of her le in captivity. There is far more to Dundrennan, however, than the memory of Maryrsquos passing. A tranquil haven, in lush countryside close to the sea, this th-century Cistercian abbey survived the wars of independence, though not the tumult of the Reformation. Above all, it is architecturally fascinating, showing the arrival of the gothic style in Scotland.The enchanting narrow and winding roads around here, and for that matter all across this un-sung region, were almost car free. Yoursquore more likely to encounter a milk tanker than a motorcycle. Put a grandfather clock in our back seat, and we could have been on The Antiques Roadshow, tootling through bucolic pastoral scenery, one foot firmly planted in yesteryear.The richness of history that lies all around us is staggering. Yet, either because of over-familiarity, complacency or lack of knowledge, it is half-forgotten or ignored. Even our glitziest period celebrity cannot draw crowds much beyond the central belt. Scotlandrsquos bygone affairs, you might say, do not have the magnetic pull of British history ndash ie, English ndash in whose shadow they have lain for as long as time has been measured.Population density and accessibility in part explain why English monuments and castles are crawling with tourists, whereas the wind whistles emptily through many of ours. Stonehenge, just off a convenient main road, attracts millions, whereas to visit the far eerier Callanish Stones on the isle of Lewis requires determination and planning. Nor could the ferry cope with a sudden surge in traffic.But therersquos more to it than that. Until fairly recently, our history was seen by those who shaped the curriculum, and the political agenda, as a branch of a bigger tree. Despite the profoundly influential impact of our royal dynasties across all these isles, and our complex, sophisticated political system, even today most of us are still probably better versed in Tudor kings and queens than in the equally colourful Stuarts.While we live in more enlightened times now, connecting with our past is as much our own responsibility as that of the educational or cultural establishment. Who cares whether British history gets more attention than Scottish, Welsh or Irish  The abundance of clues left by our forebears is a priceless record, a heritage written plain and loud as a redtop headline. We donrsquot need permission, or a professional go-between, to discover it for ourselves.School teachers are well aware that facts and dates rarely stick without something to bring them alive. Visit Scotland, and the past rises to meet you at every turn. Some of it lies beneath our feet, the bones of early civilisation, or the work of long-gone farmers, still visible ason an x-ray. Castles, forts, mines and harbours are all within easy reach of most of us. As scaremongers like to say of rats, yoursquore never more than a few feet from a fragment of history anywhere in this land.Indeed, therersquos so much of it you can understand why some people feel oppressed, fearing that to pay our national saga too much attention will hold us back. For me, though, the wealth of evidence is invigorating. Following in the footsteps of a figure such as Mary Queen of Scots is to feel an almost tangible connection. Rather than highlighting how far distant were the times in which she lived, it has the opposite effect. Listening to crows cawing on the rooftop of Linlithgow Palace, or the kittiwakes nesting on the ruins of Dunbar Castle looking out across Arthurrsquos Seat from Craigmillar Castle, or to the English coast from the beach near Dundrennan, is actually to sense that those who shaped our country were in most important respects not much dferent from us.As Irsquom belatedly learning, jaunts to castles and battle sites are a three-dimensional holiday, offering a perspective that reaches deep into the archives. Rather than encouraging nostalgia or sentiment, it is instead a bracing reminder of the urgent need to live in the here and now. Therersquos nothing like a ruin to show you how quickly time catches us all."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-time-focus-debate-high-costs-independence","story":"In my view it is testimony to the downright irresponsible coverage and shallow analysis of constitutional matters that none of these papers or politicians has pointed out that because of the tanking oil price the economics underpinning independence are far worse now than in  when oil was around  dollars a barrel today it is . Has anyone bothered to remind us that Scotland spends pound. billion more than it raises in taxes whilst the Scottish NHS costs around pound billion annually to run  No one has taken the time to tell us which taxes would increase and which welfare services would be cut and by how much to reduce this deficit.Again, in the rush to promote the break-up of the Union no one has bothered to discuss the minor irritant for Scots who have taken out their mortgages in sterling of the distinct possibility that their wages will be paid in a new Scottish currency which could be worth less than sterling. Do pensioners really want to take the risk of having their pensions paid in a new Scottish currency whilst the rest of the UK continue to receive theirs in sterling  It really is unbelievable that such important information is not even being discussed in this latest round of independence is just around the corner.The fact that independence is always discussed, stripped of its economic context, gives rise to the promotion of shallow but seductive tropes such as independence is the obvious alternative to a Johnson-led hard Brexit. But is it really  My hunch is that when people become aware of the turbo-charged austerity which would inevitably follow independence, that staying in the UK trumps a Johnson-led hard Brexit.Because of the appalling level of debate when it comes to constitutional issues the great worry is that the country could sleepwalk into independence. The crucial challenge for the majority who wish to remain in the UK is to recalibrate the independence debate to focus on the crucial economic consequences of independence that are never discussed: consequences such as how to pay off our fiscal deficit and our population shareof UK debt and how to find the pound billion to buy the currency reserves to fund a new currency to mention but a few.Robert Hoskins, Glasgow G.LIKE many who cannot accept our devolved power in Scotland and fancully believe all would be well with separation from the UK, Hugh Kerrseems to me to confuse personalities with policy.Having lived through  Prime ministers I can assure him that, to the public at least, politics is very often no more than a passing parade. Boris Johnson will come and go like the rest of them. If he attempts to behave presidentially he will doubtless meet the same fate as Margaret Thatcher.Although I personally feel that we have had to suffer the enervation imposed by the Tory Party elevating their court jester when our reserves were still depleted by Brexit, this is surely a time to keep the ship on an even keel.The ldquowake-up call advocated by Mr Kerr and targeted at the SNP is surely misdirected and as many would suggest, should be aimed at the Liberal Democrats. I consider that the Labour Party has, through self-inflicted errors of judgment, managed to make itself less likely to be elected into power than at any time since the Second World War.It is now for Jo Swinson, leader of the LibDems, to ldquodo a Boris and rally the troops while the Conservative party is still in conflict with itself. Not since  when Henry Campbell-Bannerman became Prime Minister for the Liberal Party has such an opportunity been presented.Bill Brown, Milngavie.CAST your mind back. The minute the result of the  Scottish independence referendum was announced, the SNP declared it was on the offensive. The minute the  Brexit referendum was announced, the SNP declared it was on the offensive. The minute Boris Johnsons premiership was announced, the SNP immediately declared itself on the offensive. All three events linked by the \" necessity\" for Scotland to go its own way.In these five years, Scotland has not done very well, but the important question is would it have been betterwe had split from England  The answer is resoundingly \"no\". The proof is the current state of Scotlands already-devolved powers and the numerous failures these have engendered. Saying that given all powers this would be so much better, is demonstrably wrong. The SNP is seeking any excuse to seize any half-chance to promote independence. That suggests desperation.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow G.IF there was ever a crystal-clear indication of the pathetic state of the Labour Party in Scotland it is surely the comments by Labour councillor Alex Gallagher .On the day when the United Kingdom has had possibly the worst Prime Minister ever forced upon it by an extreme right-wing element within the Tory Party how does this representative of the Labour Party react  He writes a letter criticising the First Minister. You really could not make it up. If Mr Gallagher genuinely cared about this \"United\" Kingdom his thoughts and actions should have been directed towards ways to counteract the little Englander policies which Boris Johnson espouses.Not only does this show that Labour is in a deep hole but it also tells us that Mr Gallagher and his cohorts just cant stop digging.David Stubley, Prestwick.LIKE him or not, Boris Johnson has the same charismatic charm and panache as Alex Salmond used to have with the people and Scottish folk will soon warm to him as a politician with real character.He has a very dficult ahead taking the UK out of Europe but he is the one politician who has the capability to deliver to the people what they actually voted for.Dennis Forbes Grattan, Aberdeen AB.THE village joker has been anointed the saviour of the nasty party. A Titanic moment for the UK Ian Lennie, Falkirk.IS the world destined to be governed by self-serving, childish oafs, lacking in social skills or any degree of statesmanship, sporting dodgy haircuts and putting their personal ambition before what is best for their countries I, of course, refer to The Donald and to Kim Jong-un, and not to anyone at Westminster or Holyrood.

The results, by authors including Darren McGarvey, Orwell Award-winning author of Poverty Safari, have a distinctly sci-fi feel but are all based on technologies with us now or coming soon. In the four vignettes, cash is a distant memory and roads are dominated by driverless transport. Deliveries are all done by drone and language has narrowed to a kind of universal speech recognised by AIs like Alexa.The Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce ndash to give it its Sunday name ndash might dispute that all four of the stories it has commissioned are dystopian.One by Orwell Prize winner Delia Jarrett-Macauley is designed to consider how automation could go hand in hand with responsible employment and a partnership with workers and unions. Nevertheless it is far from utopian .By confronting us with the possible outcomes of imminent technological advances, the RSA hopes to get us all thinking about what kind of use we want to put them to. We could, it says, ldquoagitate for a more socially just and egalitarian future for ourselves and our children.I approve of the sentiment. I just wonder how realistic it is. TVrsquos Black Mirror has already explored similar topics and I donrsquot see a huge degree of response ndash beyond a horried fascination at some of the scenarios suggested by the seriesrsquo writers.I think we generally feel pretty powerless to do much about a lot of this. Perhaps the most visible sign of technology making people redundant is at the automated supermarket which have all but wiped out a whole class of workers. Particularly committed shoppers may seek out real cashiers, where they are still available, but most of us have succumbed.Lots of people rail against the suspect domestic surveillance involved in owning AI devices like Echo and Echo Dot which may record some of your interactions and send them to Amazon bosses ndash but the company has sold more than  million of them.In some sectors, potential problems and solutions are being more vigorously debated. Take the ethical and practical questions raised by driverless cars.A recent survey by the Law Commissions of England and Scotland asked people to consider whether driverless cars should be allowed to lsquoinch throughrsquo areas crowded with pedestrians. A majority thought they should. But for that work they would need to be programmed to have some degree of credible threat of injury written into their code.And the Faculty of Advocates considered similar questions in February. ldquoPersons generally are entitled to expect that a self-driving vehicle will not collide with and injure them. However, in reality, the situation is much more nuanced their report said. If a vehicle had no option but to choose between striking a group of people in the road or a single inidual on the pavement, it might have to make that choice, the Faculty suggested. Personally I canrsquot see how this canrsquot ultimately result in the phasing out of the one truly unpredictable factor ndash human drivers.The general public, however, is not discussing any of this while ndash as the technology rushes ahead ndash car manufacturers and their lawyers and insurers seem primarily concerned about who will be liable when things do go wrong.It would be wrong to deny the upsides to all this. Robots and computer programmes could eventually carry out all the tedious, dirty or dangerous jobs humans dislike, freeing us up for fun tasks or more leisure time.

As we see wine companies moving their businesses online, robot people cold calling us and check-in for travel without interacting with a human being at all, this seems more convincing.So we distract ourselves with Love Island and hoverboarding Frenchmen.

My view then was that centre-right Scottish politics needed a great disruption. My relationship with political parties is not emotional rather it is entirely transactional. They are a means to an end a vehicle to construct a government. When that vehicle is sitting in a ditch, written off, the sensible thing to do is to get a hold of a new vehicle rather than trying to jump into the wreckage and make it go.Eight years have passed, and I have three core reflections. The first is that Ruth Davidson has been a very accomplished and successful leader of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, but should would have been an iconic, generationally memorable leader of the party that her opponent wanted to create. Let us remember that Ruth Davidson consistently beats Nicola Sturgeon in head-to-head approval ratings, but her party, a ball and chain to her, can only muster a little over half of the SNPrsquos percentage.My second reflection is that, with my hands held up, I now realise that our proposal would not have worked. It was as radical as we thought the members could handle, but with hindsight, not enough.:SNP say Ruth Davidson lsquohumiliatedrsquo after David Mundell sacked against her adviceA party explicitly formed to take the whip of the Tories at Westminster would have been easily caricatured as Tories in all but name, and perhaps with some justication. Rather than a CDU CSU type of model, what I would now propose is a Canadian model, whereby the Conservative party stands in Scotland at Westminster, but a new, separate, unconnected and unrelated party stands at Holyrood. As well as creating the conditions for a governing party at Holyrood, it would assuage those Tories at Westminster who felt that taking the Tories out of Scotland entirely is lsquoun-unionistrsquo.My final reflection is that, although I thought at the time that this was a problem confined to the Conservative party, I now realise it is not. The SNPrsquos success over the last  years has been predicated on exploiting the  v  mentality wersquore Scotlandrsquos party, and theyrsquore Londonrsquos parties in Scotland. The Scottish Tories are buffeted by the winds of Westminster, for sure, but they are not alone.The Lib Demsrsquo woes following the coalition years were felt in  at Westminster, but also  and  at Holyrood. Labourrsquos calamitous uncertainty over Brexit, and its anti-Semitism crisis, are savaging its polling numbers in Scotland it came th with less than  per cent of the vote in the European Parliament elections. The Canadian model is one which all parties should observe and act upon.Since  the concept of a separate Scottish party has come and gone. If we charted its progress, it would be very obvious to see that its stock increases in times where the Tory party at Westminster is in trouble, and decreases at times when the mothership is doing well. In the immediate aftermath of Davidsonrsquos victory, the idea went back into its box.The independence referendum came at a perfect time, as it gave Davidson something to hold on to. She did so with efficiency and vigour, becoming the head of unionism in Scotland and, critically, keeping the issue firmly on the table during the  Scottish Parliament elections and the  Westminster General Election Sturgeon does.But as sure as night follows day, when you run downwind at times of relative calm at Westminster, you are going to have to turn around and run with it in your face. Brexit has produced a stf headwind for the Scottish Tories, and the inability of the Westminster government to deliver it has cost the Scottish party at least five points, so far, in the polls.Enter Boris Johnson, and now it is blowing a gale. The Scottish Tories saw this coming. Last year, they ran a clandestine campaign codenamed Operation Arse, aimed at persuading MPs to prevent Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister. The driver was the partyrsquos internal polling it showed Johnson to be unpopular across all Tory voters ndash the core,  switchers and  switchers. He was the least popular of all known leadership candidates at that time. His favourability was - at a time when Theresa Mayrsquos was still +, and Davidsonrsquos +.Operation Arse has failed. And, to make matters worse, Davidsonrsquos ally David Mundell has been sacked, leaving her spitting tacks. So, what now  I suspect that Davidson will do and say very little publicly between now and late-August. She will then re-convene her MSPs and that will be, to borrow a phrase, do or die.:SNP mavericks try to revive independence Plan BUltimately, this is about . Talk used to be of emerging from that election as the largest party. It is now of winning enough seats to stop an SNP Green majority and the second independence referendum that will have to follow to avoid a democratic outrage. It may yet be an issue of simply retaining enough MSPs to be relevant.The question for Ruth Davidson is how to maximise her vote in . It is likely to have only one answer. Boris Johnson is exactly the sort of Tory Nicola Sturgeon wants in Downing Street - a posh, rich, southern Tory who led the Leave campaign and has a streak of English nationalism running through him.But therersquos something Nicola Sturgeon doesnrsquot want. Decentralisation. She doesnrsquot want Boris Johnson to create a quasi-federal arrangement whereby the Scottish Parliament is offered all the powers that most peoplewant. And she doesnrsquot want Ruth Davidson to create a new party which can argue from a Scotland first perspective, with no ties to the Tories.Davidson and Johnson donrsquot agree on much. But they should agree on this."},{"url":null,"title":"trans-rights-questions-yaniv-male-genitals-waxing-case-must-answered-scotland","story":"Concerns frequently pooh-poohed as misleading nonsense, the sort of scaremongering that never happens in real le. Unfortunately - for all concerned - fears have been realised.A trans woman, Jessica Yaniv, approached a number of female beauticians to ask for a Brazilian bikini wax, all - perhaps by coincidence - were lone home workers, the majority of whom were immigrant women.Unfortunately, Ms Yaniv was unable to find any beautician willing to carry out the intimate wax because she still retains male genitalia and each of these women only worked on female genitalia.:Are you trans  Next Scottish census to ask questions on gender IDMs Yaniv, a trans rights campaigner, then raised action against  of the women at British Columbiarsquos human rights tribunal, alleging discrimination and seeking damages of several thousanddollars from each.It was too much for several of the women to fight and so they folded their businesses instead, losing their livelihoods.The case cleaves opinion in two: either it is discriminatory of the beauticians to refuse to wax a trans womans genitals regardless of what they look like, or it is discriminatory to force a woman to handle male genitals against her will.The tribunal will make a decision - and that decision may well be to disregard womens boundaries and dignity by finding for Ms Yaniv and asserting that the law believes it is discrimination for women to refuse to touch a penis when that penis belongs to a trans woman.Ms Yaniv has posted deeply troubling comments on social media about young girls, although she claimed at the tribunal her account was hacked. There are those who would say she is vexatious and should be disregarded. Fiona Robertson, the SNPs National Womens and Equalities Convener, says Ms Yaniv is a female predator and that women predators often use their womanliness to gain access to victims.Critics of Ms Robertsons stance would strongly dispute male predatory behaviour being attributed to women.I would not dream of speaking for trans people but Im going to take a stab that the vast majority just want to get on with their lives peaceably and,asked about the Yaniv case, would be of the \"not in my name\" persuasion. Trans people cannot want this sort of legal action either, yet activists and allies have remained silent on the case.However, it cant be ignored and certainly not by a Scotland where there is a bitter ide between trans allies and, for want of a better shorthand, womens allies.Trans woman are women has become a political slogan in support of self ID and of respecting the rights of trans people but to take it to its conclusion is to fundamentally redefine the word \"woman\" and remove the element of sex from the words definition.The argument from some feminists is that the introduction of self ID is the beginning of a creep towards removing womens sex-based rights.Currently \"sex\" is a protected characteristic and so, for example, womens refuges have the right to refuse to house male-bodied people or, indeed, employ male-bodied people.Jo Swinson, the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, has been highly vocal in declaring that trans women are women but less clear in defining exactly what she means. If it is the Liberal Democrats stance that trans women are literally women then it suggests the Liberal Democrats would support the removal of the sex-based exemption.To avoid Yaniv-style legal cases, the Scottish Government must be explicit in how the Equality Act will apply to any new law.But explicit answers to troubling questions are exactly what this public conversation is lacking and no wonder when you have an MSP, Mhairi Black, calling women who disagree with self ID \"Jeremy Hunts\", a rhyming slang it takes no genius to work out.The Scottish Government already confuses \"sex\" with \"gender\" in its consultation on self ID. Pro-self ID campaigners have pointed to the reassurance that there will be the protection of up to two years prison term for those who abuse self ID. Butyou cannot define \"woman\", how can you legislate effectively to determine who is or isnt really living as a woman : years of Stonewall: The fight for LGBT rightsIn Canada too, a woman has reported to the human rights tribunal that a womans shelter for recovering addicts made her homeless because she refused to share a twin room with a trans woman. The woman was a rape victim and felt frightened at being in close quarters with a male-bodied person who was \"masc presenting\", that is, maintained a beard and wore typically masculine clothes.There was no suitable alternative space in the refuge and so the woman was asked to leave. This is another scenario women have raised questions about but been given no clear answers.Scottish Womens Aid and Rape Crisis have both made statements saying they are in support of self ID. Rape Crisis also supports men so its no surprise the charity supports trans people - it would be an odd developmentthey did not.Scottish Womens Aid, the umbrella organisation for womens aid groups in Scotland, focuses on policy and research, it does not run refuges and so, while it supports self ID and takes a clear line that domestic abuse affects trans women too, its position is largely academic in that it will not have to deal with the frontline practicalities of balancing rights.Inidual womens aid charities in Scotland have gone on public record to say they have real concerns about self-ID.Wouldnt it be useful, instead of sloganeering and calling women c****, for politicians and charities to give explicit, detailed answers to questions being asked  The only way to allay fears is to tackle them head-on.Women are told their boundaries are not under threat - the Yaniv case contradicts this. They are told there is no conflict when it comes to women-only spaces such as refuges, they are told men will not pose as trans women to gain access to womens spaces - there are multiple cases in Canada of this happening.It will only help the debate to progressquestions raised in Canada are answered in Scotland - for the benefit of everyone."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-anyone-lady-windermere-39-s-fan","story":"ONE of the hottest days in Britain yesterday.

Itrsquos still a very holy isle.Whatrsquos Harry Potter got to do with it Some headlines have referred to the boy wizard because Loch Shiel features as the Black Lake in the Harry Potter movies and the isle is by Glenfinnan, where filming for the second and third Harry Potter movies took place, with Glenfinnan Viaduct making a star appearance on the silver screen.How signicant is the loss of the bell Scottish culture and heritage historian Professor Hugh Cheape described it as a ldquohorrible catastrophe, adding: ldquoI have thought a lot about St Finan over the years and how he took on leprosy as a penance.\"He would have sailed up Loch Shiel with only his hand bell and a staff as the early Christian saints did. I canrsquot put myself in the mind of someone who would take it.The bell is cursed Mr Cheape has warned the culprit could indeed be in danger. He said of the bell: ldquoItrsquos known to be cursed. One of the Government soldiers after the  rebellion went off with it to Fort William, where the bell turned round, beat him up then flew back to St Finanrsquos isle with the villagers hearing it clanking through the air.Police inquiries are ongoing.A Police Scotland spokesman said: \"The bell was removed from the uninhabited island sometime between late June and early July.

This is a lady so socially enlightened that until  she supported restoration of the death penalty. She has voted in favour of repealing the Human Rights Act, is in favour of reducing welfare payments to the terminally ill, sick and the disabled. However, most egregiously she was dismissed as Secretary of State for International Development when she was found to have held numerous meetings with Israeli government officials to discuss official business without informing the Foreign Office, a clear breach of the Ministerial Code. Some law and order appointment, Mr Johnson.But even more worrying are two aspects of Mr Johnsonrsquos speech on arrival at  Downing Street. First, that he is already lining up for blame anyone who does not share his views or is unwilling to come along on the journey he proposes to take us on. Those of us who hold genuine concerns, our own legitimate disagreements and certainly anyone who gives voice to our criticism, will be blamed as ldquothe doubters, the doomsters and the gloomsters. Who knows what is next  Fth columnists Secondly, we will not be the only targets of Mr Johnsonrsquos blame claims. The EU itself is being lined up. He delineated his position with regard to the backstop in just one phrase ndash ldquowe refuse under any circumstances to have such checks and yet without that anti-democratic backstop. Andthe Europeans refuse to go along with this, ldquowe are forced to come out with no deal. Thus, on the one hand the European Union is presented with a diktat, and on the other hand will be responsible because they would not lsquoobey his diktat. My way or the highway, Michel Barnier.There will certainly be little sign of opposition in Cabinet as such as the Foreign Office , Treasury , Education , Business , Commons Leader , Duchy of Lancaster , and our own new Secretary of State , have all been either enthusiastic Leavers all along, or made clear they would now countenance leaving the EU without a deal. Johnsonrsquos might have been the ldquothe bloodiest cull of a Cabinet in modern political history, but it has allowed him to surround himself with minions who will do his bidding.A Prime Minister lining up the targets for blame when he fails, before he even goes through the door of No  supported by the uncritically like-minded. All in the first few hours. What could go wrong Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WHEN Winston Churchill became Prime Minister, at an even more desperate time for our country, he famously said: \"Power, for the sake of lording it over fellow creatures or adding to personal pomp is rightly deemed base, but power in a national crisis, when a man believes he knows what orders should be given, is a blessing.\" So far, Boris Johnson behaves ashe is seeking power, specically the top job, for its own sake.We have yet to seehe really knows what orders to give, as distinct from blind belief in his own ability. More worryingly, Churchill had the honesty to face the nation with the truth, the need for blood, toil, tears and sweat instead our new Prime Minister offers a pain-free Brexit, jam today and still more jam tomorrow.Peter MD Gray, Aberdeen AB.MANY years ago, when Boris Johnson was a cub reporter for an English broadsheet, he wrote an article concerning an archaeological find on the south bank of the River Thames of a house built in the mid-s for Edward II, wherein he was to enjoy a le \"of wine and song\" with his favourite, Piers Gaveston. Of course, said favouritehad got his head cut off in . Now, Edward may have been a strange man but I sincerely doubt he was that strange.The moral of this tale is, of course, that Mr Johnson does not \"do detail\".Hence what happens now depends largely upon the quality of his advisors.Brian D Finch, Glasgow G.FEW Prime Ministers,any, can have entered  Downing Street with such a mendacious, arrogant, libidinous past. What on earth has Great Britain come to  Heartily endorsed by President Donald Trump as Britainrsquos Trump, his position is secure. But requesting America for assistance to protect shipping in the Strait of Hormuz received the answer that we should look after our own ships and we have now formally requested Europe for a European-led mission to protect Gulf shipping.If Mr Johnson manages to fulfil his ambition to drag us out of the EU on October  then we will not be, as he has said, a ldquoslumbering giant but rather an insignicant, small island stranded in the Atlantic convenient to the United States as a remote aircraft carrier ndash USS Great Britain. We now have trade agreements with Chile, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Antigua, Bahamas, Guyana, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and sundry others but after three years there are still more than  countries to go and that includes the really important ones.What an exciting prospect.Nigel Dewar Gibb, Glasgow G.I FIND an unexpected spring in my stride. I whistle a happy tune, crying out What-Ho! and Huzzah! as I look forward to the veritable feast anticipated on Halloween. Shrink-wrapped kippers chlorine-washed chicken and best of all, nourishing full fibre broadband, all washed down with a sugary milk-shake. Whats not to like Must dust down that catchy tune that was on everyones lips in . How did it go: \"Things can only get better\". Aye, right ndash far right, too.Graeme Orr, Neilston.WOULD that the Tory rump had someone of the calibre of Bertie Wooster to turn to . Not only is he of irreproachable moral probity and possessed of a command of English as impressive as his acuity of observations, but he has the sense and humility to delegate the resolution of apparently insoluble problems to someone who, without seeking either adulation or material advantage, can be relied upon to ldquoendeavour to give satisfaction.A better comparison to Boris Johnson would be the generally odious Spode ndash or perhaps best of all ndash the pathologically self-centred Lord Dunstable.Robin Dow, Rothesay."},{"url":null,"title":"doug-marr-teachers-run-schools-39-football","story":"The ,-dollar question is why we no longer produce international standard players. Not too long ago there was a regular debate about whether Jim Baxter and Denis Law could be accommodated in the same Scotland team. I once asked Denishe and Baxter could play together for Scotland. His eyes twinkled as he replied, ldquoProbably not, wersquore both in our fties now.The one bright spot is girlsrsquo and womenrsquos football. The relative success of the womenrsquos game is largely due to the increased numbers of girls playing from an early age. Schools deserve some of the credit. In my neck of the woods, Mintlaw Academy was on the ball, winning the national girlsrsquo senior trophy on five occasions. Arsenal and Scotlandrsquos Kim Little is only one of the Mintlaw alumni who has gone on to greater things.In contrast, boysrsquo participation has stagnated. Much of that stems from the decline in schoolsrsquo football, especially at secondary. As a teacher in the s, our school fielded five or six teams every Saturday. There was a waiting list for teachers to manage the teams. Despite lacking both a playing field and formal coaching qualications, we produced a host of professionals, a few internationals and the scorer of the winner in a European final.Those days are gone for good. Teachers have discovered the golf course and BQ. The decline of schoolsrsquo football is not due to a lack of facilities. I once asked the head of a new school why the all-weather pitch was deserted at break times. I despaired when told it was ldquohealth and safety.Football may not be a matter of le and death, butitrsquos our highest profile national sport, success contributes to our collective feel-good factor. We need to get our young people, especially boys, playing again in much greater numbers. We have a captive audience in schools with first-class facilities. The missing pieces are the modern equivalents of the hundreds of teachers who willingly gave of their time and sorely missed inter school competition.Successive SFAndashdriven strategies have brought no perceptible improvement at club or national levels.

But this does not trigger changes in funding for England or the other regions.: Boris Johnson under pressure over attacks on Scotlands public spendingOf all the regions, Northern Ireland received the most spending per head , followed by Scotland , Walesand England .The report has recommended that at future spending reviews, the Treasury should publish more detailed and transparent information about its funding decisions and explain how it has ensured that funding decisions are prioritised according to the needs of citizens across the UK.\"This should include evidence of its assessment that the current block grant continues to be the optimum way of allocating funding to meet the needs of the UK as a whole,\" the report recommends.The committee has also recommended that the Treasury should write to it with analysis of the funding and share \"timely information\" with the devolved regions.: Boris Johnson accused of dubious u-turn after backing Barnett Formula after previous criticismA Scottish Government spokesman said: \"This report makes clear that the UK Governments decisions on devolved funding are not transparent and we have no clarity on the impact of spending announcements until the Treasury decides where the money will come from.\"The Scottish Government is no further forward than we were three months ago in knowingthere will be a UK Spending Review in  and it is crucial that the UK Government confirms its intentions so all devolved administrations have clarity.\"An HM Treasury spokesman said: \"We will consider the findings of this report.\"We are very transparent about the amount of funding we provide for the devolved administrations -

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr Lyon said HIAL is fully prepared for three days of industrial action, which will see six of its airports closed due to strike action by air traffic controllers.Kirkwall Airport will be shut to all traffic next Monday, July .The strikes were called following the rejection of HIAL’s latest offer on July . The offer rejected by Air Traffic Controllerscomprised a retention allowance that would have seen ATCOs benefit from an additional £, over a five-year period.Prospect presented a counter offer that signicantly exceeds the flexibility and affordability of a publicly owned organisation.HIAL says that, throughout this process, it has been committed to resolving this dispute and has submitted a number of proposals that have been rejected outright by the union.Inglis Lyon, HIAL’s Managing Director said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience and upset to hundreds of passengers affected by the strike action.  We wish to find a resolution to this dispute as soon as possible and would urge Prospect to sit down with us once again to find some common ground on which we can arrive at a negotiated settlement.“Our position has been consistent throughout. We can only deliver an affordable settlement within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy.

Shetland football matches for the Milne Cup dating back to Jockie Wood£ . tax incl.One Hundred Glorious Games is the title chosen to describe the milestone just reached in the annual football fixture between teams representing Orkney and Shetland. But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football. And make up your own mind about the glorious bits!Jockie WoodNo customer reviews for the moment.* Required fields"},{"url":null,"title":"stromness shopping week in full swing  \n","story":"newsStromness Shopping Week in full swingJuly ,  at : pm##A sandcastle competition entertained young children.This castle paid tribute to Shopping Week with its bunting.Alannah Moar enchanted the crowd when she performed at the Town House Garden.A pavement artist competition at the Pier Arts Centre attracted budding young artists.Despite a damp start to Stromness Shopping Week on Monday, during its official opening ceremony, crowds have been turning out to enjoy all that the annual week of events has to offer.The town enjoyed a scorcher of a day yesterday, with a selection of events including pavement art and sandcastle building.

Five months on, with no progress having been made, I want to challenge Mr Kerr to put his country and his constituency above party and back another referendum on Brexit. In the  referendum,  per cent of voters in Stirling backed Remain, higher than the  per cent figure in Scotland as a whole. Despite this, Mr Kerr’s team told me he would continue to facilitate Brexit. They argued that in  he was elected on a Conservative party manesto that promised to “respect the referendum”. I understand this.Yet, circumstances have changed. With any form of ‘sensible’ Brexit deal being blown out the water, it looks like the Conservative party is going to attempt to enforce the hardest possible Brexit upon Remain-voting Stirling. I am sure Mr Kerr has seen the recent YouGov survey revealing that Conservative members are willing to endure the collapse of the party itself, an economic crash and even the break-up of the UK in order to secure Brexit.: Brexit fears for sterling spark sharp warning to traders: Why it looks like Boris Johnson is planning to destroy Brexit Party – John McLellanI now find myself asking, where are the Scottish Conservatives in all of this  Are they happy to sit back and witness this collective loss of rationality and support the ‘Brexit-at-any-cost’ mentality that has gripped both their party and large parts of the UK This kamikaze approach would perhaps be understandablethe end result was something worth having. Yet a no-deal Brexit, which appears to be all but government policy, would be devastating for Scottish industry. For example, the drinks giant Diageo has already announced shts of production out of Scotland to the EU. This month, Deutsche Bank announced it is cutting jobs across the UK, having previously said it would move assets from London to Frankfurt because of Brexit. And the Scottish National Farmers Union has just raised serious concerns on behalf of its members about how lower food safety standards could put farmers livelihoods at risk. Is this what Stephen Kerr and the Scottish Conservatives would be happy to sacrice Finally, and most importantly for the Conservative and Unionist Party, polls in recent weeks highlighted that Scots would vote for independenceBoris Johnson became the next UK Prime Minister. With Tuesday’s announcement rendering this horror story a reality, an independent Scotland appears increasingly likely. Scots will not accept a botched deal by Boris or a cataclysmal no-deal Brexit. The Scottish Conservatives are very proud to call themselves the unionist party of Scotland. Surely, they are not so committed to any form of Brexit that they will put their party’s raison d’être in existential danger I understand Mr Kerr’s hesitancy about any form of a People’s Vote or confirmatory referendum as he feels he was elected on a manesto that promised not to offer this.However, I cannot understand how on Earth the Scottish Conservatives can continue to facilitate a disastrous Brexit that will be hugely damaging to Scotland’s economy and risks breaking up the union they are so proud of. Therefore, I ask, on behalf of young people in Scotland, who voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU, to at the very least publicly state your opposition to a destructive no-deal Brexit.Ailie Ross-Oliver is a campaigner with the Our Future Our Choice group©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn says pm has no plan to fix uk and demands general election","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Jeremy Corbyn has called for a general election as he claimed new Prime Minister Boris Johnson has \"no plan\" to tackle Britains problems.The Labour leader claimed the new Conservative Government has \"the most hard right-wing Cabinet I have ever seen\".He was speaking to cheering supporters at a rally in Parliament Square in London on Thursday - Mr Johnsons first full day in office.Mr Corbyn said: \"In reality the vote we need is the vote of the people, both to reject Brexit and to elect a Labour government for the future.\"For all the arm-waving bluster of the Prime Minister this morning, what came out of it very, very clearly is this: There is no plan to deal with Brexit, there is no plan to deal with the crisis in public services all across Britain.\"There is no plan to deal with the climate emergency that this country and our planet absolutely faces.\"He claimed the new Government believes in tax giveaways for the richest members of society and the big corporations.He dismissed the idea of special trade deals with the US, saying President Donald Trump is \"totally about\" America first.He also said: \"Despite his denials today I firmly believe the US administration would insist on access to our health market, as they call it, in reality it is our NHS.\"He urged people to register to vote and praised grassroots activists for the work they do in spreading Labours message.He also launched a series of pledges to the countryLabour wins the next general election, including increased funding for the NHS, a real living wage of £ an hour, and no increase in income tax or national insurance for % of people.There were also promises of a green industrial revolution, free school meals for primary school children, as well as a vow to keep the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes for pensioners.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"letters why does nicola sturgeon refuse to respect the 2014 indyref vote","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Scots made a decision on independence in , why does Nicola Sturgeon not respect the vote result, a Scotsman reader writes.In her letter to Boris Johnson, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says: “The right of the people of Scotland to determine their own future is a basic democratic principle that must be respected.” : Nicola Sturgeon writes to Boris Johnson: ‘We will give Scotland independence choice’For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here\u2028The people exercised this right in  and determined that we should stay within the United Kingdom.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great.

I think it’s something that doesn’t come along often so close to home. You might see an advert for one of the concert halls in Belfast for Moya, but to have it on our own doorstep here is brilliant.

At such a critical juncture, we need someone who is detail focused and sensitive to the complexity of the challenges ahead. In short, we need a statesman, not a showman.“Boris Johnson’s road to the Conservative Party leadership has been paved with destructive half-truths, bluster and outright lies, many of which helped precipitate the crisis from which he is now personally benefiting. With an impending no-deal Brexit and the stark choices facing us, we need substantive answers from him to what are incredibly serious and complex questions.“To date he has failed to demonstrate any real understanding of the needs of Northern Ireland, particularly in the context of Brexit and especially in a no deal scenario # needs that require more than merely a can-do attitude to resolve.“The Irish border is a delicate and nuanced issue, with resonance far beyond trading arrangements and with the potential to unpick the fabric of the Good Friday Agreementmishandled. It is also impacting on the ability of parties to restore the political institutions here. He now needs to demonstrate his ability to act with sensitivity and impartiality in his engagements with local parties.“It#s time to cut the bluff, bluster and bombastic rhetoric and start to provide the kind of reassurance business and civic society needs. Whilst I remain sceptical he will do that, I wish him well and will be more than happy to be proved wrong.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories.

They have provided assurances that she will not be disadvantaged as a result of losing out on the experience of acting up nor will she be victimised in any way. The Board has also committed to liaising with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, head of legal services at the Equality Commission, welcomed the result. \"This is a good result all round,\" she said. \"One of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change.\"While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future. \"Its good that this has been resolved productively and amicably.\"Ms McKernan said the case should serve as a reminder to employers of the need to treat staff fairly. \"Were publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part-time working arrangements, even unintentionally,\" she said.The legal expert pointed out that % of female employees work part-time in NI compared to % of male workers.Women make up % of part-time employees here. \"Because of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women,\" Ms McKernan explained. \"Thats why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination.\" Ms McCormick, who will continue teaching at the grammar school, also welcomed the outcome which she believes has led to positive change. \"I love my job and am happy at the school,\" she said. \"So Im pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with in a formal and procedurally correct manner.\""},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthThe OpenNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon. Karen Patterson will provide a fluent French translation for European visitors.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

He was three weeks in hospital but we are glad we did it.ldquoDespite all of what Matthew has gone through, he is never seen without a smile on his face. He is the most lovable, happy and determined boy.It was during Matthewrsquos recovery in hospital that Louise learnt about Swim Labrsquos water-based physio technique from another mum.She first took him to a programme in Lanzarote in March but has since took him to Swim Lab programme in Fivemiletown last month. He will be ing in September and December.Louise added: ldquoWe have exercises and activities to do with him every day which I video and send to the instructors to view and they then set other exercises so the work continues between the sessions.ldquoMatthew is doing things like riding a pony which he enjoys, but he doesnrsquot realise that this is helping strengthen his core muscles while he is doing it.The next local fundraising event is a charity golf day and barbeque at Bright Castle Golf Club on Saturday, August .To donate please visit www.gofundme f matthews-wish-to-walk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down Rally has surprise winner  ","story":"REIGNING World Rally Esports champion Jon Armstrong secured victory at a sensational Carryduff Forklt Down Rally, which was round four of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Stage Rally Championship.Armstrong and co-driver Noel OrsquoSullivan mirrored some of his success in the virtual gaming world by taking victory aboard a McGeehan Motorsport prepared Mini WRC at the event which was jointly organised by Ballynahinch and District Motor Club as well as Rathfriland Motor Club.It was his first time driving a World Rally car competitively and after using the opening miles to settle Armstrong quickly became a major contender.He was fourth overall after the tricky opening stage before climbing to third after setting the fastest time through stage two.He was gradually building his pace and looked set to challenge for the lead during the second loop of stages when he got a puncture during the fourth stage. The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking.

Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives. Shane Mulholland, senior vice president of marketing and operations at First Derivatives, said: “We’ve been involved with the Fast  programme since it began and have found it to be not only great recognition of every stage of the company’s growth but also a chance to meet peers and like-minded businesses who are striving to be leaders in their own fields.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/brexit_123234324234_web.jpg","title":"no deal brexit could cost ni  jobs","story":"Posted on Wednesday  July  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland faces losing , jobs in a ‘no deal’ Brexit which could have ‘immediate and severe consequences for its position as an all-island and UK economy, a government paper has warned.

Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
