It’s the way older homeowners can boost their finances and help turn their lives around in retirement. It’s called equity release. And if you’re over 55 then it could work for you. Here are the SEVEN key facts every homeowner aged 55 and over should know... ONE: It’s all about releasing tax-free cash tied up in the value of your home While some people choose to downsize, many are retiring and finding their homes are worth more than their pension funds. Equity release lets you access the money in your home, just like turning 55 lets you access the cash in your pension. The money you release from your home is tax-free and you can spend it however you like.  Even if you have an outstanding mortgage, you can still take out equity release, as long as you pay off any debt secured against your property.  You can use some or all of the funds released to do this.          If you retire and find your home is worth more than your pension fund, equity release can helpTWO: It’s a simple process The most common way is to take out a lifetime mortgage which is a loan secured against your home, but unlike a traditional mortgage there are typically no monthly payments, allowing you to get on with enjoying your retirement.The loan plus roll-up interest is repaid when your equity release plan ends. This is normally when you or your surviving spouse pass away or go into long term care.As straightforward as it sounds, seeking the advice of a leading independent broker like Key Equity Release is crucial to help find a plan that meets your needs. They will also encourage you to involve your closest family so that everyone understands and is involved in the decision. They will explain how it will reduce the value of your estate and may affect your entitlement to means tested benefits – your expert equity release adviser will help you understand any implications specific to your inidual circumstances.            Organising equity release is a simple process, but talk it through with your grown up childrenTHREE: You will still own your homeWith a lifetime mortgage you always own your own home. Plans approved by the Equity Release Council, which Key recommends, offer a cast iron guarantee that you can stay in your home until the plan comes to an end and you can never owe more than your home is worth – so there’s no need to worry about house prices or how much interest builds up.          With a lifetime mortgage you will still own your home - all you\u0027ve done is take out a new loan on itFOUR: The amount you can raise will varyHow much cash you can release with an equity release plan will depend on things such as the value of your home, your age and health. At the time of writing an example from industry expert Key says a 65-year-old in good health could release up to 36 per cent of the value of his or her home. A healthy 80-year-old could release up to 52 per cent. In fact, last year Key enabled their customers to access an average of £86k of tax-free cash from their home. FIVE: You can use the money for anything you wantMany people use the money they release to clear outstanding credit card debts or interest only mortgages – but equally, lots of people use it for life\u0027s luxuries, such as holidays or new cars. A large percentage of people alternatively use it for home improvements, often \u0027future proofing\u0027 their family home with a new en-suite or a downstairs bathroom for the years ahead. Some use the money to help their children or grandchildren pay for homes or education. It\u0027s entirely up to you.Of course, it is always important to remember when releasing equity that you balance current needs with future wants and you should always think carefully before securing a loan against your home.       "},{"url":null,"title":"Seven metrics prove world better longer life poverty better health outcomes","story":"    The worldwide distribution of wealth has become more equitable since 1800, when much of the world lived on less than $2 a dayWhile income inequality in the U.S. continues to grow,  the worldwide distribution of wealth has become more equitable since 1800, when much of the world lived on less than $2 a day. Over the past 20 years, the proportion of people in the world who are living in extreme poverty has been cut in half.\u0027This is absolutely revolutionary,\u0027 Rosling writes in \u0027Factfulness.\u0027 \u0027I consider it to be the most important change that has happened in the world in my lifetime.\u0027 However, when Rosling and his team polled Americans, only 5 percent were able to correctly identify how the proportion of people living in poverty has changed in recent decades.Rosling maintained that it was just one of many widespread, negative misconceptions that we hold about the world – which Rosling called an \u0027overdramatic worldview.\u0027\u0027In fact, the vast majority of the world\u0027s population lives somewhere in the middle of the income scale,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027Perhaps they are not what we think of as middle class, but they are not living in extreme poverty. Their girls go to school, their children get vaccinated, they live in two-child families and they want to go abroad on holiday, not as refugees.\u0027 2. Life expectancy is higher across the globe than ever before Life expectancy across Europe during the Industrial Revolution hovered around 35 years – a number likely held down by high infant and child mortality rates, widespread disease in the pre-antibiotics era and  high rates of women dying in childbirth.Now life expectancy worldwide is nearly 72 years – an astounding achievement of modern medicine. In the Americas alone it  reached 76.9 by 2015.Rosling attributed the longer life expectancies to the fact that \u0027basic modernizations have reached most people and improved their lives drastically. They have plastic bags to store and transport food. They have plastic buckets to carry water and soap to kill germs.\u0027 3. Worldwide child mortality rates have dropped significantly Child mortality rates have also fallen steadily over the past century, reaching a low in 2015 of 4.5 percent of children around the globe dying before age 5. Compare that to 1950 when more than 22 percent of the world\u0027s children died before age 5. Even in the U.S. that number was 19.7 percent in 1950.Again, the contributions of modern medicine and improved public safety has helped eliminate many common causes of infant and child mortality.\u0027A lot of what went right was public health interventions,\u0027 Roser told DailyMail.com. \u0027The water supply today is much safer, has less pathogens that vulnerable children can succumb to and another big public health intervention is vaccinations. A lot of the diseases which previously killed millions of children were ones for which we developed vaccines.\u0027   \u0027It\u0027s also just an improvement in overall living conditions,\u0027 added Roser, whose work parallels Rosling\u0027s. \u0027The fact that people are much better nourished, that education has improved and people have a better understanding of how to ensure their children stay healthy, (and they have) better housing conditions.\u0027 4. Overpopulation is not going to be a problem anytime soon Those worried about overpopulation may be happy to learn that fertility rates are falling worldwide, down to an average of 2.49 children per woman in 2015 compared to of 5.5 children per woman in 1950. The U.S. alone is down from 3.58 children in 1958 to  1.91 children in 2011.\u0027We definitely know this population growth is coming to an end because the number of children born in the world is close to its peak already and the number of children born per women has halved,\u0027 Roser said.  Much of the decrease in fertility rates is linked to improving conditions for women around the world, he added. Across the tracks: Where a child lives in America - often...Share this articleAs women gain educations, footing in the workforce and access to birth control, they are able to  determine for themselves if \u0027they prefer that life to having seven children at home,\u0027 Roser said. The fertility numbers are also connected to the decrease in child morbidity - when fewer children are expected to die young, women don\u0027t need to have as many children to ensure that at least one child survives.  5. Global economies have been growing, driving up income levelsAt the same time, the Gross Domestic Product (the value of all goods and services produced in a country) in developed nations has been growing by roughly 2 percent a year for the past 150 years – causing income levels to approximately double every 36 years.The GDP ebbs and flows with the economy, taking dips during recessions and the Great Depression, but overall its growth rate has been a constant in the west.Ultimately the rise in incomes and in GDP per capita are like the metaphorical chicken and egg. While a rising GDP pushes up incomes, so too, do rising incomes drive GDP by providing more disposable income for citizens of a country to spend on its goods. Meanwhile, countries with lower incomes, such as China and India, have been growing at even faster rates during the past several decades and are beginning to catch up to Europe and America. In addition, Roser says the poorer, less-advanced countries have benefited from the technologies and innovations of the developed world - affecting everything from nutrition to vaccinations, or even large-scale manufacturing efficiencies. 6. Worldwide, fewer people live under authoritarian governments In other good news, more people around the world – some 55.8 percent – are living in Democracies than any other time in human history, Rosling noted. That\u0027s compared to 31.4 percent in 1950.As of 2015, just 23.23 percent of the world\u0027s population lived in an autocracy – a system of government in which one person holds absolute power – and 90 percent of them are in China. Compare that to 1980 when 43.6 percent of the world lived under an autocracy.Roser attributes this in part to the rapid information sharing now possible through the news and social media. As a society becomes more educated and has greater access to information about how its leaders are managing (or mismanaging) their country, citizens become empowered to push back against authoritarian leaders. In addition, the rapid pace of technological developments creates a more dynamic economy, making it harder for wealth to be limited to those who have inherited it. \u0027Once you have a much more agile transformed society where people do have the chance to rise from poor backgrounds to much more powerful backgrounds, they are much less likely to accept the status quo,\u0027 Roser said. 7. This is a time of relative peace, with fewer  international conflicts            This chart illustrates the worldwide decrease in international conflicts since 1500Finally, Rosling observes that international conflicts and wars are actually on the decline after centuries of unrest. Since roughly 1500, two or more of the world\u0027s most powerful countries have been at war more than half of the time.While conflicts in Syria and Yemen are currently creating massive humanitarian crises, it\u0027s notable that there has been no war in Western Europe for about three generations. \u0027Many people overestimate how many people are killed in conflict because there is a lot of  news coverage of these items,\u0027 Roser said. \u0027If you look at the number of people who are killed by terrorism for 2016, 0.06 percent of the people that died in 2016 died because of terrorist attacks,\u0027 Roser added. \u0027And if we include conflict, that\u0027s a fifth of a percent. So much, much less than a percent of the world is dying from this (type of) violence.\u0027 Ultimately, Rosling - and Roser - held that there is much to be hopeful about as we look to the future and learn from the past.\u0027We shouldn\u0027t diminish the tragedies of the droughts and famines happening right now,\u0027 Rosling wrote. \u0027But knowledge of the tragedies of the past should help everyone realize how the world has become both much more transparent and much better at getting help to where it\u0027s needed.\u0027 Our World in Data"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/01/15/08/45BCA3C200000578-0-image-m-4_1547540226039.jpg","title":"Pound holds ground soaring against dollar Euro","story":"    The pound started to rise against the dollar in the moments after the no-confidence vote, which Mrs May\u0027s government won with 325 votes against 306.

It is as far removed from the sort of tomato-growing operation most of us might have in our back gardens — except in one respect: the delicious smell of fresh tomatoes.These plants (all traditional varieties, nothing genetically modified) emerge from growbags filled with coir (recycled coconut husks) plus charcoal and friendly bacteria. Each bag has a couple of hydroponic straws feeding it a liquid diet of nutrient-rich rainwater captured from the roof, while violently pink LED lights make up for the lack of sunshine on a wet and freezing East Anglian afternoon.I arrive on the same morning as a fresh consignment of 15,000 baby vines from a Dutch propagation unit. They\u0027re laid out in just a few hours by a workforce of 27.Things move fast round here. Next month, the first batch of plants — which arrived just before Christmas — will already be producing their fruit, all premium plum and cherry tomatoes still on the vine and destined for British supermarkets.As operations director Richard Lewis points out, keeping harvested fruit on the vine retains freshness, as the last thing you want to do with a tomato is chill it.\u0027A tomato is like a Brie. Put it in the fridge and you loses all the flavour and texture,\u0027 he explains.          In the pink: Staff tend to the young plants at the East Anglia greenhouse At this time of year, the large majority of tomatoes in Britain have to be imported by refrigerated lorries from southern Europe. Even modern British glasshouses wind down production in the winter due to the lack of light. But this place will be generating home-grown tomatoes all year round.I am in phase one of the scheme which stretches across 14 acres — or 5.6 hectares as they say in a business that is firmly metric. This shiny new building will shortly be extended across another three hectares.Then, a similar glasshouse is due to go up in a neighbouring field. Eventually — after a total outlay of £30 million — the whole lot will cover 42 acres and employ 150 people.Even though I am looking at what will amount to a fraction of the final operation, it is still a mammoth project. This would make a perfectly respectable mid-size international airport.What hits you first is the sheer pinkness of it all. The plants need artificial light to produce all year round and white light generates too much heat, hence the choice of red and blue LED lights to bathe everything in pink.On walking through the airtight door, you sense a gentle breeze. All the plants sit on a raised metal platform beneath a tubular duct gently pumping extra air and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This raises the air pressure, which is another barrier to pesky insects (no pesticides are allowed in here) and makes it easier to control the heat.Tomatoes grow best at 23 degrees. In winter, heated water from the rainwater reservoir is circulated just like a central heating system.On a sunny day in midsummer, though, temperatures can get to a tropical 30 degrees-plus in a glasshouse. Most places can do little more than open the windows, which even then does little to reduce the heat.This one has an air-conditioning system which involves pouring recycled rainwater over huge panels of waxed cardboard next to the air-ducts, which blow the water particles around. Apparently, it can reduce the temperature by up to 15 degrees.Richard Lewis is one of Britain\u0027s best-known tomato growers, with 35 years experience in the business (he even has a cherry tomato named after him).His name will be on the packaging when this produce hits the shops, and he is bursting with enthusiasm as he shows me round, much like a child with a new train set.But then he does have a new train set. All the central heating pipes, 40 miles of them in parallel lines, double up as rail-tracks running along the floor. A fleet of electric carriages with cherry-picker platforms run along the tracks to help with maintenance and harvesting.          The LED light at the greenhouse (pictured) makes up for the lack of sunlight in wintry SuffolkString, wires and hooks will help each stalk climb 15 feet to a top wire, from where it will drop back down another 15 feet to the base and then trail horizontally along a series of pegs. Each plant will have a life cycle of 13 months before being replaced.None of it would happen without a crucial part of the workforce — the bumble bees, 150 of which live in each of the 65 cardboard box hives scattered around the building.The bumble bees, used to pollinate the plants, are in their element, though they must be replaced every few months when the queen gets restless.As they can\u0027t get out through the anti-insect wall, the hives are relocated to a large wild-flower meadow which has been planted nearby. It\u0027s a sort of twilight home for elderly bees while buzzing boxes of new workers are brought in.The human workforce is interesting, too. Richard says his only job advertising was to put a sign on the gate and people came flocking. Just over half are from Eastern Europe but the rest are locals and there\u0027s an apprenticeship scheme in the pipeline.Crop manager Liam Walker, 26, who began his career picking strawberries in neighbouring Norfolk, says this plant is the envy of the East Anglian greenhouse community.And it hasn\u0027t been put together by some monster corporation. In fact, it is down to a very British consortium involving a couple of adventurous local farmers, a few experts like Richard Lewis and a lot of small investors.When high street banks declined to back the idea, the founders went to a fund management company, Amberside Capital, which raised the £15 million for the first phase from small investors. Some people now even have a tomato Inidual Savings Account (ISA).Now that it\u0027s up and running, however, the banks are queuing up to help with phase two.After all, whatever happens on the Brexit front, Britain\u0027s appetite for fresh, succulent tomatoes is never going to change one bit.Bloody Mary, anyone? "},{"url":null,"title":"Miserable residents Welsh town waiting Christmas bins picked up","story":"    Households in Conwy, North Wales, which introduced monthly collections for 50,000 homes in September, have had to wait more than three weeks after Christmas for the bin trucks to appear.

Ahead of an exhibition at the British Museum, Jonathan Jones charts its rise, from the 1893 original to today’s inflatables and emojisThe face is a greenish sock of sickly flesh stretched tight over the skull. Its features have been burned away by pain. All that remain in the elongated mask are two wide round eyes with dots for pupils, a pair of black nostrils and a mouth open in an oval scream. We’ve all been there.The Scream was created by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893 but it has become a masterpiece – the masterpiece – for our time. There are comparably “iconic” works of art – the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Sunflowers – but they exist in a world of art and beauty. The Scream is ugly and brutal and belongs in the here and now. It is a symbol we reach for as we might for a strong word, to express what we’re feeling this minute.The cartoonist Peter Brookes called on it to sum up what so many were feeling when Donald J Trump was elected president of the United States. In Brookes’s depiction of Trump’s inauguration, every single person in the crowd has metamorphosed into the wraith-like figure from The Scream. They sway in unison, hands to their hollowed faces, clad in black smocks.You don’t have to be a professional cartoonist to express yourself with The Scream – you just need to text. The emoji sign “face screaming in fear” neatly sums up Munch’s image as a yellow face turning blue as it opens its mouth to scream, with eyes wide open, hands pressed to its cheeks in shock. It’s a handy emoji if you’re traumatised by Brexit … or climate change, or plastic in the oceans, or emojis.There are plenty of reasons to scream, says Hugo Chapman, the keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum. “Is that not the feeling of our time?” he asks of Munch’s image. Chapman’s department is usually where scholars fill out forms to study Rubens drawings or old maps of Somerset, but its announcement of a new exhibition has sent headlines spinning simply because Edvard Munch: Love and Angst, which opens in April, will include the 1895 lithographic version of The Scream. Chapman says the museum has not been surprised by the shrieks of excitement. “We have hit at a time of maximum anxiety that all of us feel incredibly strongly,” he told me on the eve of the meaningful vote in the House of Commons on Theresa May’s Brexit deal.It is also a time of sardonic laughter, and surely part of the resonance of The Scream in these strange times is its comic hyperbole. A huge part of the global population was transfixed in the silent pose of Munch’s screamer on Trump’s inauguration day – and we still are – but there is also a blackly comic release in recognising our plight in this late-Romantic image. In fact, many appropriations of The Scream by popular culture are a howl. A chain of self-consciously youthful and riotous pubs called It’s A Scream used Munch’s painting as an advert for booze and bad behaviour. An artist called Robert Fishbone found a new sideline when he created an inflatable version of The Scream that became a must-have novelty for art students and existentialists everywhere. And in Wes Craven’s 1996 film Scream, which is at once a satire on slasher horror movies and a highly effective resurrection of the genre, the killer wears a white Halloween mask version of Munch’s screaming face. It is both ridiculous and gruesome.These examples of The Scream’s irresistible rise in the shattered modern mind originated in the 1990s, which seems to have been the decade that saw Munch’s picture start its final ascent from a famous masterpiece of modern art to the most recognised, quoted and gazed-at icon of all. As a matter of fact, its triumph can be dated exactly. Today’s cult of The Scream started 25 years ago, on 12 February 1994. That was when thieves stole the original 1893 painting from Norway’s National Gallery. Detective Charles Hill, who was sent to Oslo from Scotland Yard’s specialist art squad to help get it back, remembers that it was not a very impressive heist: “It was two men and a ladder.” Detectives got in touch with the criminals and, astonishingly, convinced them that California’s Getty Museum was prepared to buy this piece of toxic contraband.“I appeared as the man from the Getty,” says Hill. He negotiated with the crooks, refusing an offer to go somewhere unspecified with them, purportedly to see it, by dead of night, and ultimately helping to secure it just three months after it was stolen. Art crime may be ugly, but it is also popular recognition of a kind. You know you’ve made it when the criminal community rates your works theft-worthy. Although the Mona Lisa was always renowned, its theft from the Louvre in 1911 and recovery two years later catapulted it from genteel totem to pop icon. The theft of The Scream had a similar electrifying effect. It even started a gangland fashion. In 2004, masked gunmen seized Munch’s second painted version of The Scream, which dates from 1910, from the Munch Museum in Oslo. This time it took longer to get back, and suffered some nasty damage.The 1990s also saw The Scream mirror a wider cultural mood. The end of the brash yuppy era brought a new emotional openness. Munch’s fin-de-siècle masterpiece suited another fin de siècle a century after its creation. Contemporary artists were returning to his themes of inner darkness with installations that used thick black crude oil, preserved animal bodies or a cast of a house. One Young British Artist, Tracey Emin, was consciously inspired by Munch in her confessional work My Bed, which is a kind of scream expressed through full ashtrays and empty bottles. Emin is now working on a seven-metre nude statue in homage to Munch that has been commissioned for the new Munch Museum in Oslo harbour, due to open next year.If The Scream spoke in a new key to the late 20th century, the anxieties of this century, which started on 11 September 2001, have made it seem the most contemporary of all masterpieces. Its translation into an emoji is truly significant. The Scream emoji makes explicit the striking fact that it is getting hard to say the word “scream” without seeing The Scream. This painting is becoming part of the language. The Scream has become part of a shift to reconnect idea and images, to express ourselves in the internet age by direct visual icons. It is not just a painting that makes a good emoji. It is the original emoji.To see the revolutionary nature of Munch’s achievement, you only have to see how he first rendered into art the experience that The Scream records. In 1892, he painted Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. It shows a man leaning on the wooden railing of a bridge, looking out on to a darkling blot of a fjord beneath a yellow sky smeared with red clouds of apocalyptic fire. Two other figures parade the boardwalk, leaving him to his depressed thoughts. The railings and walkway rushing away in steep perspective to the left of the scene, the paranoia-inducing figures walking away, the curve of the fjord – this is unmistakably the landscape of The Scream. For both paintings depict a real experience, a transforming, unforgettable moment of revelation. Was it an artistic ecstasy, like the visions of Romantic poets including Blake and Coleridge, or an episode of mental illness? In 1908, Munch wrote it down. He tells of how he was walking with two friends near Kristiania – as Oslo was then called – when the sun went down over the fjord. At the time, he writes, “life had ripped open my soul”.Born in Ådalsbruk in 1863, Munch grew up in Kristiania amid poverty, puritanism and illness. One of his first paintings, The Sick Child, is a memory of seeing his sister die. As a young artist, he had to struggle with frequent illnesses, rejection, alcoholism and a tempestuous relationship in which he got shot. He was also witness to a murderous love affair among his bohemian friends. So as he looked at the sunset that evening, the sky split open not just in clouds of red but a bloody, volcanic, atomic rupture in the fabric of reality itself: “Then it seemed as if a flaming sword of blood slashed through the heavens’ vault – The air became like blood – with piercing strands of fire – The fjord – glared in cold blue – yellow and red colours – bloody red screeched – on the road – and on the railing – My friends’ faces turned glaring yellow-white … ”This is the moment he depicts in Sick Mood at Sunset: Despair. In this painting, we see his anguish from the outside. The sky is gory, but it is in the closed mind of the man brooding with his face turned away from us that it feels like the end of the world. We see his despair, but it is not ours. We are like the audience watching Hamlet: involved yet outside his tragedy.The following year, Munch obliterated that gap between actor and audience, artwork and onlooker. In 1893, he created his first two versions of The Scream. The one that is in Oslo’s National Gallery is done with tempera, that is, egg-based paints and crayon on cardboard. The other, in crayon alone, also on cardboard, belongs to the Munch Museum. In both of them, he simplifies his vision of the nightmare sunset into bands and nodules of colour, almost like the flow of woodgrain. More radically, he replaces his brooding man with a figure who has no identifiable sex and may even be a ghost or ghoul. Clad in a dark dress or tight robe, its face reduced to that caricature of dread beyond words, the screamer does not look at the mad sky but directly at us. It is us.By removing all iniduality from this being, Munch allows anyone to inhabit it. He draws a glove puppet for the soul. Absurd and empty, it is filled by the scream its mouth shapes – and that scream, claimed Munch, comes from the landscape itself. He testified that he truly heard a scream pierce the sky and fjord as he gazed on the terrible fiery sunset: “I felt a great scream – and I actually heard a great scream – The colours of nature broke up – the lines of nature – the lines and the colours – quivered in motion – These oscillations of light not only caused my eye to vibrate – they also brought my ear into vibration – so that I truly heard a scream – I then painted the picture Scream.”In Norwegian it is “skrik”, whose jarring note sounds more like the English “shriek” than “scream”. The resemblance is no coincidence but clearly reflects the Viking infuence on our language. So Munch felt nature shriek. The imagery he uses is telling: as he watched, the light seemed to shake, the colours of nature to warp before or, rather, within his eyes. As his visual sense shook, it set off something in his ears. This is an instance of synesthesia, when experiences ramify through more than one of our senses. Munch was undergoing the kind of hallucinatory, multi-sensory, almost out-of-body adventure associated with visionary episodes from shamanism to psychedelia. It was part of a dangerous descent to the edge of madness that would eventually lead to him being hospitalised. And in The Scream, by creating a figure anyone can identify with, a pure embodiment of feeling, he lets us enter that same extreme state.The Scream is so much more than a receptacle for the anxiety we’re feeling right now. It can rescue us. It offers a means of release from the grind and banality of politics, money and work. The true purpose of the greatest modern art is to reconnect us with demonic, ecstatic experiences that defy the boredom of modern industrial capitalism. Maybe Munch was possessed by the Vikings when he heard the world scream. For The Scream seems pagan and primitive in its shudder at the iciness of the empty north. It is a painting of Ragnarök – the Norse apocalypse. Which makes it even more the masterpiece for our time. Play Led Zeppelin’s Immigrant Song and stare at The Scream.

It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands’I took the picture in the summer of 2013, in a rural part of northern Austria. I grew up in Holland. I went back there in 2012 to try to recapture my own childhood, but the farm where I was born no longer existed and the people I knew as a child no longer lived there. And then I found my childhood – or what I wished it had been – here, in the Austrian countryside.I was asked to do a documentary project about the Waldviertel region, which is how I came to meet these two local little girls, Hannah and Alena. Their mother, Sonja, asked if I would take some pictures of them.That summer, I travelled to their grandmother’s farm in a village called Waldberg, between Vienna and the Czech Republic. It’s where they always spend their holidays. We became friends and I’ve been going back ever since to photograph them.The two boys – Martin, who is on the swing with the girls, and his brother Christian, whose hands and feet peek out from behind them – are their friends who spend their summers at the farm, too. When I first met Christian, all he wanted to talk about was my camera. But, from the outset, the girls simply did their own thing. I would start our sessions with a few posted portraits, but soon they would get bored and ignore me. And that’s when I would begin to work.I think I was lying on the ground to get this shot, with my 35mm. It’s a camera I love because it allows me to be right inside the image, and I want my viewers to feel the same thing.I don’t know if I purposefully avoided showing their full faces. It wasn’t to anonymise them. Rather, it was to capture something more universal. Instead of looking into their eyes, you follow their inidual gazes, and you see the social dynamics at play between them. But I’m not really interested in what they’re playing with. Here, I hate those metal pipes, they spoil my picture. And without the children, there is no picture.Alena, the older girl, is at the centre of the image, and that’s true in how they play together. It’s a role that naturally falls to her – she is in charge, she decides what they’re going to do, and where they’re going to play. The others are happy to follow her lead. And while any other adult – a parent or a grandparent – might be tempted to intervene (“Don’t do that” or “That’s too rough”), I don’t judge, I don’t comment, or direct anything. I might be present, but the kids are on their own. Wherever they go, I go. They don’t see me. They’re in their own world.It’s a nostalgic image, with a touch of magic from those disembodied feet and hands of Christian’s. The longer I live, the more I long to be a child again. This project has perhaps been more about looking not for my actual childhood, but one I might have had.When I was two, my father and older sister Anita were in a car accident. Anita was killed, and my father was left with the mental age of a child of seven. So the only father I knew, growing up, was someone who was aggressive, and of whom I was ashamed. He wasn’t a normal father. Perhaps this is why I look for the idyllic, or the romantic in the stories I shoot – to balance things out, as a coping mechanism. I think that the most important things that happen to you, in life, happen between the ages of two and 12.When I see these four children here, in their own world, what I love is that they’re in charge. They are powerful. And that’s how I choose not only to depict children in my work, but also how I want to relate to them in everyday life: as human beings, as equals. Respected, empowered, not patronised. They inspire me.• Carla Kogelman’s I Am Waldviertel is at Schilt Gallery, Amsterdam, until 9 March.

It’s a memoir in which Luke Turner, best known as co-founder of the independent music website the Quietus, tries to explain – to himself as much as to us – how, over many years, he has resisted but also honoured his bisexuality. It’s an account of falling out of love with London and seeking both solace and newness in nature. It’s a social history of Epping Forest, a piece of woodland that, straddling London and Essex, is also bi. A disturbing trauma narrative, it’s also a work of delightfully low, pants-dropping comedy, and a learned meditation, influenced by 17th-century Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico, on the nature of knowledge.The book begins with Turner splitting up with his long-term girlfriend even though, he insists, he still loved her. Something was troubling him. It was the same thing that was becoming a compulsion: a desire “to feel the naked press of a man on top of me”. Over the next few months he acts on that desire, and then some. He also sleeps with women – not a few of them. He’s hungry, confused, sometimes reckless. Unmoored, he moves around the fringes of London, kipping in friends’ flats and attics, and spending as much time as possible in Epping Forest. He hopes that nature will offer a cure, some clarity.Forests have long been seen as shelters for outlaws – and for outlaw sexuality. Some locals refer to Epping Forest as “Effing Forest”. Pollarding has transformed and even sexualised the trees themselves so that, according to Turner, they resemble “cows’ udders, a pair of buttocks climbing into a hollow, old men’s balls, a phallus between thighs, great, heavy, warty growths, welts like parted vulva”.Turner marries Joe Orton and Michel Foucault in his descriptions of how, over the centuries, men have been forced “by law and religious prejudice into twilighting their sexuality to find a knee-trembler under a hornbeam”. They use off-paths and low branch overhangs to create “a private network, beyond cartography, beyond nature”. Discarded tissues and condoms become “territorial markers of a queer autonomous zone where heterosexuals might be advised not to tread”. But this is no sylvan utopia having asked a forest keeper why so many fires have been blazing in parts of its grassland, Turner is told: “It’s people trying to burn out the gays.”Turner is not ashamed of being bisexual. He says he struggles against “the binary rules of heteronormative love”. Why then does he feel so messed up? He ponders his upbringing and evokes an adolescence many readers will recognise: the fear of getting an erection in the changing room showers, the glee at finding a sports holdall full of copies of Club International, the silent drama of giving a classmate (whom he later dubs “Tippex Boy”) a hand job under the desk during a chemistry lesson, the struggle to make sense of our shifting, seemingly aberrant desires.Art can be a lifeline at these times. It can name our dilemmas, legitimise our weird feelings. Turner found solace and possibilities in Withnail and I. The band Suede inspired him to wear women’s blouses and dye his hair red. Derek Jarman became “a mythic figure in my imagination, an alchemist who used his genius behind the camera to turn the moral opprobrium of society, the dirt of shame, into a seething power a counterattack.”Turner’s sexual turmoil was intensified by the fact that his parents were not only practising, but also preaching, Christians. His mother grew up in a fundamentalist sect that forbade most forms of 20th‑century mass culture, and the self-lacerating language of guilt and shame and unworthiness comes easily to him. Yet he respects their Methodism, is introduced to a lineage of English radicalism (Gerrard Winstanley, the Levellers) through it, and draws on its heightened ways of seeing as he immerses himself in the life of the forest and the altered states of consciousness it engenders. For him, forests, though often portrayed by theologians as pagan or Dionysian, are churches without walls, fecund in spirituality.Out of the Woods (parts of it first appeared on the Caught by the River website, which has become a reliable treasure trove of contemporary natural history) reads both like a seance and an act of exorcism, a necessary purging. Will Ashon’s Strange Labyrinth (2017), also about Epping Forest, devoted chapters to the anarcho-punk bank Crass, whose members Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher have long maintained an open house there. Turner’s reference points are more eldritch: English occultist and draughtsman Austin Osman Spare, the band Coil, whose music he describes as “narcotic and queer it blurs the boundaries between our expectations of sonic urbanism and the pastoral psychedelic”.At times, as he chafes against his background – its emphasis on sport, hearty masculinity, middle-Englishness (he admits to having campaigned for Tory MP Peter Lilley at a school election) – he recalls Stephen, the vicar’s son in David Rudkin’s visionary drama Penda’s Fen (1974) who discovers that he is “nothing pure! My sex is mixed. I am woman and man! I am mud and flame!” Like Penda’s Fen, Out of the Woods is animated by deep trauma: Turner’s confusion and shame about how, as a teenager, he was drawn to the public toilets in his home town and had oral sex with someone he guesses was five times his age. Was this abuse? If so, he wonders, what later drew him back to those places?Turner’s memoir succeeds at many levels. It explores the kinds of questions about identity and interconnectedness that academics such as Eduardo Kohn (how do forests think?) and Catriona Sandilands (are plants queer?) have been asking in recent years. It does so without jargon and without self-absorption (it’s peopled by sketches of outsider artists and eccentric forest dwellers). It offers no fake epiphanies or grand statements. But, as all gastroenterologists know, it suggests it would be a grave error to think of forests as external to us. We carry the forest with us, inside us. We are the forest. • Out of the Woods by Luke Turner is published by Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson (RRP £16.99). To order a copy for £12.99, go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.granitadicaffe has just “entered the gates of Purgatory” with Dante:In Il Purgatorio it takes 9 cantos before you reach Purgatory itself. On the way they meet and chat to various historical personages. The gates are a little hard to find and when you get there there are 3 large steps of marble outside: the first is white, smooth and polished, the second dark rough and cracked, and the third red like blood spurting from a vein. On these stands a big angel with a sword, who only opened the door after Virgil explained their mission. He used 2 keys, a silver and a gold one. If the latter, which is difficult to turn, won’t open then you can’t get in. It is hard to enter Purgatory but once you are inside you mustn’t look back!“I’m not a slow reader,” says kinson1964, but “I’ve been reading the same book since last year.” That book is Jerusalem by Alan Moore:A huge book (page numbers reach four figures) and it’s an amazing read. It deals with Northampton rather like Joyce deals with Dublin or Gray does with Glasgow - all human life (and death) is there together with a wealth of historical facts, trivia and metaphysical speculation. I now wish that I knew the town well for the extra psycho-geographical resonance.A Delicate Truth, “another le Carré novel leaving barbs deep in the body politic of the high and mighty of Britain”, has captivated notatalllover:Unputdownable, Toby Bell, the hero, showing the meaning of bouncebackability, having grabbed hold of the hand of someone under the cosh of the secret state faces brutal consequences in his desire to find the truth behind the lies and cover up hidden under the pacific blanket wielded by the Foreign Office. Again le Carré lets his readers know Britain is a police state in all but name. A rewarding read.A quick tip from Dennis89:Just finished Night Flight by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. A short novella and the ideal read for one sitting.... Beautiful prose and quite atmospheric for such a short book.And a fine idea from nkenny:I’ve been listening to the audiobook of Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson. It’s extremely funny and perfect for dipping in and out of during spare moments.Van Gogh’s letters have impressed marosc:They’re really good. The main element of his personality that’s coming out is commitment to authenticity - he’s determined to be himself even in the face of severe family pressure to conform and to be true to his artistic vision even when it means only selling a handful of pieces because he refuses to compromise to make his art more saleable. And his brother Theo must be the greatest art benefactor in history - pretty much single handedly supporting Vincent so he can dedicate himself to art - and what a legacy we’ve got because of that. The way Vincent writes about his art and comparing it with other artists (it’s not true that he was a loner - he was friends with Toulouse-Lautrec \u0026amp Seurat and, of course, began a failed attempt at an artists’ community with Gauguin) is totally engaging - you can really feel his excitement about what he’s doing.Emily Wilson’s translation of Homer’s Odyssey is, according to FrogC, “excellent”:It was not at all what I expected. The voyaging adventures are mostly told in flashback and take up a smaller part of the book than Odysseus’s return home and revenge upon the suitors who’ve been pestering his wife and eating him out of house and home. (I kept thinking, impertinently, that that was not how I would have written it.) And it’s a surprisingly cruel book - I ended up not liking Odysseus very much.Finally, Tom Mooney recommends A Different Drummer by William Melvin Kelley:In 1957, a young black farmer shoots his livestock, salts his fields and burns down his house. He then walks away from his fictional southern state. Every other black citizen follows his lead.From this brilliant set-up, Kelley tells the story of young Tucker Caliban, his ancestors and their masters, owners and bosses, entirely through the eyes of the white people left behind in town.There are a lot of moving parts in this novel but they tie together beautifully come the end. It’s at times hopeful and cynical, moral and immoral, simple and complex. Almost 60 years after it was first published it feels incredibly fresh and would sit happily alongside the works of Ellison, Baldwin and other great writers on civil rights in the US.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Other shareholders later put up £15m, £10m of which was used to pay back half of Johnson’s loan.The company was valued at £450m when the problem was uncovered, but the shares were suspended and have yet to restart trading.The company’s finance director, Chris Marsh, was arrested by Hertfordshire police, bailed and resigned.The Serious Fraud Office has confirmed that it has opened a criminal investigation into an inidual but has not given further information.The Financial Reporting Council is meanwhile investigating accountancy firm Grant Thornton for its role as auditor to Patisserie Valerie.The group’s chief executive, Paul May, resigned in November and was replaced by Steve Francis, a turnaround expert who previously ran the pork producer Tulip. Only Johnson and the deputy chairman, Lee Ginsberg, remain of the original board.On Wednesday, the company said it had hired accountants KPMG in an attempt “to preserve value for its stakeholders going forward”.It is understood that a number of options are being considered. However, KPMG is known for its expertise in restructuring and insolvency, particularly a procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement. CVAs enable businesses to renegotiate rental agreements with landlords or close stores.They have been used by a string of casual dining chains, including Carluccio’s, Byron and Jamie’s Italian, to reduce their high street presence amid a slowdown in consumer spending in an oversaturated market.Patisserie Valerie was granted a standstill of its banking facilities until this Friday, protecting it from action to recover debts, and is in talks with its lenders to extend the agreement. The company has previously said it wanted the standstill to last a year.When the scandal was first revealed, Patisserie Valerie said an initial investigation of its accounts showed that instead of having £28m in the bank, as the company had previously told the City, it was nearly £10m in debt.In a 12 October statement it said underlying profits might have been only £12m in the year to 19 September, compared with £26m reported a year before. The new update said that £12m was an overestimate.It added that it would take some time before a reliable trading outlook could be produced.Johnson has waived his £60,000 salary and pledged to give up some of his other directorships as he tries to turn around the chain.He remains chair of at least 10 boards including the Almeida theatre in London, the Institute of Cancer Research, the entrepreneurial campaigning group StartUp Britain and a number of companies held by Risk Capital – his investment company.

All the familiar banking features of greed, incompetence and hubris are present. And all the main players look ridiculous.Top of the list is Ana Botín, the Spanish bank’s executive chair. Recruiting Orcel, an Italian investment banker, was a bizarre move in the first place. Orcel, at UBS and previously at Merrill Lynch, was a longstanding adviser to Santander on acquisitions, but deal merchants tend to make terrible retail bankers.Botín’s biggest mistake, however, was to announce the appointment last September before she had squared Orcel’s money. Who would pick up the tab for Orcel’s pile of unvested rewards at UBS, reputed to be as much as €50m? It was an obvious issue.Usual practice is for the new employer to shoulder the sum, but for Santander to shell out €50m worth of shares just to get Orcel through the door would cause a storm in Spain, not least among the customers. Botín seems to have gambled that she could bully UBS into taking some of the hit, since the Swiss bank presumably wanted to continue to serve as adviser to Santander. When UBS refused to cough up, she was in a pickle. Her own board seems to have told her to call the whole thing off.Orcel emerges as ridiculous because he quit his lucrative gig at UBS before he had tied down his new contract at Santander, an astonishing oversight on his part. He could, of course, have agreed to cut his price to secure a job he apparently craved, but that idea seems to have gone nowhere.Do not weep for him. By rights, his status as a respected adviser should have been ruined for his role in helping Royal Bank of Scotland buy the toxic parts of ABN Amro in 2007, a deal that led to RBS’s collapse the following year. Orcel was reportedly paid £7.5m for that gig.At a push, one might say the refuseniks on Santander’s board emerge with credit for saving the bank from a bigger PR disaster. Really, though, they should be asking themselves whether Botín, the towering figure at the bank, has too much power.As for UBS, it was entirely within its rights to refuse to cooperate, but it will also have to explain how Orcel could have clocked up such huge rewards during his seven-year stint. It’s not as if UBS’s share price has soared in that period.As a demonstration of how little has changed at the big banks since the crisis a decade ago, the Orcel parable is hard to beat. The sums remain enormous and the cult of the superstar banker remains entrenched. The only difference is that boards are sometimes dimly aware that the outside world is repulsed.Orcel described the banking industry as “too arrogant, too self-convinced” in the pre-crash years when he appeared before the UK’s banking standards commission in 2013. The idea was that the future would be different. Ho, ho.It is hard to choose the most shocking ingredient in Patisserie Holding’s latest confession.Was it the revelation that the financial misstatements uncovered last October stemmed from “thousands of false entries into the company’s ledgers”? Was it the news that profits will be “materially below” even the reduced sums predicted soon after the scandal was revealed? Or is it in the fact that the firm is still trying to extend its standstill banking facilities beyond this Friday?The borrowing deadline looks hideously tight but, if common sense prevails, one suspects the banks will probably play ball. In theory, there should still be a profitable business somewhere beneath the sticky mess.All the same, the chairman, Luke Johnson, is taking a very long time to get the bottom of this affair. Forensic accountants have been on the job for three months, yet it will still be “some time before a reliable trading outlook can be completed”.Johnson did the honourable thing last October in pumping in £20m of his own money in loans to keep the firm alive and organising emergency fundraising. He has also appointed an entirely new management team. Well done, but come on, Patisserie Valerie runs a chain of cake shops it is not an international conglomerate. Clarity should not take this long."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eefc8aeab7c0340ed2b70897af6531556152b656/0_0_5173_3104/master/5173.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1be76b5102b3fae65fe4d9137636d880","title":"our vegetables are full of dirty secrets how organic could be the answer","story":"Organic farming places less stress on our environment and has even been shown to yield healthier crops. So why aren’t more farmers opting for this alternative?It’s a loss that has been driven by the intensification of farming to produce our food, fuelled by an increased use of pesticides and fertilisers to keep weeds and pests at bay and help crops grow. This is bad news for wildlife, as it not only takes away potential food sources for birds, mammals and other animals, but can also poison them and contaminate local watercourses. Marginal habitats, such as ponds and hedgerows, have also been lost in the drive to grow more food.This boost in wildlife is a result of organic practices, including growing a greater variety and rotation of crops, having bigger and more erse hedgerows, and avoiding the use of pesticides to protect crops from weeds, insects and diseases. This means organic farms are home to more insects, weeds and other plants that can then, for example, feed birds through the winter months.For organic farmers, it’s about farming with as much wildlife as is manageable. “I like to think of my land as open to wildlife rather than abandoning it,” says Guy Singh-Watson, farmer and founder of the organic delivery business Riverford.They also cannot rely on supermarkets to take their produce – their avoidance of pest-controlling chemicals means they have to deal with more variability in terms of quality. The carrots produced by Patrick Holden, the former head of organic trade body the Soil Association, were infamously rejected by his supermarket buyer over quality issues. “Supermarkets are preaching localism but it’s just tokenism. Their systems are still going in the opposite direction, and it’s disastrous,” he says.Singh-Watson’s organic farm, in south Devon, survives through his UK-wide vegetable box scheme. “It’s very difficult if you are supplying a supermarket. A lot of pesticides are used quite unnecessarily, because the farmer cannot afford to have their crop rejected by buyers.”Plants produce many of their antioxidant compounds to fight back against pest attacks, so the higher levels in organic crops may result from their lack of protection by chemical sprays, say researchers.The study, completed in 2014, also found that pesticide residues were four times more likely to be found in conventional crops than organic ones.The study’s conclusions have been questioned by other academics, who said there were not enough high-quality studies to support the conclusion that organic food was nutritionally different to conventionally produced food. A review by the UK food standards agency in 2009 found that organic food provides no significant health benefits over conventionally produced food.But Leifert has called for more research on the issue. “We have shown, without doubt, that there are composition differences between organic and conventional crops. Now there is an urgent need to carry out well-controlled human dietary intervention and quantify the health impacts of switching to organic food.”Want to eat more ethically?

Six of the top 20 cities were in the US, with European and Australian cities also showing a strong interest in going meat-free.Google searches won’t give you an accurate idea of how many people commit to vegan diets or buy vegan products, but Chef’s Pencil says the analysis does tell you there “is an intent in taking action about your diet” in these cities.“In Bristol there is a vibrant local community,” says a spokesperson from Chef’s Pencil, “and having a core community of vegans plays a huge role because they’re so active and loud. If you have a vegan friend you will know it.”Bristol has long been seen as place for all things green and liberal. It’s home to the Viva! animal rights campaigning group. Three out of four Bristol MPs say they are vegan or veggie. And the online community Vegan Bristol has a long, thorough list of places that are meat-free.Portland’s vegan voice is equally loud. Paul McCartney and the animal rights campaign group Peta named it the most vegan-friendly city in 2016, even handing the mayor a bouquet of vegetables. Portland has a vegan summer camp, a venue for punk music that also promotes veganism, a vegan shopping mall and even a vegan strip club.The rise of veganism has undoubtedly been led by city dwellers. A 2016 UK survey by the Vegan Society found veganism was significantly more popular in urban areas rather than rural places. Two-thirds of those surveyed who said they didn’t eat meat and avoided dairy products lived in urban and suburban Britain.This is partly due to a greater ease of access to vegan options, according to Sam Calvert from the Vegan Society. A vegan for 24 years, she remembers a lot of friends in previous years saying it would be “too hard” to eat out and find suitable alternatives. With more choices available now, people are more likely to make that leap.“The typical vegan would be young and female, and you’re more likely to find young people in cities,” she says. “As with all communities it’s easier to find more people of the same in cities. There are lots of vegan meet-up groups, which tend to be in cities.”That same year Turin’s new mayor declared the Italian city to be the world’s first “vegan city”.“The promotion of vegan and vegetarian diets is a fundamental act in safeguarding our environment, the health of our citizens and the welfare of our animals,” the city said in a statement. It was intended as programme to raise awareness of sustainability and alternatives to meat, but was unsurprisingly isive.If being a true “vegan city” involved banning the sale of meat or dairy products, then the Gujarat town of Palitana would be on the list. A hunger strike by Jain monks in 2014 led to the local government declaring the city and its holy sites to be meat-free zones.Most lists of vegetarian- or vegan-friendly cities are based on the number of veggie restaurants or cafes in a place rather than the amount of people interested in practising veganism.According to Happy Cow, a crowdsourced list of veggie and vegan restaurants, London is the most vegan-friendly city in the world. It was the first on the site to surpass 100 completely vegan restaurants, in 2017, and currently has 110 vegan eateries in a five-mile radius within the city. It is closely followed by Berlin, with 65 vegan restaurants within a five-mile radius.But perhaps it is all in a name. Last year animal rights activists tried to change the name of the West Country village of Wool to “Vegan Wool”. If the proposal had been accepted by the parish council (it wasn’t), then this unassuming place in Dorset would have surely taken the title of the world’s vegan capital by default.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a882ad563bd72aab8bcf1c1646f878207724360/555_475_3420_2052/master/3420.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1799c5b1bf64b856bcddf94d2ffa6801","title":"labour pursue better brexit deal second referendum norway plus","story":"It is, perversely, a sign of the government’s weakness, not its strength, that it has inevitably seen off a vote of no confidence. All that unites a bitterly fractious Conservative party is panic at the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government coming to power in a general election, a likelihood many are admirably honest about. If Theresa May was confident about the Tories’ prospects, she would risk throwing the dice. But Labour started the last election campaign 24 percentage points behind the Tories in the polls, and ended two points behind six weeks later. Today, the polling average has Labour slightly ahead. Conservatives fear that a Corbyn-led administration would not be like a “normal” Labour government, and would upend an economic consensus established by Margaret Thatcher. And they would be right.The media will now attempt to shift the narrative, claiming that it is Labour under pressure. This is absurd. The government has just suffered the biggest parliamentary defeat in the history of British democracy. A disastrous near-decade of Tory rule has left Britain in its worst combined political and social crisis in modern times, the consequence of ideologically driven austerity and catastrophic political decisions by both David Cameron and May. Labour will be pilloried for not having a magical solution – when there is none – to a crisis engineered by its opponents.There will be claims that, having lost this no-confidence attempt, Labour’s democratically agreed official policy dictates that it must now support a second referendum. But this is inaccurate. The policy states that the “best outcome for the country is an immediate general election that can sweep the Tories from power”, but if such an election cannot be engineered, the party “must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote”.If Labour imposed a three-line whip in support of a referendum, shadow cabinet members representing leave constituencies have told me they will resign. If a referendum becomes the only option left, then Labour will have to campaign for remain, and make a great fist of it. But don’t have any illusions. The campaign will be even more bitter and vicious than the last the culture war that has enveloped the country will get worse millions of leave voters will be angered and even more disillusioned than before and under a slogan of “tell them again”, leave may well win once more. Tory rule is the source of the nation’s ills: wishing to remove this Conservative government – and the only means of doing so is a Labour victory – is not putting “party before country”, it’s an attempt to save the nation from the most calamitous administration since the war. Of Labour’s 54 Tory-held target seats, 41 voted leave. Just 13 opted for remain. Without holding on to its existing leavers and winning over more, Labour cannot win an election, and the injustices that helped lead to the Brexit vote will be exacerbated.So what does the party do? It must make a pitch to unite the country. The Tories have sought to represent only the leave side – and even then, not the bread-and-butter concerns of leave voters – and their key media supporters have demonised remainers. Labour must emphasise that the real conflict is not between supporters or opponents of Brexit, but the vast majority against the elite. It must refocus the debate on what unites both tribes, such as living standards, jobs, the NHS, taxing the rich and public ownership. That means advocating a compromise. A majority does exist in parliament for a customs union. And although many within the Labour leadership regard it as unsatisfactory, so-called Norway plus, combining the single market and a customs union, has a good chance of winning support across the parliamentary ide. The EU has made it clear that a shift in Britain’s red lines will open up new opportunities. That will refocus the debate on bitter Tory isions, too.Labour will be shouted down by a vocal lobby if it fails to back a second referendum. But, for now, the party must surely direct its efforts at constructing a new deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d1164a61064d32af3a6afb08b41bec5307964c/0_184_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=164745542d346e98e16c80b7cac028ce","title":"the guardian view on brexit and parliament now dissolve the red lines","story":"A Commons vote affirming confidence in Her Majesty’s government does not indicate that parliament trusts Theresa May. Her reprieve on Wednesday night, by a margin of 19, largely expresses Tory and DUP reluctance to risk a general election. Power is still flowing away from the prime minister.In 2017 voters deprived the Tories of a majority. Last December the government was found in contempt of parliament. One-third of Tory MPs have said they have no confidence in Mrs May as their party’s leader. On Tuesday, the prime minister’s Brexit deal was crushed in a Commons defeat greater than any recorded in the modern era. Mrs May’s authority has been stripped away her credibility is gone. Every precedent guides her towards resignation. But not much about Brexit follows precedent.Immediately after Wednesday’s vote the prime minister offered talks with leaders of opposition parties to break the impasse. It is a welcome shift in tone, but there is no indication from Mrs May’s record that she has the diplomatic skills required to make such a consultation fruitful. She has clung compulsively to her original negotiating “red lines” and still seems unaware that the Brexit model they defined is beyond resuscitation. Her resistance to compromise has ratcheted up the risk of Britain reaching the article 50 deadline without any deal.Despite Mrs May’s new overtures, Downing Street still formally rejects the prospect of a customs union with the EU, although softening that line would transform dialogue with Labour and pro-European Tories. A customs union alone does not dissolve obstacles in the Commons, nor does it resolve problems around the Irish border, but it is the foundation of any Brexit deal that stands a chance of achieving those goals. Mrs May’s objection is that it limits independence in trade talks and upsets hardline Tory Eurosceptics. But the UK’s leverage in talks with superpower blocs – the US, China, India, the EU – is vastly overstated and the Brexit hardliners will never be satisfied with any deal. Holding out for their approval is a waste of time.Mrs May speaks often about duty to the electorate, as if the choices she makes stand above party interest. The opposite is true: she has imprisoned herself in a narrow, parochial view of what Brexit means, conditioned by irrational attachment to the Tory right. It is imperative that she break free of those constraints. She must show sincerity in the offer to work across the house, which means giving serious consideration to proposals that cross the red lines: a customs union, Efta, the EEA or some combination of those institutional arrangements.There are models of a soft Brexit that have been developed by groups of Labour and Tory MPs, showing the bipartisan spirit that Mrs May lacks. Wednesday’s fierce no-confidence debate stoked fires of tribal party allegiance, but those flames cannot be allowed to consume the prospect of Brexit partnership. The government’s next step must be to engage with the authors of alternative Brexit blueprints and present them in parliament as a menu of options, subject to indicative, unwhipped votes. MPs must, in the first analysis, be allowed to coalesce around plans unconstrained by formal party lines. The Commons should consider how such ideas might be developed with wider popular consent, as envisaged in the innovative model of a citizens’ assembly. The public could then be given a final say on the choices available, including EU membership on current terms.That process demands an extension to the article 50 period. Even an off-the-shelf Brexit model needs enabling legislation, which takes time. The prime minister’s reluctance to admit as much is another symptom of her delusional obstinacy. Mrs May has routinely struggled to adapt to changing circumstance as events have progressively limited her room for manoeuvre. That rigidity seems intrinsic to her character, irrespective of invitations to cross-party talks. It is not enough to affect a change of tone in the aftermath of a fierce parliamentary debate. The shift in style is welcome and long overdue. But the prime minister must now urgently show readiness to compromise on the very substance of Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac8832d7fc4724f18329ed61fbe27d4002a1f5c2/68_0_3364_2019/master/3364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25c71116a9e35d7696dc88656a4b49b8","title":"theresa may compromise brexit","story":"The prime minister has survived a vote of no confidence. Her fate now rests on how flexible she is prepared to beIt is said that the past is a foreign country. But after the Brexit referendum, it is the present, not the past, where we do things differently. No government in British history has taken such a Commons beating as Theresa May suffered on Tuesday. Yet, 24 hours later, the selfsame MPs who had thrown out her UK-EU Brexit deal by 432 votes to 202 now handed her premiership a fresh lifeline. The 118 Conservative MPs who voted her policy down on Tuesday backed her on Wednesday, as though it were the most natural thing in the world to do.By voting by 325 to 306 that they still had confidence in May’s government, the House of Commons turned the ordinary meaning of words on their head. But this wasn’t a vote of confidence in any normal sense. It was a suboptimal tribal choice between a government led by May and one led by Jeremy Corbyn. It was a knockabout partisan ersion from the main national issue, which now resumes. The loss leaves Corbyn with fewer defences against Labour’s second-vote campaigners. But the victory also finds May still wedded to her defeated Brexit policy, and settled in for another year in Downing Street.There is no point in tut-tutting too much about this weird inversion. The Brexit referendum has challenged parliament’s legitimacy. It’s make-it-up-as-you-go-along time now for the Commons as Britain’s representative democracy, with its traditional Burkean emphasis on the assembled judgments of inidual local MPs, battles to accommodate itself to a referendum decision that most members didn’t want. Since June 2016, ministers, political parties and MPs have been continuously struggling to adjust, sometimes with the kind of bizarre consequences that we have witnessed this week.Get used to it, because the article 50 timetable is an implacable taskmaster. There are just 72 days before Brexit takes effect, on 29 March. Every day brings a new issue for MPs to focus on. Now the attention will shift to article 50. Unless it is stopped to permit the consideration of new options, such as a second referendum, or unless the withdrawal agreement MPs rejected this week is reinstated fairly soon in a different form, with a better prospect of success, Britain will tumble out of the EU with no deal – an outcome that most MPs say they oppose but which became more likely on Tuesday night.“What happens now?” is the question of the hour. May said on Tuesday that the government was listening to parliament. She has no alternative. But she has been a terrible listener in the past, and she has shown little appetite for serious listening in the last 48 hours either. After her win tonight she repeated Tuesday’s pledge to reach out to “parliamentarians” about ways forward. But that pledge is narrowly drawn. She remains foolishly focused on the priority of persuading Tory and DUP rebels to support her, not on looking for agreements with Labour or other opposition MPs.The days for that partisan approach are gone. She is in this mess because it does not work. She may be the least worst leader the Tory party has on offer, but she’s no Ole Gunnar Solskjaer with the magic touch. The penny dropped during the day that she would get nowhere if she insisted, as Andrea Leadsom appeared to say this morning, that she would not talk to Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders but would instead talk directly to Labour and other opposition backbenchers.She can’t pick and choose whom to talk to. If she did so, she would hang them out to dry in their own parties. And she can’t insist on too many preconditions either. It is fair enough for May to insist that the goal, if she genuinely reaches out, is to deliver a Brexit opposition MPs will support. But that Brexit can only be a different one from the one she tried and failed to persuade her own party and the DUP to support this week. She has to be ready to compromise, and to change her red lines. She has to be open to ruling out a no-deal exit, to extending article 50, to a form of permanent customs union that would effectively eliminate the Northern Ireland backstop problem, and to guaranteed regulatory alignments with the single market.If she takes that approach, she will be denounced by the Tory extreme right. But she lives with that problem already. The extreme right denounces her anyway. They vote against her, both as party leader and on Brexit. They don’t want a compromise. They want no deal. They want a bonfire of the regulations. They don’t care about climate change, the “just about managing”, the union or Ireland.But if she reaches out in the way she has so far failed to do – and perhaps now understands that she must – she may yet get her Brexit through parliament. It is a mistake to say that “May’s deal” is dead. It isn’t. The withdrawal agreement part of last November’s UK-EU deal has widespread support in the Commons. Most MPs support its three key features: reciprocal post-Brexit rights for citizens, a settlement of the UK’s debts and the avoidance of a hard border in Ireland.The problem for Commons moderates is with the second, shorter part of May’s deal, the political declaration on the future relationship with the EU. Here May fudged almost everything last November, kicking the can into the transition period because she is fearful of antagonising her own party on future economic ties with the EU. That fudge prevents Brexit pragmatists on the opposition benches from backing her deal. They would be buying a pig in a poke, in which they might end up facilitating a hard, deregulatory Brexit.Yet this is also, potentially, an opportunity for those pragmatists and for May to come together. If she and they can agree a domestic deal on the goals of the future relationship, to last until the next election in 2022, she might get her Brexit and they might get the regulatory alignment, customs union and soft border in Ireland they seek. Something similar might be achieved under a so-called Norway plus deal. If she is really daring, she might even craft a devolution-of-powers deal that the SNP, which has its own party leadership problems, might grab at, as might Welsh Labour. Tonight the SNP’s Ian Blackford, a practical man fallen among fanatics, sounded cautiously interested. All this would mean Britain leaving the EU – which is why it would stick in the throat of us pro-Europeans – but it would keep Britain a more European society.Franklin Roosevelt was the greatest political leader of the 20th century for many reasons. One of these was his pragmatic flexibility. Roosevelt believed the seriousness of the crisis that faced America in the 1930s required “persistent experimentation”. He once said it was common sense to try a policy and “if it fails, admit it frankly and try another”. It is the profoundest political common sense too. It allows a politician to fail yet retain trust. May can hardly be compared with Roosevelt. But he wrote the playbook that she needs to follow at this dire moment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38af637cc796b7b7567b570f0251c26a04f77871/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f6d481a5628cc5441a3ee8beab75348","title":"rupture eu brexit reform","story":"It’s not plausible that either Brexit in name only or no exit at all can lead to radical reform of our broken systemThe pound rose, and all was calm on the stock market. As far as the financial markets were concerned, the message was clear: the voting down by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit, a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all. Those with serious wealth in Britain have always been worried that Brexit will lead to radical change. They now think that there will be a perpetuation of the status quo – or something not far removed from it. Hence the pound getting stronger.There’s no question that opting for the quiet life has its attractions. There would be a boost to the economy as companies decided to push ahead with investment plans that had been delayed while the outcome of Brexit was uncertain. And, of course, any economic costs of no deal would be avoided.The EU’s single market is more than a free-trade area. It aims to remove not just the fiscal barriers to trade (tariffs) but the physical and technical barriers (borders and ergent product standards) too by allowing as free movement as possible of goods, capital, services and people. In essence, it is about treating the EU as a single trading territory.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.Even so, why bother suffering any cost at all if it can be avoided by leaving things as they are? That seems like a reasonable argument, but in reality it is based on a series of doubtful assumptions.The first is that voters care only about economic growth. But if that were the case, they would support fracking and concreting over the green belt, both of which would lead to higher levels of activity. The second – voiced by business lobby groups – is that it is not possible to do better than the status quo because unemployment is low, real wages are growing, the City is the world’s financial hub and the UK is an attractive destination for inward investment.The third – shared by the European commission and some in the remain camp in the UK – is that there is nothing much wrong with Europe either. The EU is the world’s biggest market the four freedoms allow for the movement of goods, people, money and services across the continent and the euro has been a success.Yet in reality the UK has malfunctioned badly since the 2008 financial crisis, suffering a prolonged period of weak productivity growth and flatlining living standards. Investment has been weak. Most of the jobs created have been low-wage and low-skill.As for the rest of Europe, the eurozone was even slower to recover from the crash, in part because of the design flaws of monetary union and in part because its addiction to neoconservative economic dogma resulted in supercharged austerity programmes.Brexit, the gilets jaunes protesters in France, the terrible pain inflicted on Greece and the support for the LeagueFive Star government in Italy all tell their own story. Europe is alive with political discontent that reflects the demand for deep and urgent reform, but the chances of getting it are less likely if the status quo prevails.Why? Because the forces of conservatism are strong. Change comes about only when the pressure for it becomes too great to resist. The financial crisis provided one such opportunity to reform an economic system that for many people clearly wasn’t working Brexit was a second. The left’s case for Brexit has always been based on the following notions: the current economic model is failing socialism is needed to fix it and the free-market ideology hardwired into the EU via the European Central Bank, judgments of the European court of justice and treaty changes will make that process all but impossible without a break with the status quo.It is theoretically possible that in the event of a “Brexit in name only” or no Brexit at all, policymakers will push ahead with what’s needed in order to make a reality of the slogan “a reformed Britain in a reformed Europe”. Possible but not all that plausible, given that it would require breaking up the euro, more autonomy for inidual countries to intervene in the running of their economies, and a simultaneous philosophical U-turn in the big member states.Much more likely is that the pressure for change will dissipate and the real grievances of those who voted for Brexit will be quietly forgotten. The softer the Brexit, the more convinced the EU will be that it has been doing the right thing all along. Britain will not go up in flames, but there will still be consequences. Leave voters will feel they have been victims of an establishment stitch-up. The anger will not go away and will eventually resurface.The risk is that the losers will be the biggest supporters of the EU – the liberal left.

That’s what eBay founder Pierre Omidyar listed from his living room in San Jose back in 1995 to see if his fledgling online marketplace, then called AuctionWeb, would catch on. To his utter amazement a bidding war ensued and the bust $1 item sold for $14.83, seemingly proving Omidyar’s belief that trading is a basic human impulse. The site’s growth was meteoric, with profits doubling month after month, and today it’s a multi-billion-dollar business. But, though these days eBay sees its fair share of mega-money transactions, the beating heart of the company is still those humble sales – from a broken laser pointer to Beanie Babies, well-thumbed paperbacks, fidget spinners and Justin Timberlake’s half-eaten French toast.VirginNow a billionaire business mogul who actually owns an island, Virgin founder Richard Branson was still in short trousers when he first showed a knack for buying and selling. As a boy living in Tanyards Farm in Yorkshire, Branson roped in a school pal to help him plant 400 Christmas trees. He hoped to make £800 profit once they’d grown two years later and the friends agreed to share the cash. His plans were scuppered, however, when rabbits overran the plot, decimating all but a couple of sorry looking sprigs. Undeterred, he found a rather vengeful way to claw back some profit – and pride – by successfully hunting the rabbits and selling them to his local butchers for a shilling each. Not quite the boyhood fortune he’d hoped for, but from little acorns did megastores and jumbo jets grow.IkeaThink of Sweden’s most famous export and Ikea tends to trump even Abba. But the late founder of the furniture giant started small – tiny, in fact. To help his family make ends meet in the remote farming region they called home, Ingvar Kamprad became rural Sweden’s answer to Del Boy. Aged just five, he flogged matches to neighbours, before moving on to seeds, fountain pens, lighters and nylons. Aged 17, Kamprad’s father gave him some money for doing well in school. He used it to launch Ikea, an abbreviation of Ingvar Kamprad from Elmtaryd, Agunnaryd – his boyhood home. Realising he could sell furniture at a lower price if customers had to put in some of the work by assembling it themselves, the flat pack was born, and world domination was in the bag.Jo MaloneThe brains behind those distinctive scented candles in the covetable cream and black boxes had a passion for fragrance from year dot. The daughter of a beautician, as a little girl Jo Malone concocted her own perfumes from grated soap and the flowers in the family’s garden. Later, working as a florist, she gave facials in the evenings from her kitchen using her homemade creams. After giving her Nutmeg \u0026amp Ginger Bath Oil to customers, orders started rolling in – she knew she was on to something. Armed with a couple of saucepans, four plastic jugs and bucket-loads of ideas, she invented fragrances with striking combinations, such as her signature scent Lime Basil \u0026amp Mandarin. Opening her first shop in 1994, Malone eventually sold her fragrance empire to Estée Lauder in 1999 for an undisclosed sum, staying on as creative director and chair until the French cosmetics giant acquired her remaining stake in the company in 2006. But it wasn’t long before Malone returned to her passion – by 2011 she had launched Jo Loves, a new fragrance brand.Forever 21Forever 21 co-founders Don Won Chang and his wife Jin Sook are a bona fide case of rags to riches – in the rag trade. In 1981 the young Korean couple landed in LA in search of the American dream, but they didn’t find it where they were expecting. Having worked in coffee shops growing up, Don was sure roasted beans would lead to his pot of gold. In fact, it was a canny observation he made while serving coffee that saw the couple go from stony broke to billionaires. Don noticed that his customers with the flashiest cars were people in the garment industry and a lightbulb came on. The couple opened a discount store in 1984, raking in $700,000 in the first year and now bring in roughly $4.4bn in sales from 600 stores worldwide.Annie MaloneAnnie Malone’s achievements would be impressive by today’s standards, but they’re positively staggering given her start in life. Born in 1869 to former slaves, Malone founded the black cosmetics industry at the beginning of the 19th-century by inventing her own line of non-damaging hair products, with the aim of providing a better straightening solution for African American women. Calling her first product Wonderful Hair Grower, Malone drummed up custom by selling door-to-door in her home territory of St Louis before expanding to the point that, by 1917, she opened a vast training facility called Poro College – complete with a manufacturing plant, cosmetics store, gym, auditorium, bakery, chapel and roof garden. Eventually she employed 75,000 Poro agents, including fellow philanthropist Madam CJ Walker, at franchises all over the world. The first black female millionaire, Malone gave most of her money to her community, and was president of the board of directors of an orphanage, among her many charitable endeavours.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Copies seen by the  reveal inspectors’ concerns about a wide range of issues, including safeguarding, bullying and lack of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities.The Frome report accuses leaders and governors of failing to provide pupils with a safe and effective education, due to a lack of understanding about the current statutory requirements.It says the school failed to address serious issues that “put pupils at risk of harm” it says some behaviour management is “disproportionate and unsafe” and safeguarding is “not effective”. The inspection team, which visited in November, also raised concerns about a high number of exclusions, most of which were for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities.The report for Bristol, which is also due to be published imminently, similarly details concerns about safeguarding. “Pupils are exposed to avoidable risk of harm,” it says. “Physical intervention is used unnecessarily.” It adds that bullying incidents are too frequent, and disadvantaged pupils and those with special educational needs make insufficient progress.The damning assessments follow similar findings at the Exeter Steiner academy – another state-funded school – which is being transferred to a multi-academy trust after being found inadequate by Ofsted. The fourth state-funded Steiner school, in Hereford, was judged good.The wave of inspections have prompted some parents to complain of a “witch hunt” against Steiner schools. At Bristol, parents have been told the board of governors have sent a legal letter to Ofsted, challenging the inspection report and the inspection process.The school refused to comment on the Ofsted report until publication, but principal Joss Hayes said: “We take the judgements in the Ofsted inspection very seriously and have already acted on many of its findings. We have implemented additional training for all staff and are committed to ensuring that the school makes improvements in key areas.”Frome is also planning to challenge the report and the inspection process. A spokesman for the trustees said: “When the government endorsed Steiner education in the state system and approved Steiner Academy Frome to open as a free school back in 2012, it was an acknowledgement of the importance of choice and creativity within the education system. Clearly this struck a chord for many families within the community, and continues to do so.”Both schools will go into special measures and multi-academy trusts will be sought to take over. Parents fear that the Steiner ethos – the very reason they chose those schools for their children – will be lost in the process.One Frome parent said the Ofsted report did not reflect her experience of the school in any way. “Our experience of the school has been very positive. We see how happy our children are every day and what great progress they are making.“I don’t have any concerns about safeguarding. I’m confident the school will make any changes they need to. For us the key thing is that the Steiner ethos and curriculum are not lost.”Another Frome parent, who rejected the inadequate judgement from Ofsted (“that’s just not our experience”) said he felt Steiner schools were facing a “hostile” environment. “They offered us the opportunity to have a school with a different approach. It’s not appropriate to now criticise the school for having a Steiner curriculum. That was the deal they made with us when the school started.”Hinds called in November for additional scrutiny of Steiner schools by Ofsted after the chief inspector of schools in England, Amanda Spielman, raised concerns about safeguarding in the sector on the back of two earlier inspections.In a letter to her, Hinds said while there was evidence of effective safeguarding in some Steiner schools in both the state and independent sectors, the incidence of safeguarding issues in the independent Steiner schools appeared to be higher than average for the sector.He commissioned Ofsted to carry out a series of inspections and report back to him at the end of the spring term. Meanwhile, the School Inspection Service – an independent organisation with expertise in Steiner methods, which has in the past inspected private Steiner schools – has now closed.Asked to comment, an Ofsted spokesman said: “The inspection reports speak for themselves.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2baa2f332ce409d96cff4734353f71d8fa6755a3/321_0_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51a181da8abb56c3f1fb88fd791cd120","title":"shattered glass why we need to stop deconstructing our superheroes","story":"M Night Shyamalan’s ambitious yet empty end to his comic book-inspired trilogy should be the last attempt to make faux-intellectual points about big screen heroesThis weekend sees the release of M Night Shyamalan’s Glass, the long-awaited follow-up to his 2000 superhero drama Unbreakable and his 2017 thriller Split. Like Unbreakable, Glass is interested in deconstructing the figure of the comic book superhero (and supervillain), calling attention to the tropes of its own genre while placing them in a larger historical and pseudo-scientific context. But whereas this meta-narrative examination felt fresh and exciting in Unbreakable, it now proves to be an utter bore.That’s because deconstructionism – the form of philosophical and literary analysis that seeks to understand the relationship between a text and its meaning, often by acknowledging andor subverting pre-existing conceptions or structural expectations – has become the modus operandi of superhero movies.The argument could be made that such has been the case since 1989’s Batman. Tim Burton’s gothic vision, alongside Michael Keaton’s neurotic interpretation of the character, may not have comprised a full-on deconstruction, but they both leaned heavily in that direction. (Burton’s second installment, Batman Returns, went one step further, bringing to the fore the heavy undercurrent of kink intrinsic to the superhero mythos.)While this new, darker version of Batman took moviegoing audiences by surprise, loyal comic readers were already well acquainted with him. Starting three years earlier, two ingenious comic scribes had turned the industry upside down with their bold, complex revisionist masterworks. Frank Miller and Alan Moore plucked their heroes from out of the sky and brought them down to street level, in the process placing them in a political context that examined their role in shaping rightwing power fantasies.The revolutionary effect of these books, combined with the success of Burton’s Batman films, might have kicked off a golden age of comic books and comic book movies, but it was not to be. Publishers and artists learned all the wrong lessons from Moore and Miller’s example, focusing primarily on their prurient qualities (graphic violence, sexual explicitness, and a grimy aesthetic), while ignoring their deeper thematic and formalist resonance. In their attempt to appeal to more mature audiences, the industry devolved into puerile adolescence, the effect of which still lingers today.The movies, meanwhile, went hard in the opposite direction. Batman’s crossover success didn’t translate to other characters and properties, and, minus one or two notable exceptions, the adaptations that followed were uniformly awful, so awful that even their core audience of children and teens (never the most discerning of demographics) rejected them. By the time Joel Schumacher drove the Batman franchise into the ground, comic book movies seemed destined to be regulated to the same dung-heap of forgotten schlock as video game movies and softcore porn.Then, in 2000, things changed. Riding the coattails of The Matrix’s CGI spectacle (as well as the sleeper success of fellow Marvel adaptation, Blade), Bryan Singer’s X-Men kicked open the doors of the mainstream and ushered in the era of box office supremacy that comic book and superhero movies hold to this day.If, during those initial years, there was a reluctance on the part of these films to fully embrace their glossy-paged origins, they expressed it by way of ironic signaling – “What would you prefer, yellow dex?” – rather than serious metatextual consideration. Yet 2000 was also the year of Unbreakable, which is centered entirely around the latter.Viewed today, Unbreakable displays a remarkable prescience, especially in the way it connects to a growing public appetite for heroic spectacle in the wake of violent national trauma (stemming, in the film as it would shortly in real life, from a horrific act of terrorism). While the superhero boom predates the September 11 attacks by a little over a year, it shouldn’t strain credulity to suggest a direct link between their preponderance in the years that followed and the state of the national psyche during that same period.Regardless, the fact remains that as soon as superhero films rose to a new prominence they were already busy dissecting themselves, with a number of high-profile examples following Unbreakable’s lead: Ang Lee’s Hulk psychoanalyzed its atomic gods, while Pixar’s The Incredibles domesticated theirs. Christopher Nolan revived the dormant Batman franchise and used it as a framework on which to hang a number of hefty moral and legal considerations brought to bear by the “war on terror” – domestic surveillance, enhanced interrogation, the symbiotic relationship between martial authority and violent insurgency. Bryan Singer moved on to Superman and considered (poorly) what would happen if a god-like protector wished to abandon his post, while Hancock, Kick-Ass and Super all attempted – to varying degrees of success – to show us how a superhero would fare in the “real” world.Then there are the films of Zack Snyder, arguably the pre-eminent (though by no means universally acclaimed) auteur of superhero deconstruction. His run of comic book adaptations (300, Watchmen, Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice League) acknowledge the dreadful existential implications of “metahumans” living in – and tearing their way across – a vulnerable human world, even as they ultimately revel in the wanton carnage on display (it was this cognitive dissonance that made Snyder a good choice to bring Frank Miller’s crypto-fascist vision to the screen, and such a terrible choice to adapt Alan Moore’s scholarly, cosmically minded work).Meanwhile, Marvel became the biggest player in the game by carefully threading the needle between earnestness and irony. The company’s focus on world building didn’t leave much room for deconstruction at the outset, but the films did eventually get around to it. Like Nolan’s Bat films, Avengers: Age of Ultron highlights the self-perpetuating cycle of destruction superheroes bring upon themselves and the world. Captain America: Civil War picks up on this thread, looking at the collateral damage wrought by its heroes’ good intentions, while weighing their right to use unilateral force.All of these films coat themselves in layers of moral ambiguity … right up to their third acts, at which point they drop whatever philosophical and moral quandaries they’ve introduced (the most egregious example being Batman’s one-time-only use of warrantless wiretapping in The Dark Knight), to focus on the final, very expensive set-piece. Good ultimately triumphs (unless it’s the middle entry of a franchise, in which case it might end on a cliffhanger), and any ambiguity is traded in for an easily digestible lesson, usually about sacrifice or humility, or something along those lines.Critics like to compare superhero films to westerns, mostly as a wishful invocation of momento mori (whereas once westerns were the most popular genre of film, they barely get made today if we’re lucky perhaps the same fate could soon befall superhero films), but while this comparison doesn’t quite bear itself out – the number of superhero films released during any given year can’t begin to match the number of westerns produced at the height of their popularity – there is another way in which they are similar. What we tend to think of as classic westerns, your John WayneJohn FordHoward Hawks movies, were actually deconstructions of the genre as audiences had come to recognize it up to that point. Films like Stagecoach, High Noon and The Searches took the white-hatted cowboy hero of our national myth and dusted him up a fair amount. They imbued their characters and stories with a heavy dose of noir-ish cynicism and psychological complexity absent from the original oaters of the silent and early sound era.That about sums up where comic book movies are at the moment, although it’s hard to imagine any corporate-owned, brand name tentpole closing the door on its hero in the same manner that John Ford closes the door on John Wayne at the end of The Searchers (Logan gave a send-off to its namesake, but that was only due to Hugh Jackman retiring from the role, and it’s only a matter of time before Disney reintroduces the character with a different actor playing him).But then, even ignoring the obvious profit motive, why should they? Audiences aren’t demanding any radical revisionism they’re satisfied with things as they are (the box office numbers bear this out) and are more than happy to watch film-makers take apart their favorite IPs … so long as they put them back together by the time the credits roll. It’s only when film-makers don’t fully oblige them in this that a vocal contingency rises up in protest (see Iron Man 3 and Star Wars: The Last Jedi).Ultimately, deconstructionist superhero films almost always revert to the same basic message: we all need to believe in heroes, no matter how flawed they may be. However enjoyable their other qualities (and many of them are enjoyable, even excellent), it’s time to close the door on this form of empty intellectual posturing. These films have shown, time and again, that it’s not self-examination they’re interested in, but self-affirmation.There’s something sadly neurotic about that. Perhaps superhero movies have never gotten over the shame of their yellow dex-ed origins after all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e175d452a5fde1da313efee4b963135603cef66f/0_140_4850_2910/master/4850.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87ebe8a165172e69b072b9c2b141371d","title":"chelsea gonzalo higuain confident signing milan juventus","story":"Chelsea are close to securing the signing of Gonzalo Higuaín from Juventus after submitting a formal offer for the Argentina international.The Premier League club have proposed taking Higuaín on loan until the end of the current season, with a view to making that move permanent on a further 12-month deal. Talks progressed rapidly on Wednesday night after Juve had claimed the Italian Supercoppa with victory over Milan, where the 31-year-old striker has been on loan to date this season, in Jeddah.That temporary deal at San Siro will now be cancelled, with the player, who is on around £170,000-a-week but is keen to rejoin Maurizio Sarri, to discuss personal terms with Chelsea. Juventus are expected to formally confirm Higuain’s departure on Thursday, with the player then likely to fly to London for a medical.Once Juventus have signed off the Higuain deal, Chelsea will sanction Álvaro Morata’s long mooted departure to Atlético Madrid. The Spain striker, who moved to Stamford Bridge in July 2017 for an initial £58m, is expected to re-join the club he began his career as a youth-team player on loan. Chelsea are also in talks with AS Monaco over the sale of Michy Batshuayi, for whom they are attempting to recoup as much as £40m. The Belgium striker is keen on a return to the south of France, where he played previously at Marseille.Chelsea would not normally pursue a player of Higuaín’s age and would instinctively be more inclined to go for Internazionale’s Mauro Icardi as a longer-term solution. But Sarri, in desperate need of a striker familiar with his preferred style of play, has made clear a desire to work again with a forward who set a new Serie A goalscoring record of 36 in 35 games over the season under his stewardship at Napoli. He was subsequently sold to Juve for £79.8m, only to be squeezed out by Cristiano Ronaldo’s arrival in Turin last summer.Meanwhile, Chelsea continue to resist Bayern Munich’s interest in Callum Hudson-Odoi, despite the Bundesliga club having offered £35m for the England youth international forward. Hudson-Odoi, who has yet to make a Premier League start, is keen on a move to Germany having grown frustrated at a perceived lack of senior opportunities and is expected to leave this month. Hasan Salihamidzic, Bayern’s sporting director, has admitted that they are still waiting for a response but remain determined to complete his signing. “I am fully convinced of his abilities, we are in talks with Chelsea,” he said. “We have to find a good mix between young talents and experienced leadership players.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c0d09521ecdb57989860c0838f14112e51f0682/0_0_1048_629/master/1048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=281ded487085f44fd48f915d4248cab4","title":"marcelo bielsa leeds spied every opponent","story":"• Manager says it is not illegal but not necessarily right• Bielsa insists he had no bad intentions or wish to cheatMarcelo Bielsa has admitted Leeds United have spied on all their opponents this season but remains adamant no specific rules were broken and believes he is guilty of stupidity rather than cheating.“I observed all the rivals we played against and watched the training sessions of all opponents,” said the Leeds manager in the course of an extraordinary, unscheduled, press conference cum coaching masterclass at the club’s training headquarters near Wetherby.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Elland Road’s “Spygate” furore is that Bielsa’s Championship leaders have been able to deploy such clandestine tactics undetected for more than half a season.The former Argentina and Chile manager was finally prompted to address the issue last Friday when, shortly before Leeds beat Frank Lampard’s Derby County 2-0 in West Yorkshire, the Midlands club revealed that police had apprehended a suspicious person outside their training ground on Thursday. Bielsa immediately acknowledged he was a member of his backroom staff.Although the man was released without charge, it transpired he had been equipped with pliers, binoculars and disguised clothing. “Cheating is a big word but this is over the line,” said Lampard, who revealed that, before Derby lost 4-1 to Leeds earlier in the season a man was spotted lurking in the bushes outside his training ground. “I’d rather not coach than send people undercover on their hands and knees in the undergrowth,” added the former England midfielder.The Football League and Football Association responded by launching investigations but, given that there are no precise rules governing footballing espionage, it is difficult to see exactly what punishment they can impose on Leeds and Bielsa without stepping into a legal minefield. Even so, the EFL has asked Elland Road executives for their observations and, once a response is received, will decide if there has been a contravention of the League’s charter and whether to issue charges against Leeds andor their manager.If any charges are proven, the League – liasing closely with the FA – believe the “full range of sanctions” could potentially be applied. These range from a slap on the wrist to expulsion from the league, although no one is suggesting that the latter scenario - or a points deduction – are likely.Nonetheless Leeds made a point of issuing a swift, formal, apology to Derby on Saturday and Bielsa has evidently deemed it politic to adopt a conciliatory tone while opting for total honesty.“I’m going to make it easier for the EFL investigation,” said the 63-year-old Argentinian, speaking via a translator. “My behaviour is observed from the most extreme position. By doing this I respect the possible sanctions by the authorities.”Significantly he declined to use the precedent of past incidents of football managers spying on opponents – a practice that, as recently as Friday, he maintained is the norm across South America – as a defence and appeared to accept that a certain moral ambiguity underpinned such subterfuge. “I don’t want to make it easier for me by attacking others,” he said.“Regarding what I’ve done it is not illegal. It’s not specified, described or restrained. It’s not seen as a good thing but it is not a violation of the law. Although not illegal it’s not necessarily the right thing to do. But the wrong things you do are not done with bad intention or an intention to cheat.In the course of the media briefing, Bielsa also treated assembled journalists to a PowerPoint presentation designed to detail how much preparation and analysis he and his staff devote to each opponent - before spies are deployed and their reports compiled.Regardless of information received from undercover operatives, the Leeds manager spends countless hours analysing opponent’s previous matches. Citing Derby as an example, he revealed his research on the exact number of times Lampard had utilised particular formations, which players he had deployed in different positions and the identification of opposing formations they had struggled against.If the underlying message was that Bielsa’s meticulous attention to the small print would almost certainly have helped transport Leeds to the top of the table without any spying, it probably worked.More pertinent though is the question of how lawyers will interpret his actions in relation to EFL Regulation 3.4 which states: “In all matters and transactions relating to the league each club shall behave towards each other club and the league with the utmost good faith.”Then there is the similarly rather woolly EFL Regulation 21 which states that managers must not bring the League or any club into “disrepute.”It seems Bielsa’s answer attributed what had happened to cultural misunderstanding. “If you observe something without authorisation we call it spying,” he said. “I’m going to try and explain I did not have bad intentions. I did not try to get an unfair sporting advantage but I did it because it was not illegal or violating specific laws. But I have to adapt to the habits of English football.”Lampard later admitted he had yet to see Bielsa’s explanation. “It’s a funny one for me because I don’t really want to speak too much,” he said after Derby’s win over Southampton. “I’ve said quite a lot at the weekend. It is what it is now. We all know what’s been happening across the board. It’s a league issue now. It’s our league, it’s every team. So it’s up to them to decide what goes from now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6b8ae70cb1be1e446b14fdee09b00b49b26890/291_107_3746_2248/master/3746.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=528249e3b35f5dec1da9afd3bfd94a4e","title":"monaco nice ligue 1 match report patrick vieira thierry henry","story":"Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira occupied their own intensely involved worlds for almost two hours but, when their first taste of temporary enmity was done, they could look one another in the eye. Both men have influenced far better matches than this Derby de La Côte d’Azur, which conjured up a steady enough stream of flashpoints but laid bare the dearth of quality they must attempt to correct. In the end a draw between two winners kept everyone broadly happy and, in the case of Henry and Monaco, ensured the pressure of a relegation battle gets no graver for now.“It was bizarre,” said Henry of coming up against his ally of so many battles with Arsenal and France. “When I saw him coming out of the dressing room, it was bizarre. We went up the steps together we used to play together and here we were, about to play against each other. So we gave a nod to that but then we got lost in the match.”That was presumably what Henry was talking about behind a nowadays obligatory shielding hand during that walk, which continued as they entered the pitch behind their teams. Vieira could not suppress a grin the two looked more like convivial dog-walking companions than dear friends about to redefine brieflythe terms of their relationship. Soon the dugouts loomed into view a hug and a flurry of camera flashes later it was time to put frivolities on hold.For Henry the fixture was stacked with significance beyond high-profile reunions and the imperative to defeat a local rival. The rancour surrounding his 19th-placed side has hardly abated since he arrived, in contrast to the quietly satisfying progress Nice have made in the top half under Vieira, and the situation was begging for a performance in the image of his playing days.“It’s maybe too early to say that – you will have a better idea later,” a reasonably content Vieira said when asked if the sides had reflected their coaches. It would be a stretch to say Monaco did that to the letter but there were glimpses of a team designed to play with speed and ambition, even if they were dealt a hand by the dismissal of Nice’s Ihsan Sacko in first-half added time. They deserved the equaliser headed just over the line by Benoît Badiashile five minutes after the interval, puncturing the resolve of a Nice side that, moulded from the back by Vieira, finds goals at either end to be a rarity.It is little secret that he has been working with a hand tied behind his back, cajoling a team stripped of the tyros that buccaneered around Europe two seasons ago. Eight of his starting outfielders here were 23 or below, a situation exacerbated by an injury crisis that is slowly easing, and the balance has been all wrong.Cesc Fàbregas is among four new signings intended to correct that but, two hours before the start, he could be found in the labyrinthine depths of this arena giving an introductory press conference rather than heeding pre-match instructions. Players who had not been signed by 7 December, the date from which this fixture was postponed, were not eligible and the youngsters would have to be enlisted again.All the same, they emerged admirably from a game that threatened to encapsulate their troubles. When Allan Saint-Maximin ran through to score on the half-hour, capitalising on sloppy play from Youssef Aït Bennasser and drawing a frustrated reaction from Henry, the script looked wearily familiar. It seemed an even crueller twist had been added 15 minutes from time when, with the game poised at 1-1 and Monaco now asking constant questions, Nice were awarded a penalty via the game’s third VAR review. Diego Benaglio saved Saint-Maximin’s kick and, while the substitute Radamel Falcao struck a post later, by the close it appeared some fortune had come Henry’s way at last.He may need it, and it is an unfamiliar thing to say of someone who has traditionally ruled through excellence. “One thing about Thierry is that he is a winner, a competitor, and that’s one thing you will never be able to take away from him,” Fàbregas had said before taking his seat upstairs. “That’s why I know we are in safe hands.” Henry has always possessed the capacity to set onlookers agog maintaining that aura in Monaco might be his greatest feat yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5f0b13f9ca08b5bceaf0312f480c9e3d00d0d5d/305_0_3195_1917/master/3195.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fff72c34344219548f9b5a3b407c8bb0","title":"southampton derby fa cup third round replay match report","story":"Marcelo Bielsa might have been able to tell everyone this before the game but penalties were required to separate Southampton and Derby in their third-round FA Cup replay. It was Frank Lampard’s side who held their nerve and go through to face Accrington Stanley in the fourth round after Nathan Redmond was the only man to miss in the shootout, the winning kick struck home by the unlikely figure of Richard Keogh.“Ready for my presentation everyone?” said Lampard as he walked into his post-match press conference, making light of Bielsa’s extraordinary 70-minute press conference earlier on Wednesday, in which he revealed he had not only Derby’s training sessions watched but every team they have faced this season.When it was put to him that Bielsa gave the impression he knew more about Derby than their own manager, Lampard said: “Well‚ he gave an impression of himself. I haven’t seen Pep Guardiola give that. I haven’t seen Jürgen Klopp give that. Pochettino give that. They do that sort of thing behind closed doors but they don’t do it to the public. It surprised me, definitely. It’s incredible.”Back at St Mary’s, Derby repeated the trick of the first game, coming from 2-0 behind once more to force extra time and ultimately spot-kicks. Southampton surely thought they had a fourth-round place in the bag after goals from Stuart Armstrong and Redmond, only for the Liverpool loanee, Harry Wilson, to inspire Derby’s comeback, firstly with a goal of his own, then by crossing for Martyn Waghorn to equalise. “I think if you have a 2-0 lead twice over Derby and can’t winthe game,” said Ralph Hasenhüttl, “you don’t deserve to be in the next round.”The first half was a pretty grim exhibition but, when good bits of football did poke through the mist of mediocrity, they were from Derby. One delicious move involved a Matthias Sammer-esque carry out of defence from Keogh, followed by a couple of flicks and back-heels among the forwards, but its deserved finish did not arrive when Mason Mount skied his shot from the edge of the box. Otherwise it was tedious: pity the poor Bielsa assistant who had to compile a dossier on this one.But they sat up straight on 38 minutes, when Derby took the lead. Or, at least they thought they had. Tom Huddlestone slid a fine pass into the box for Waghorn, who laid it off for Craig Bryson to finish neatly. However, VAR was called for and after the sort of forensic, frame-by-frame examination only previously seen by conspiracy theorists watching the Zapruder film, it was determined that the bottom half of Waghorn’s leg was offside. No goal. In the stands the Derby fans sang “Fuck VAR!”but afterwards Lampard was more sanguine.“I think we’ll have to get used to it,” he said. “I don’t mind as long as they get the decision right. Was it right? I haven’t looked closely enough but it looked like it was millimetres.”Then, after the boredom of the first period came a glut of goals in the second. Southampton went ahead after 67 minutes when Shane Long’s header was blocked on the line, only for Armstrong to swoop in and nod the loose ball home.Two minutes later it was two. Redmond timed his run through the middle of the Derby defence perfectly and on the very edge of the defensive line collected Jack Stephens’s pass and delicately chipped over the advancing Kelle Roos.Derby were given hope with 15 minutes remaining. Wilson took a free-kick from the right corner of the box, zipped it into the middle at pace and it went past everyone into the net. “I was just about to take him off,” said Lampard, his second thoughts proving crucial a few moments later. Wilson curled over a cross from the right, and Waghorn found space between two defenders to head into the top corner.Extra time was required, meaning the Prime Minister’s statement in Downing Street was relegated to BBC2 as BBC1 continued to show the game. “They deserve those moments,” said Lampard, of his players. “Theresa May will have many a moment coming up over the next few weeks, I would say.”After a cagey extra 30 minutes came penalties. Redmond was the only player to err, shooting well wide after opening up his body and aiming for the top corner. The other eight kicks were flawless, Derby rushing to celebrate with Keogh at the end of a long night."},{"url":null,"title":"drag queens gaming twitch cosplay","story":"Video games and drag offer potent opportunities to play with identity. Four artists explore personas, avatars and cosplay, taking down trolls on Twitch and the power of Princess Peach Drag in video games is often played for laughs – see 1997’s Final Fantasy VII, in which spiky-haired Cloud Strife dresses as a woman to deceive a gullible, misogynistic mafioso, or Alfred the “cross-dressing freak” from Resident Evil: Code Veronica – but drag and video games can be vectors of identity exploration and self-expression. Drag can involve trying on a persona by putting yourself in someone else’s heels, a subversive form of role-play – and what are video games if not role-play?Gaming has potent power for many queer people, as a space to safely explore what it’s like to be other people (or to be ourselves). Hyper-feminine characters such as Princess Peach, D. Va and Bayonetta have become drag and cosplay icons. And drag queens are visible in many parts of the gaming community, from developers to Twitch streamers. Here, four queens explain how video games have influenced their drag.With the Kitty Powers’ Matchmaker series, I challenged myself to create a game about making people happy. I want people to be able to choose whatever they want to be: an avatar that is like themselves, or something fantastical … like Kitty Powers! My approach was not to make a queer game, but to make a game for everyone that had queer people in it. It’s important to see all humans as equal.Kitty Powers was my one creative outlet and combining drag and video games hadn’t really been done before. It can get a Marmite reaction, but it’s good to provoke people and make them think. I like to think that me expressing myself in my art form is a positive thing and when there’s enough negative energy flying around on the internet, it’s good to bring a bit of fluffiness.It’s interesting how meta it has become, because there aren’t many developers who star in their own game. Kitty Powers is a video game character but also the real person who developed the game, able to appear in productions on YouTube or on stage. I like to connect the dots for fans and explore the live theatricality of drag too.There’s something about the confidence you have when you’re in drag that inspires other people and makes them feel safe. That’s really important when leading a design team. Video games have also helped Kitty Powers go beyond just being a drag queen. She’s all about love, positivity and inclusiveness, so the games have helped to spread that message. I do drag for other people as much as myself.Streaming in drag gave me the chance to practise makeup and do drag at least once a week. I get a positive reaction from most of the people who come to my stream, especially for my Sims drag series. I love The Sims so much because you can create your dream scenario and if you don’t like it, you can just destroy it. I also love Heroes of the Storm – those characters have definitely inspired my drag looks.But I do think drag streamers get a lot more trolls than even LGBT streamers. I’m sure it’s the same for trans streamers as well. Maybe I’m an easy target. They see the big hair and the LGBT tag and it attracts attention. I try to be funny and entertaining and play back with them. But I realise that they’re doing this to get a reaction from me so if I give them that it just encourages them.Personally I don’t take any offence at what they say. Sometimes it’s hilarious. What does affect me, though, is a loss of hope for humanity. There are a lot of people out there that hold these terrible views and I’m exposed to the worst of it all through trolls. But Twitch is very supportive of the LGBT community, and it has a lot of tools to help.When I first started streaming on Twitch, I had no idea how people would react. I thought I was entering this straight world and that, as a gay person, I would be chased out immediately. However, Twitch is full of talented LGBTQA+ streamers, viewers and allies. I am really lucky to have all the friends that I have met through Twitch.It’s scary streaming live on camera, especially as an openly gay person showcasing their drag persona. You open yourself up for hurt but as a creative person you can’t showcase your art without putting it out there. Detractors seldom visit my broadcast, but when they do my stance is to take away their power. I get rude comments but purposely mispronounce them or misunderstand them. And they say I’m not passing for female but I don’t care: I’m a drag queen!The LGBTQA+ community flocks to like-minded people. I like to keep my space welcoming and positive for anyone that decides to visit. I love that I can provide that for my friends and fans.Drag queen performer and hostEvery gay kid can relate to their straight friends playing as Mario or Luigi. I would always pick Princess Peach. The original Erika Klash was conceived as a Princess Peach type character – a queen but not always the damsel in distress. Her gentle nature, her softness and her beauty inspired me but I also wanted to be a sassy, fun drag queen.As I was developing this video game character I knew I wanted to do a lot of cosplay with my drag. I was always interested in putting a twist on a character as a living cartoon, seeing how I could adapt a non-human shape to my body. Nobody was really doing crazy makeup at the bars I was working at, but I became known for it very early on. I’ve used video game music too – I do a number about gonorrhoea and use music from Dr Mario!I produce nerdy shows in New York and San Francisco, like my nerdy punk drag show Pastel Gore. I also participate in Flame Con: an LGBT-focused anime video game convention. There’s always an appetite for gaming drag because I don’t think there are as many places for nerdy queer people as there should be. It’s important to spend time with people that have the same interests and look at the world in the same way. Queer nightlife is very gay male orientated. These days, I see nerds of colour expressing themselves more openly, and I see women participating a lot more, too. It’s important that there are all kinds of people in the line-up so they feel affirmed in their work and feel they can express themselves freely."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bad922adc145af4df009b1005fd20fe78adf890/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89a474f2b048e65edfbdc5d5f4762c76","title":"second brexit referendum mps democracy peoples vote","story":"Leave voters knew what they were doing in 2016. To suggest otherwise is simply elitistRemainers often argue as if they had a monopoly on what counts as reasonable and rational decision-making. Supporting the EU comes from the head whereas wishing to leave the EU comes from the heart, as the MP Rachel Reeves once put it. And yet, the attitude of some towards a second referendum is breathtakingly reckless and cavalier. Almost anything – as long as it brings us one step closer to the UK staying in the EU – is countenanced and justified.I remember one Cambridge lunch, on a day when cabinet ministers were resigning over Theresa May’s deal, in which a colleague told me he would cheer every time a new resignation was announced. The more chaotic the better, he said, because chaos makes shelving Brexit that much more likely.So, many hoping for another vote will have cheered as MPs dramatically voted down the prime minister’s deal last night. Yet making a second vote happen would require tearing up much of what we consider to be the elementary workings of British parliamentary democracy. Since the June 2016 referendum, MPs have repeatedly voted in support of the result, in the name of implementing a decision taken by a majority of the electorate. Many seem to forget that between the original Brexit vote and today, we had a general election. Conservative and Labour parties both committed themselves in their manifestos to implementing the referendum result. Only the Liberal Democrats could say that they opposed Brexit in an election that saw them pick up only a handful more seats than the catastrophic 2015 election. The same happened over the so-called “great repeal bill”, the legislation required to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, when MPs rejected an amendment calling for a referendum on whether to support the deal or remain in the EU.For the House of Commons to endorse a second referendum, it would have to repeal past Brexit legislation in a manner that flouts the position adopted by the main parties in the last general election. Were this to happen, it would tear up established relations between executive and legislature, pitting popular and parliamentary sovereignty against one another. Parliament would in effect be seeking, in a Brechtian fashion, to dissolve “the people” and put another in place that will vote differently in a second referendum.Why should it not be possible to change one’s mind in a democracy? Of course it should be, but calls for a second referendum have very little to do with a changing of minds and more to do with a hardening of views. What lies behind the call for another vote is a belief that those who voted to leave in June 2016 should change their minds. The fact that its supporters call it “the people’s vote”, as if the first vote wasn’t, lets the cat out of the bag. Driving the desire to have a second vote is a firm belief that the first one was an illegitimate act, a subversion of democratic politics that saw a leave victory  achieved through a mix of lies and misconceptions.This soft Brexit compromise has been championed by the former Conservative minister Nick Boles as a plan B for leaving the European Union.It is based on Norway’s relationship with the EU, which is outside the bloc and the customs union but inside the single market. Under the plan the UK would have to join Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland in the European Free Trade Association (Efta), which would then allow it to participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).The ‘plus’ in this option refers to a temporary customs union with the EU, which would need to be negotiated to avoid a hard border ion the island of Ireland. The temporary arrangement would remain in place until the EU and UK agreed a specific trade deal.The option has the advantage of being as close to the EU as possible without full membership, and it would do away with the need for a problematic backstop for Northern Ireland. Like Norway, the UK would be outside the common fisheries and agriculture policies, and would not be subject to the European court of justice.But it crosses a key red line for Brexiters by continuing freedom of movement, one of the preconditions of single market membership. It would also limit the UK ability to negotiate its own trade deals while a new customs arrangement is under discussion. And it would require continued financial contributions to the EU without an influence inside the bloc.This is what the second referendum campaigners hang their arguments on, so it merits some scrutiny. At the heart of it is an epistemic claim: people did not understand what was at stake and now that they do, we should give them a chance to vote differently. Instead of basing our political system on two fundamental principles – equal political rights (for those over 18) and majority rule – this claim introduces a new element, knowledge. It presumes that people who voted leave first time around were ignorant or misguided, or both. It also suggests that one’s right to act politically rests in part upon one’s ability to be informed about the issues in question.Who can determine whether people are well enough informed to allow a result to pass? Do advocates of this kind of knowledge-based democracy accept that access to knowledge is fundamentally shaped by social and economic power? Thus organised, we ide our political world into those who know and those who do not. Or, more truthfully, between those who are sure that they know and those who are not so sure. This is a subjective difference, requiring an arbiter to draw the line. As things stand, the only arbiters at present are MPs themselves, who we know are made up predominantly of remainers. Would we instead create an independent body, made up of the great and the good, empowered to decide on the cognitive capacities of voters? I imagine not, but the elitism underpinning arguments for a second referendum couldn’t be clearer.If a second referendum would have such a corrosive effect on British parliamentary democracy, why are we even considering it? The answer to this lies once again with parliament. Though we now know that there is an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons who reject May’s deal, and a likely majority against “no deal”, there is no majority on anything else. The only practical alternative floated thus far is “Norway plus” which, if compared with May’s deal, is a radical step away from Brexit.The great convenience of a second referendum for MPs is that it absolves them of all responsibility. Rather than making hard choices themselves, MPs could simply pass them back to the electorate. Recently, we have heard a lot of fancy talk about parliament taking back control over Brexit a second referendum would be quite the opposite and that is what makes it a likely outcome.A second referendum would be a blow to the heart of our parliamentary democracy. It would introduce the principle – elitist to the core – that the legitimacy of a political decision rests upon a judgment about the knowledge that informed it. And it would rely on a dirty plebiscitarianism as a way out of the political impasse in Westminster. Those arguing for a second referendum should be careful what they wish for. Chaos is rarely a harbinger of good outcomes.• Chris Bickerton teaches politics at Cambridge University"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5452df66265abe407ba2027a23962c3c3958e4/0_327_6091_3655/master/6091.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc1002507f2f62aecaf203b416d7f9b7","title":"giving london a brum for its money a locals guide to birmingham","story":"Britain’s second city is a erse cultural hub and on the radar as a global destination in its own right. Who better than resident Tom Cullen to show us around?The paint-by-numbers introduction to an article about the best things to do in Birmingham might go something like this: “Everyone thought Birmingham was a bit crap but great news, we’re wrong!”Brummies acknowledge this backhanded compliment with a trademark shrug and a wry smile. And then they move on. But this line of thinking perpetuates the theory that the city is merely improving, which is nonsense. It’s gone far beyond that, becoming a bonafide global destination for visitors and, perhaps more importantly, an unsurpassable home for more than a million people.So much was happening here that I turned my back on a 12-year career in London’s magazine business to launch a title dedicated to Birmingham.So, where to begin? How about on arrival at Bonehead, just 60 seconds from the new-look New Street station. A beer and chicken spot just off the rejuvenated John Bright Street, Bonehead is furnished with wooden benches, street art and fly posters, and its cooks possess quite a skill for deep-frying bird and dousing it in fiery Nashville sauces or cooling Korean kimchee. I eat alone there with somewhat worrying regularity.Eight minutes north by foot is Ikon Gallery, the immaculate neo-gothic former Oozells Street Board School. The Japanese cherry blossoms that decorate the square on which it and its exquisite tenant, Yorks Cafe, sit are months from bloom, but the building – which comes complete with a singing lift – brings a Hogwartsian beauty to Brindleyplace. Haroon Mirza’s mind-bending Reality is Somehow What We Expect it to Be is Ikon’s current feature exhibition, on show from now until 24 February 2019.Ikon doesn’t just stick to its own Grade II-listed walls, but makes a virtue of teaming up with other interesting locations across the city (venue collaboration is something of a Brum tradition). Right now, the Ikon team is working with Medicine Bakery and Gallery to exhibit Procession Banners – the result of artist Lucy Orta’s collaboration with female prisoners at HMP Downview to design 30 banners to mark 100 years since women won the vote. It’s on until 20 January 2019, and you can grab the city’s best cronut from the beautiful little bakery on your way in.Ikon’s near-neighbour, the Rep, is the longest-established of Britain’s building-based theatre companies and its productions are of the calibre you would expect with that in mind. Head there with the kids to catch award-winning director Liam Steel’s reimagining of The Wizard of Oz, which runs until 13 January or schedule in a visit for June 2019, when the indomitable Sir Ian McKellen brings his remarkable solo show to the theatre.The Hippodrome, the UK’s most popular single-auditorium theatre, is home to the Birmingham Royal Ballet, currently performing the Nutcracker to packed-out audiences. If you’re going, stop by at Gaijin for pre or post-show sushi. It’s a restaurant that the ’s own Jay Rayner recently waxed lyrical about, putting at least one nail in the theory that Birmingham has no decent mid-range restaurants. Hit up Harborne Kitchen (try the wagyu lasagne) or the new Nocturnal Animals for similar-priced eats. And of course, for those looking to spend a little more there are plenty of Michelin-starred restaurants: Simpsons and Purnell’s to name a couple.I pedal every weekday through Cannon Hill park, a space with beauty every bit as arresting as London’s major parks, and it always warms me, even in the frosty months, to see the multicultural mix of people jogging or dog-walking, or simply sitting on a bench and being in Birmingham. My kids love this place, almost as much the new Legoland Discovery Centre, or “Nemo spotting” at the National Sea Life Centre and gooning around with the interactive water features of ThinkTank’s Science Garden.ThinkTank is part of Birmingham Museums Trust: eight historical venues (including Aston Hall, Sarehole Mill and Soho House) that play contrary to the theory that Birmingham demolishes its most beautiful buildings.And of course, we have history – an abundance of it. Our town hall has hosted notable speakers such as Joseph Chamberlain, Charles Dickens and Clement Atlee. Continuing its history of erse content, it hosted the contentious Jordan B Peterson last month, three days before the less contentious Fun DMC, the UK’s only family-friendly block party. Mountaineer Chris Bonnington is in town on 5 December, and the Birmingham Town Hall and Symphony Hall is teaming up with the Hare \u0026amp Hounds, one of the city’s best pubs and music venues, to host local jazz saxophonist Soweto Kinch, on 6 December. Kinch regularly puts his name to the Flyover Show, an almost annual music, art and dance event that celebrates black culture in Birmingham.My office is based in the Victorian-era Great Western Arcade. Shoppers regularly wander in looking for the Georgian Piccadilly Arcade, and vice versa. It’s one of Birmingham’s charming mix ups, like not knowing in the 80s which shopping centre was the Pavilions and which one was the Pallasades. Whichever arcade you’re in, you’ll discover independent traders – the best in their respective fields – cutting hair, carving sandwiches and pouring coffee.The Balti Triangle, a name that should be known globally, seems eye-wateringly overlooked as a tourist destination. Someone’s failure to signpost it, front and centre, from New Street station, really rips my naan bread. It’s the beating heart of Birmingham, which is the beating heart of Britain, and it deserves the sort of visitor numbers that the now American-owned Cadbury World attracts regularly .Just south of town (and we always call it “town”, never “the city centre”) sits Digbeth, often dubbed “the Shoreditch of Birmingham” (never by a Brummie, though – we refuse to piggyback). Digbeth’s just Digbeth to us, and that’s how we like it. Home to Dig Brew Co, a brewery that admittedly would fit nicely in east London, and the Clean Kilo, the UK’s largest zero-waste supermarket. In October, the Sunday Times called Digbeth the coolest neighbourhood in Britain. Digbeth, greeted the compliment in typical Birmingham style. It gave a wry smile. Shrugged.

It is only making this more complex.”Baeidinejad also accused Ratcliffe of lying when he claimed that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had offered his wife freedom a month ago if she agreed to act as a spy for Iran in the UK. He insisted: “We want to help her and approach this from a humanitarian point of view.”The relatively rare briefing by the ambassador could either be taken as a sign that the Iranians are rattled by the high-profile campaign being mounted by the Zaghari-Ratcliffes, or a genuine attempt to persuade Richard Ratcliffe to lower the profile of his campaign, and so make it easier for clemency to be granted.The ambassador said that any convicted prisoner subject to a jail sentence of under 10 years could be released after serving a third of their sentence on the recommendation of the prison to the prosecutor general, so long as the inidual was not deemed to be a threat to society or likely to reoffend.Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to five years in jail more than two years ago and would therefore now be eligible for release.Referring to her chances of clemency, Baeidinejad said: “I will let you judge if the person involved is in good conduct and is helping and assisting the prison authorities.”Baeidinejad’s intervention came as the Free Nazanin campaign said she had been allowed to call her husband to tell him of the end of her hunger strike, which she undertook along with a fellow prisoner.Zaghari-Ratcliffe lost 3kg over the three days she was on hunger strike and suffered increasing dizziness and a constant headache, the campaign group said. Richard Ratcliffe said: “The past few days have been really stressful. I never thought three days could pass so long.”Thanking Hunt for his intervention in summoning the Iranian ambassador on Monday, he added: “I am really glad this is over – I am still sorry it came to this, that Nazanin felt there was no other way. But I hope now those permissions mean that Nazanin will now get the medical attention she needs.”Baeidinejad also urged Hunt to lower the profile of the case, saying: “Our function as diplomats is to try to resolve this is in a manner so that the UK and Iranian people would feel it has been handled with vigilance and care. We are doing our best to approach this from a humanitarian way and not linked to the nuclear issue or any other deal. It should be considered on its own merits.”He said it was outrageous that the foreign secretary had suggested that Zaghari-Ratcliffe was being used as a diplomatic pawn as part of a wider Iranian attempt to force the British pay a 45-year-old debt arising from the Iranian purchase of Chieftain tanks.He said: “We condemn this kind of statement as outrageous and unacceptable. She has received a verdict of the judge that she deserves to be in prison and that is the law, and this law should be applied to any Iranian.”Richard Ratcliffe said on Wednesday: “I think that’s dangerously close to blaming the victim. The idea that a legal system defines its imprisonment based on how a family campaigns from the outside is extraordinary.“There are a number of Iranian dual-nationals being held by Iran. There is no obvious pattern between those who are quiet and those who are noisy. We will keep Nazinin in the spotlight, and I told the Revolutionary Guards that before we went public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4ee253dc087211769b160d35508e8564476ffed/1312_21_3136_1882/master/3136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd001213f9a7e63163f7910188cb27cb","title":"how a deluge of money nearly broke the premier league","story":"It’s the world’s most lucrative football league. But a civil war over all that money almost toppled itBy  Jonathan Clegg and  Joshua RobinsonThe Premier League offices in London’s West End are located mostly underground. This fact alone does not make them exceptional in the world of football administration – Fifa’s lair in Zurich features five subterranean levels, including a sinister conference room ripped straight out of Dr Strangelove. But the Premier League isn’t going for the futuristic bunker vibe. Nothing about it exudes Bond-villain hideout or military robotics lab. What makes the place remarkable is its modesty. Premier League HQ feels more like the offices of a mid-sized legal practice.Blending into a row of elegant Georgian buildings with white fronts and black railings, the exterior of the Premier League offices at 30 Gloucester Place is marked only by a small silver plaque. Where it publishes its address, the Premier League points out that access is “by appointment only”. The few people who ever stop to take pictures are the tabloid photographers working the pavement whenever the Premier League managers gather for their league-wide meetings – think photos of middle-aged men in ill-fitting suits emerging from black cabs.When the league moved into the space in 2005, domestic TV rights had just cleared the billion-pound mark for the second successive cycle. Ratings were through the roof. Yet for the most popular league on the planet, the offices have none of the ostentation or scale of, for instance, the NFL’s, perched high above the corner of 51st Street and Park Avenue in New York, or the NBA’s, which are in a skyscraper two avenues over. In part, that’s because the Premier League has roughly 10 times fewer employees than the NFL or NBA, with a head count hovering around 110.Visitors to the home of the world’s most popular league are led downstairs to a small waiting area where the sofas are pointed at the Premier League trophy and a tea station. The atmosphere is one of quiet, businesslike efficiency. Until his resignation this winter, the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, kept a spartan office here, as do the aides who make sure that contracts are up to date, partners are kept happy, and the league’s extensive charity operations tick over smoothly. Scudamore, the Premier League’s highest-paid executive, earned a basic salary in the low seven figures – news of the £5m “golden handshake” he received on his way out caused a brief furore in December. But compare that to the $34m that NFL commissioner Roger Goodell earned in 2016, or the roughly $20m the NBA is believed to pay commissioner Adam Silver, and you wonder why the Premier League – for all of the cash flooding into its clubs – makes its brass look so unassuming.The reason is that the Premier League is a much smaller sporting government than any of its US counterparts. It is first and foremost a media-rights-selling organisation that happens to provide 20 clubs with a platform, referees and a ball. The organisation has six league-wide sponsors – no more – in obvious categories such as official timekeeper and official snack, and a ball contract with Nike that has quietly hummed along since 2000. The NFL, by contrast, had 32 league-wide sponsors in 2015, including an official soup.The most profitable sporting organisation to come out of England isn’t in the business of peddling merchandise either. It won’t sell you a baseball cap or scarf – it leaves that entirely to the clubs. The Premier League’s website does not even have an shop. That’s why the whole operation can be happily contained in a single office that almost nobody knows is there. But ever since 2005, that humble residence at Gloucester Place has served as mission control for the Premier League’s quest for global domination.By the time Scudamore was introduced chief executive in 1999, he could tell the Premier League was already on its way to becoming a domestic juggernaut. Sky had renegotiated its contract for UK TV rights a couple of years earlier, agreeing to pay £670m over four years, more than doubling the value of its previous deal. When Scudamore looked at the international revenues, though, he saw a world of untapped potential. The league’s overseas broadcast rights had sold for just £98m in 1997, a figure Scudamore regarded not merely as disappointing but borderline disrespectful. In his mind, the Premier League was the most exciting football competition on the planet. It was time it got paid like it.His first order of business was overhauling the way the league sold itself abroad. Until then, it had auctioned off its overseas rights package en bloc for a fixed fee, with the winning bidder then free to unpackage those rights and resell them in different countries and territories as they saw fit. He wanted to cut out the middleman and negotiate with broadcasters himself. Scudamore was a man who liked to be in the room. He immediately told the club owners that they stood a better chance of finally raking in what they were worth by breaking up the overseas rights into separate territorial packages and dealing face-to-face with the TV companies. Convinced by his commercial background, the owners signed off on Scudamore’s proposal to become their ambassador to the world.Figures like those would have been inconceivable to the men who founded the Premier League in 1992. They had so underestimated the global appetite that, in the early years of their enterprise, they were the ones paying foreign broadcasters to carry their games, not the other way around. The clamour for rights packages from every corner of the planet now convinced them otherwise.As Scudamore gradually shaped his role into that of a globetrotting executive, making visits to key markets including India, Thailand, Singapore and the Middle East during each new season, he realised that the Premier League product was equipped with a host of built-in advantages. These factors, so obvious in retrospect, meant that fans around the world were predisposed to the Premier League even before they realised it. Best of all, those advantages were a total coincidence. The league had nothing to do with their existence.The first – and most forehead-slappingly simple – is that this whole show takes place in English. While Italy’s Serie A and Germany’s Bundesliga must first help viewers make sense of names like Sampdoria and Borussia Mönchengladbach, one-quarter of the world’s population can tune in to a Premier League and immediately understand what’s happening – even if it means occasionally wading into the absurdly tedious “soccer v football” debate. (For the record, soccer, like football, is an originally British term short for “association football”.) Beyond the language, the league also benefits from its location. As countless London firms have discovered, the fact that the British business day overlaps with both Asian and American daytime hours gave the league a leg up on rival sports organisations, including the NFL and the NBA.A Premier League match that kicks off in the early afternoon can be consumed both as primetime Saturday-night entertainment in Singapore and over a bowl of Cheerios on a Saturday morning in Brooklyn. On top of all of this, it was obvious to Scudamore that overseas viewers had a sort of natural Anglophilia – and were gravitating to the heritage and culture of English football, its authenticity. In short, they craved the Britishness of it all. “Being British is the essence of what we are,” Scudamore told the Times in 2013. “It’s a bit like being the Queen or the BBC.”By the end of his first decade as chief executive, Scudamore had parlayed that headstart into tenfold increase in the value of the league’s international TV rights. Now he had to add some creativity of his own. To keep global rights fees rising, it was no longer enough simply to cut out the middleman and deal with international broadcasters directly. He needed to sell them on the idea that the Premier League rights they had just paid through the nose for were indispensable to their business model. And to do that, Scudamore developed two clear strategies.The first relied on Scudamore’s own talents as a salesman – or, to be more specific, what one Premier League owner described as his talent for “creating tension” at the negotiating table, never letting buyers get too comfortable. If that gives the impression of Scudamore as a sales shark sniffing out weaknesses and exploiting them to push his product, the reality could not be more different. In fact, Scudamore created the most fiendish auction process in world sports by running the league’s sales department with the sort of folksy, homespun charm of a village post office.He purposely kept his sales team to roughly a half-dozen employees so that broadcasters felt a personal connection when they rang Gloucester Place. And the mantra they lived by was less “always be closing” and more “always be courteous”. Scudamore’s unshakeable sense of decorum taught him that politeness was the key to preserving customer relationships. At the end of every season, he personally emailed thank-you notes to the league’s 80 international broadcasters and sent special goodbye messages to those whose contracts with the league had expired. Scudamore also began to accompany the prime minister on trade missions, taking the Premier League trophy with him. “Everyone who sees the trophy will say, ‘Wow’, he explained. “Heads of state, prime ministers – they all want a photo with the trophy. It’s what we like to call soft power.”For two decades, Richard Scudamore’s professional life had been more or less smooth sailing. He promised the 20 owners of the Premier League that he would sell their game around the world, and for 20 years, that’s what he did. But after all of that peaceful coexistence between the clubs, during which English football’s biggest institutions had made money hand over fist, built towering new stadiums, attracted huge global fan bases and transformed themselves into billion-dollar businesses, the Premier League gravy train came to an unexpected standstill in 2018, just as Britain’s trains are wont to do.For the first time in a quarter of a century, it became apparent that England’s top flight – once a model of collective harmony and mutual benefit – was racked by ision of its own the Premier League had split into a morass of feuding factions that were each blaming somebody else for threatening to blow the whole thing up. The big six clubs wanted a larger slice of the pie. The other 14 felt left behind. And the original, 1992 formula for redistributing income – the very thing that underpinned the league’s wild growth – was being challenged.The simmering tensions were mostly kept behind closed doors, in club boardrooms, in executive boxes and in the conference rooms of swanky hotels. Outwardly, it appeared that the Premier League was a picture of strength. The league was resurgent on the European stage, qualifying a record five clubs for the Champions League’s last 16, while negotiations over the latest sale of domestic TV rights meant the clubs were in line for another windfall.But amid this outbreak of unseen hostility, there was one surprise. It turned out that the biggest agitator was the one club that seemingly had the least to worry about. Not content with laying waste to English football on the pitch, Manchester City and its Catalan-Emirati leadership were pushing to overturn the league’s way of doing business.In official league meetings and private discussions with other clubs, City railed against the league’s revenue-sharing model and repeatedly challenged the age-old Founder Members Agreement – a document handwritten in 1991 by Rick Parry, the first Premiership chief executive, that held the status of Premier League scripture. The reality is that when it was written up, no one paid much attention to the overseas income. In fact, the league was losing money on international broadcasts back then as it was paying foreign networks to carry its games. “Nobody envisaged that it would be as big as it is, so sharing those rights equally was a concession they thought wouldn’t matter,” Parry said.The way Manchester City saw it, the Founder Members Agreement was more like a relic that belonged in a glass case with acid-wash jeans, the Sega Mega Drive and other treasured artifacts of the 1990s. The league’s antique formula and its quaint, old-fashioned ideas about competitive balance had allowed the Premier League to become the richest purveyor of the world’s favourite sport. But for a club like Manchester City – whose modern history dated back to only 2008, when it was bought by the Emirati billionaire Sheikh Mansour – that was all in the distant past.In truth, no one should have been shocked to learn that City gave little thought to the overall strength of the league. The club’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, had telegraphed exactly those sentiments a decade earlier in his book about running Barcelona. Midway through a meditation on the differences between professional sport in the US and football in Europe, Soriano laid out his thoughts about the concept of competitive balance.If anything, Soriano’s conviction was even stronger now. The Premier League’s top clubs – like his – needed a greater share of the wealth if they were ever to hope of luring the world’s best players back to England.That much had been made clear to Soriano during the previous summer’s transfer window. It wasn’t that City lacked the funds to compete at the top end of the transfer market, of course. No team in world football spent more in 2017 than the £221.5m of Sheikh Mansour’s fortune that Soriano plunked down on five new recruits for Pep Guardiola’s squad. They weren’t the only big spenders in the Premier League either. In sum, English clubs splurged more than £1.4bn in transfer fees. That was all well and good. The issue for Soriano was that the summer’s headline moves for the best players and the biggest fees had not involved Manchester City. Nor had they involved Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool or any other English club for that matter. The juiciest transfer of the summer belonged to a different superpower in a different league controlled by a different Gulf state. Paris Saint-Germain, backed by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, blew a world-record €222m on the fleet- footed, flamboyantly coiffed Brazilian Neymar from Barcelona.If that wasn’t bad enough, just a few weeks later, the French teenager widely tipped to be the game’s next global superstar, an 18-year-old forward named Kylian Mbappé, had moved from Monaco for the second-highest transfer fee on record. He had signed for PSG, too.For Soriano, this was a galling development. It was one thing if English clubs had to defer to Real Madrid or Barcelona when it came to signing the game’s most prized players. The two Spanish superclubs had their domestic championships on lockdown, as did Bayern Munich. Players who signed there knew they could spend most of the season beating up on the weaklings that made up the rest of the league, allowing them to conserve energy for the occasional big game, the later rounds of the Champions League, and the serious business of lifting a big trophy above their heads.By contrast, English football was a grind. So Soriano couldn’t blame the likes of Messi and Ronaldo if they chose to spend their careers somewhere more comfortable. But there are only so many world-class players to go around. If Paris Saint-Germain were getting in on the act now, too, that was a problem. And in football, there’s only one surefire way to solve a problem. Soriano knew that if he threw enough money at them, the world’s best players could be persuaded to move to Manchester. Premier League clubs were making more than enough cash for him to do so he just needed to ensure a greater share of it flowed into Manchester City’s coffers at the expense of clubs at the wrong end of the table. It made perfect sense to him. If English football wanted to attract the world’s best players, then who could argue?When Manchester City reached the midpoint of the 201718 campaign with an insurmountable lead at the top of the table, it seemed that the rest of the season might turn into one long victory lap. But if that suggested a Premier League season devoid of suspense, the reality was far different. There was still intrigue, tension and drama out there. You just had to know where to look. For example, in the dining rooms of hip Manhattan restaurants. On a warm night in the middle of October 2017, an incongruous group of diners sat down to eat among the dark wood tables and black leather banquettes at Locanda Verde, a high-end Italian eatery in Tribeca.The group of old white guys with not much hair between them didn’t turn many heads amid the usual gaggle of well-tanned, well-Botoxed VIPs. But if anyone with a keen knowledge of English football executives had passed their table on the way to the toilet, they would have recognised that this party represented the most unlikely gathering of enemies since the heads of New York’s mafia families held their regular meetings in red-sauce joints to keep the peace. Around the table that night were Joel and Avram Glazer, the owners of Manchester Utd, along with the club’s chief executive, Ed Woodward Liverpool’s principal owner John W Henry and Ivan Gazidis, then the chief executive of Arsenal.That these clubs had ended up brushing off more than a century of mutual loathing to sit down to dinner together was due to an emerging crisis that concerned all of them. Over the previous 12 months, the Premier League’s “big six” had jointly reached the conclusion that the exorbitant sums the league were now raking in from the sale of overseas TV rights – currently worth £3.3bn – should no longer be distributed equally among the league’s 20 teams as they had been since the Premier League was first founded 25 years earlier.The way the big six saw it, some clubs deserved a larger share – specifically, them. After all, they were the ones responsible for the league’s explosive global popularity, weren’t they? They were the ones criss-crossing the planet every summer to raise the profile of English football, the ones who boasted of absurd global followings in the hundreds of millions, driving international viewership from Trondheim to Tierra del Fuego. It was only right that they should be compensated accordingly. Nobody in the US or Asia was wrenching themselves out of bed early or staying up late to watch bloody Bournemouth. Unfortunately for the big six, Bournemouth disagreed. So did the likes of Huddersfield, Brighton, Watford and the rest of the league’s smaller clubs. Which is why the executives around the table were slurping their pasta slightly more sombrely than the chef intended.John Henry, seated to the right of Joel Glazer, had come down from Boston to talk things through. Woodward and Gazidis, sitting opposite them, had been called to New York to add their input. But the group around the table knew that any hope of finding the 14 votes they would need to rip up the existing revenue-sharing agreement and draft a new one was all but doomed.Beyond that, the smaller clubs were united in opposition – and their resistance appeared to be a little stiffer than what the big six were used to steamrolling every Saturday afternoon. Within minutes of the topic being broached at the meeting earlier that month, it became obvious to the big six that they didn’t have a path to the 14-vote threshold. At least half of the league’s 20 clubs were not going to budge. The consensus was so strong that Scudamore didn’t even bother asking the clubs to go through the motions of a vote. There was no point. Instead, they had agreed to revisit the issue and try again three weeks later.But now, with seven days to go, the diners at Locanda Verde had to admit there had been no meaningful change. After years of attending Premier League meetings, Woodward and Gazidis had everyone’s voting tendencies memorised as if they were political pollsters. But when Woodward and Gazidis tallied up the two camps, even if every swing vote broke their way, they couldn’t make it work. The league was still gridlocked.Which left Henry, the Glazers and the rest of the big six owners backed into a corner. The Premier League’s revenue-sharing model, the two-thirds majority required for rule changes – these had been core tenets of the league ever since Rick Parry wrote them down on a sheet of Ernst \u0026amp Young notepaper 25 years before. They were the same tenets that had allowed English football to reach its position as the world’s pre-eminent league. But now, in downtown Manhattan, those pillars began to look as if they would have to come down. If the league’s top clubs couldn’t secure a more reasonable revenue split through peaceful means, what option did they have left? Nobody at the table uttered the words “European Super League”, but then, they didn’t need to.‘They threaten it all the time: ‘We’re going to break away,’” said one Premier League owner. “Sometimes they vaguely hint at it, sometimes they outwardly threaten it. But every time they want more money, it’s ‘Well, we’ll just go and play the big European teams.’” The spectre of a breakaway by the big six had been invoked so often during the previous decade that the Premier League now operated in a constant state of high alert, leaving even the most sober observers on edge. Which is how the Times ended up publishing a juicy front-page exclusive in March 2013 outlining secret plans for a Qatar-based “Dream Football League”, a new tournament to be played every two years and featuring 24 of Europe’s elite clubs, including Manchester United and a handful of other top Premier League teams. The DFL had the potential to “change the face of world football”, the Times story noted. Doubtless that would have been true but for one minor detail: the whole thing was a hoax dreamed up by a blogger on a satirical French website.The episode was embarrassing for Britain’s paper of record, but it got one thing right: the desire from forces inside the game to blow up the existing structures and reorganise around the most powerful clubs. In 2018, Fifa president Gianni Infantino was motivated to cook up a proposal for an expanded Club World Cup by an international consortium dangling more than $20bn. At the same time, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli was trying to convince his fellow superclubs to back a larger Champions League that would play on the weekends and shunt domestic league play into midweek.The big six were not shy about expressing their interest. So Scudamore responded the only way he could. Two weeks after the end of the season, he gathered the clubs again at the league’s annual general meeting in Yorkshire. Scudamore had begun to think of the year-long international rights debate as a boil that needed lancing. This time, nothing was off the table.The solution they agreed on distributed roughly one-third of all future international rights fees according to each club’s finishing position, meaning that the big six were almost certainly guaranteed a raise. To assuage the other 14 teams, they agreed that the ratio between the highest earner and the lowest earner’s payments would never exceed 1.8 to 1, a minor increase on the previous ratio of 1.6 to 1. The smaller clubs could tell themselves that the Premier League was still far more equitable than La Liga or Serie A. But as far as thebig six were concerned, they were finally on their way to righting a great injustice. In the interests of peace, the 20 clubs voted for it 18-2, and left Harrogate feeling relieved. But few gave much thought to the precedent they had just set. For the first time in 26 years, they had ratified a change to the Founder Members Agreement, the document that had governed the Premier League since its creation and provided the framework for its remarkable growth. It was as if they had taken a chisel to the Ten Commandments.Scudamore didn’t think the league would need to revisit the issue any time soon, but he wasn’t about to stick around to find out. Within hours of the Premier League’s announcement about the new revenue-sharing model, it followed up with a notice that Scudamore would step down by the end of the year.His battle to quell the big six was behind him. His UK television rights were sold – he had even brought Amazon into the fold by selling them the live streaming rights to a small package of games. And his international television rights were heading for another jackpot haul. It was time to punch out before the whole edifice started to wobble. “The stronger the Premier League is, the more successful the Premier League is, the more international rights go and generate, the more the TV deals go up, the less incentive there is for any of our clubs to go ‘Well, I’m going to leave the Premier League’,” Scudamore said. “The biggest antidote to chaos is a strong Premier League, for our clubs in England. And that’s the bottom line of it.”But he knew all too well that those outside forces would keep chipping away at the Premier League’s raison d’être, that those 20 businesses had less and less in common with one another, and that they might soon wonder why they were in business together at all. Whether those outside forces were investors from the Gulf trying to reshape the game, or even Fifa and Uefa redesigning the formats of club football hardly mattered. It was now clear that the most serious existential threat to the Premier League, itself formed by a breakaway in 1992, was, improbably, another breakaway.This is an edited extract from The Club: How the Premier League Became the Richest, Most Disruptive Business in Sport, by Jonathan Clegg \u0026amp Joshua Robinson, published by Hodder \u0026amp Stoughton and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd9810960271d29e40735fc46ee44362f212fe09/0_0_4280_2568/master/4280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1955d620087e2e135fe2bce0c8667e9","title":"how brexit unravelled today in focus podcast","story":"In a disastrous week for Theresa May’s Brexit agreement, her former director of strategy, Chris Wilkins, and the ’s Daniel Boffey chart where it all went wrong.

She is absolutely steeped in the party.”When Jacob Rees-Mogg invoked the Victorian prime minister Robert Peel last year to warn May against relying on Labour votes to pass her Brexit deal, he knew the analogy would hit home. Peel split his party over the corn laws, and banished them from power for a generation as a result.Wilkins says May is also sustained by a sense that she is the only grown-up in the room a serious politician executing what she repeatedly calls “the will of the people”, rather than posturing like the former public schoolboys she trounced in the Tory leadership race.“She has this phrase: ‘Politics is not a game.’ That is the Theresa May worldview,” he says.As the prime minister herself put it during her leadership speech: “I don’t tour the television studios. I don’t gossip about people over lunch. I don’t go drinking in parliament’s bars. I don’t often wear my heart on my sleeve. I just get on with the job in front of me.”Less charitable colleagues argue that this belief in her personal fitness to understand, and deliver, what the public wants is itself a kind of vanity.Aside from the august institution that is the Tory party, and the “precious union”, as she calls it, it can be hard to say what May believes in. Her former chief of staff Nick Timothy was an enthusiastic advocate of a kind of red Toryism.But the departure of “the chiefs” – Timothy and Fiona Hill – was one of the few things that did change after the general election, and that theme has been all but swamped by Brexit.However, one thread running consistently through May’s tenure as home secretary under David Cameron, and her premiership, has been controlling immigration.Unlike the former chancellor George Osborne, she was a champion of stricter migration controls. Vince Cable, who was the business secretary in the coalition, has even accused her of being obsessed with hitting the net migration target.As prime minister she has resisted removing students from the target despite a push from inside her own cabinet, and has put the brakes on visa liberalisation. She firmly believes the public’s view on immigration is more in line with her own than those of the more liberal Tory MPs.May’s “burning injustices” speech, delivered when she entered Downing Street in the tumultuous summer of 2016, has entered political folklore, not least because she frequently mentions it herself. But another speech, delivered the morning after the general election in 2017, with her grip on power uncertain, was a better guide to the tenor of May’s premiership.During the election campaign, the prime minister had made a personal plea to the public to back her Brexit strategy by increasing her majority so she could overrule remainers at Westminster.Far from endorsing her “strong and stable” leadership, the electorate appeared to warm to Jeremy Corbyn during what even her own colleagues acknowledge was a disastrous campaign, and stripped the Tories of their majority.That morning, speaking outside No 10, May gave not a hint of apology or humility, let alone suggest she would flex her position on Brexit to accommodate the dramatically different parliamentary reality.Instead, she said she had spoken to the Queen, and would work with the Democratic Unionist party to form “a government that can provide certainty and lead Britain forward at this critical time for our country”.She then gave a familiar promise to “deliver on the will of the British people by taking this country out of the European Union”, before briskly concluding: “Now let’s get to work.”It was as though “nothing has changed” – which began as her tetchy response to questions about the Tories’ social care policy at a campaign press conference – had become a guiding principle.These past months have brought together the stubborn grit that is May’s most visible character trait, with that overriding determination not to be the leader who splits the Tories – along with a firm belief that the public wants politicians to “deliver Brexit” and control immigration – and she’s the woman to do it.So perhaps it should be no surprise that May’s reaction to the resounding rejection of her Brexit deal by MPs from every party was, just like after her general election humiliation, “Now let’s get to work”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d61a769f4c4101f03fb773387650332518e0114/437_55_1493_896/master/1493.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb8df4e284bb08e314d8c8c595d8aad5","title":"off the incompetence scale readers react to mays brexit defeat","story":"You have been reacting to the prime minister’s historic defeat and debating what might be next for BrexitMay has to go.

May says she’s going to talk to parliamentarians about what to do next, but didn’t reach out to any of the opposition bar the DUP?She still doesn’t get it. This is not a Tory issue, its a national calamity. Grow up. TintenfischeI’m incredulous at political developments this morning. May loses by the biggest margin ever – yet wants to carry on as if nothing has changed, and Andrea Leadsom hectors the opposition for not supporting May. Over a hundred Tories vote against May in their vote of confidence and in the vote last night – but will all support her in a vote brought by someone else.May says she wants to reach out to others – but just not anyone who has a differing view. I don’t care which side of the argument you are on. This is contemptuous arrogance. How can it be defeated? dougmeyberryI think we all know that a general election at the moment, with both main parties still aiming for a cakeist Brexit, would solve nothing. A cross party agreement requires that the Tories talk to someone other than the DUP – or that large numbers of moderates on both sides defy the whips. How likely is that? A referendum will only work if the question is definitive, and even then is fraught with difficulty – there isn’t even a deal to vote on, is there? nufubarMay’s deal is fully and finally dead. There’s no more negotiation with the EU. Within a week, we’ll also find out that there will be no general election and no superior Labour Brexit. Norway+ means we keep freedom of movement, which effectively means we bin Brexit. If we’re going to pay the political price for that, we may as well go the whole way and just revoke article 50 and Remain.So there’s only two viable options left: either we jump off the no deal cliff and commit national suicide, which no one voted for, or we put this matter back to the people. Anyone who disagrees with a new referendum now needs to explain why they don’t want to resolve this impasse democratically, and what else they suggest. UltraLightBeamBoris Johnson and others will all claim that there’s a better deal to be renegotiated, but the EU have made it clear time after time that they won’t support anything materially different. So now the reality is no Brexit or hard Brexit. No political party would dare pick either of these, so eventually there must be a re-referendum. UnevenSurfaceI was a fool, because when May was announced prime minister I was relieved. But she’s the worst we’ve ever had, and she’s too damn proud and egotistical to do the decent thing and step away from a job she’s not up to.Her deal, I will give her this, actually united the country. Nobody thought it was a good idea. Remainers hate it, because why wouldn’t they? It’s essentially a half way house that ties us to the EU but without the influence we have now. So what’s the point? Leavers, well of course they hate it, because it’s not leaving properly, so what’s the point?After all I’ve said about May, she’d still beat Corbyn, because people don’t trust him, so he needs to do the decent thing and step down as well. These are not the best Britain can do, they are merely the political opportunists who have found themselves at the top, and its patently obvious that we need better political representation. SummersgoneI was a little surprised and mildly disturbed by the pictures posted from the voting lobbies. It looked like the MPs were having a great time voting against the PM’s motion. The fact that our country is standing at the abyss with an uncertain future seems to me anything other than a joyful occasion.I would have expected a sense of urgency at the very least. Once again proof that we’re being governed by a bunch of jokers who treat this whole Brexit dilemma as a game. Time for the people to take back control and demand that people’s vote. It may not be in our veins to fill streets and squares in protest, but if ever there was a time and moment, this surely must be it. CozitMakesSenseWhat if there’s another referendum, and leave wins again? Chaotic – revolution rousing, possibly – as it plainly would be, isn’t there an argument for the Government now to say “Sorry,we have tried to honour the referendum result, and we can’t do it. We have to revoke the activation of Article 50.”Of course, it could lead to horrendous, maybe ungovernable consequences. Choosing the least bad option seems seems very difficult, and there doesn’t seem to be anyone in parliament who can give clear, non-partisan leadership on it. But that’s the responsibility they have signed up for. Time for them to show their worth (if any of them have any). oxymoronFor the sake of our future generation, let’s ask them. I see no other solution than another vote with remain as an option. All this time and money wasted could have gone into schools and hospitals. Safeguard our universities. Protect our environment.

The  skips the main events of the night to focus on the issue of a no-deal, working its business contacts to give readers the headline: “Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal Brexit”.The Sun focuses on May’s invitation to Corbyn to discuss next steps, with the headline: “Come on over to May place”. it raises the question, if May were replaced with a prime minister whose name lent itself less well to puns, would the Sun explode? The paper blames Corbyn for the current impasse, saying: “Theresa May dramatically invited Jeremy Corbyn to Downing Street last night for emergency Brexit talks” but “the EU exit deadlock crisis deepened when the hard left Labour boss ducked the invitation”.The Mirror gives top billing to Corbyn’s response to May’s offer: “Ditch No Deal .. and then we’ll talk Brexit”. The Mirror paints a picture of the Labour leader in control, saying “Jeremy Corbyn last night snubbed Theresa May’s plea to help save her Brexit” after “the PM begged rival party leaders to join her for talks”.The Daily Mail paints things quite differently, saying “May wins confidence vote, invites Labour leader for Brexit talks at No 10, then .. wrecker Corbyn slams door on Theresa”. It accuses him of “playing party politics” after rejecting talks to break the deadlock.The Times also lays the blame for the lack of progress at the Labour leader’s feet with “Corbyn snubs Brexit talks”. Rather than saying the PM had “begged” the Labour leader to join in talks, as the Mirror does, the Times says “She appealed to opposition MPs to work with her on a revised deal ... The Labour leader resisted the overture, however, insisting that Mrs May abandon a no-deal exit before the start of any ‘positive talks’.”The i scoops up a variety of potential outcomes from this week’s failed Brexit vote, including a “Softer Brexit”, which is its headline, as well as cabinet resignations, a split Conservative party, and a new Scottish independence referendum.

She began legal proceedings after claiming she was dropped from the British Cycling squad for the 2016 Rio Olympics in retaliation for criticising her coaches. She argued that she was in effect an employee of both British Cycling and UK Sport and therefore should be subject to certain protections under law – including sick pay, a pension and the right to sue for unfair dismissal.However, at a tribunal in Manchester last month British Cycling and UK Sport claimed national lottery funding for athletes is more akin to a university grant and therefore should not be subject to the same employment rights.After several weeks of deliberation their position was supported by Judge Ross, who on Wednesday ruled that Varnish was neither an employee nor a worker of either organisation. It means the cyclist will not be able to pursue a claim for unfair dismissal, sex discrimination and detriment suffered for being a whistleblower against British Cycling or UK Sport.Varnish, a former European team sprint champion and world silver medallist, is due to have a baby on Thursday and has not commented on the decision.Her agent said that she and her legal team would “digest the 43-page judgment” and look to offer a statement on Thursday. A British Cycling spokesman welcomed the verdict but made it clear the organisation regretted that Varnish’s case had ever gone to a tribunal.“The decision to contest this case was founded on what we believe is the best interests of riders who represent Great Britain, and our conviction that our relationship with them is not one of employer-employee but that of a service provider supporting talented and dedicated athletes to achieve their best,” he said.“We very much regret that Jess was advised to pursue the route of an employment tribunal when we had made significant efforts to reach a resolution which all parties regarded as equitable.”The spokesman also insisted that the macho culture in British Cycling that Varnish had spoken out about had improved. “Thanks to a lot of hard work by staff and riders the culture of the Great Britain cycling team is changed for the better since Jess first raised her concerns and we hope to welcome her to the national cycling centre as we would any other rider who has represented Great Britain,” he added.Varnish had claimed in April 2016 that the then British Cycling technical director, Shane Sutton, had told her “to go and have a baby” when she was dropped from funding before the Rio Games. A subsequent UK Sport independent investigation into bullying claims at British Cycling cleared Sutton, who had previously resigned, of that remark but found him to have used sexist language against Varnish.Meanwhile the ruling was greeted with relief by UK Sport, which faced having to overturn the way it funds British athletes if it had lost.Currently around 1,100 elite athletes are funded by UK Sport up to a maximum of £28,000 a year, tax-free. If Varnish had been successful the athletes would have benefited from employment rights and pension. However, UK Sport insisted that as a consequence it would have been unable to fund as many potential Olympians to achieve their dreams.It did acknowledge, however, that it had taken on board some of the issues that Varnish’s case had raised, particularly the need to provide a greater duty of care for athletes. “Whilst this verdict did not find Jessica Varnish to be an employee or worker of UK Sport or British Cycling, we have already taken action to strengthen the duty of care and welfare provided to athletes and are ensuring that avenues for raising any concerns are effective and appropriate,” it added.“It also gives us confidence that the structure of the relationship between other national governing bodies, their athletes and UK Sport can continue in a similar way but we will reflect on the concerns that were raised through this case when finalising our future strategy for post Tokyo.“We regret for Jessica Varnish, her partner and her family that pursuing this case was considered the best course of action she had to address the concerns she felt she experienced as an athlete on the British Cycling world class programme. We hope Jess feels proud of the success she achieved through cycling and we wish her all the very best for the future.”Joe Morrow, the lawyer who advised UK Sport, said: “This case marks a crucial moment for athletes and the entire sports industry safeguarding funding for athletes for the future. If the tribunal had ruled in favour of the claimant, funding for more than 1,000 could have been called into question.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42d3c46112894300981a34b03908751c1144a6cf/8_122_5246_3149/master/5246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0138c3b22f087840ba900f78cb1884c","title":"manu tuilagi explosive england six nations comeback george ford","story":"• Injury-plagued Tuilagi last started a Six Nations match in 2013• ‘I have never seen anyone as explosive as Manu’England’s Six Nations rivals have been warned to brace themselves for a resurgent Manu Tuilagi when the tournament kicks off in just over a fortnight. The injury-plagued centre has not started a Six Nations game since 2013 but his teammate George Ford believes the Leicester man is primed to make a significant impact this season.Tuilagi will be among a 35-strong England squad announced at Twickenham on Thursday for a pre-tournament camp in Portugal in the run-up to their opening match against last year’s grand slam winners, Ireland, in Dublin. The head coach, Eddie Jones, still has plenty of possible midfield options but a fit and firing Tuilagi would add a fresh attacking dimension.Ford, for one, senses Tuilagi is poised to come back with a bang. “I have never seen anyone as explosive as Manu,” said Ford, vying with Owen Farrell for the starting No 10 jersey against the Irish. “He is aggressive with it too. Manu wants to do some damage on the field … the opposition fear playing against him and he is unplayable at times. He offers a different dimension, definitely. You could put him in any team and he would make an impact.”The challenge for England is to unleash him in the right areas to maximise his strengths. “We all know how good Manu can be but you do need to be detailed in the way you attack. With Manu, we need to give him one-on-ones and soft shoulders. We’ve got to work hard on the inside to give him that bit of space on the outside where you can see his full potential.“I’m not saying he can’t smash into people or get you quick release ball from that breakdown but, if you want to see Manu at his best in terms of line-breaks, running through people and scoring tries, then the attack has to be smart by fixing guys so he can do what he does best. He is unbelievably powerful and so hard to stop. At the end of the day, he wants the ball in his hands in a bit of space. And if there isn’t any space, he wants to run over the top of someone.”It is also Ford’s belief Tuilagi has finally put behind him the injury woes that have savagely curtailed his career since 2013. “Manu looks as good as I’ve seen for a while,” said Ford. “He is out there every day, doing full sessions and looking as if he is moving a lot better. With Manu the crucial thing is just for him to keep playing because he will definitely get back to the player he was. Even when he does not get the ball the number of defenders he attracts is so important to a side.“In our last Premiership match against Gloucester he was particularly impressive in defence, flying around, putting big hits in. His match fitness is getting back there, which is really exciting for the club and for England as well.”The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.It is now almost eight years since a trademark Tuilagi score helped England beat Ireland 20-9 in a 2011 World Cup warm-up in Dublin. It would be a surprise if Jones does not include him in his starting XV at the Aviva Stadium a fortnight on Saturday, either alongside Ben Te’o, Henry Slade or Farrell should Ford be picked at 10. The latter suggests that, in an ideal world, Tuilagi would prefer to wear 13. “I know he likes 13 at the club with Kyle Eastmond or Matt Toomua inside him. He feels it gives him a little bit extra space.”With England’s injury problems having eased slightly since the autumn, Jones will also be looking forward to seeing Billy Vunipola back in an England jersey but it seems unlikely that recently sidelined players, including Chris Robshaw, will feature against Ireland. Jones also needs to find a replacement for the injured Sam Underhill and decide where the long-serving Dan Cole fits in to his 2019 World Cup plans.George Ford is a Land Rover ambassador.

His ambition to topple Linford Christie’s 25-year-old British 100m record. His intention to break 20 seconds in the 200m. And – for good measure – to finish off the year by taking gold at the world championships in Doha.Some will scoff. But why should Prescod not shoot for the stars in the post-Usain Bolt era, when the title of the world’s best sprinter is up for grabs for the first time in over a decade? Especially when he is only 22 and he already finishes like a bullet train?In August, after Prescod won a European silver medal in Berlin and set a new 100m personal best of 9.94sec a week later, he bought himself a projector to help analyse his races. But he does not need a giant screen to know he is heading for the big time if he can master getting out of the blocks.“I am confident I am one of the best finishers in the world,” he says. “I have been working on a few things over winter and it feels like my start is getting better every time I go out. I got it down by a tenth in 2018 and it is getting faster. But I am in a generation now where the top guys, such as Ronnie Baker and Christian Coleman, are phenomenal. No one has ever started so fast as them. So, if I can get it down a little more, I will be in contention.”Prescod will get the chance to show how much he has kicked on when he competes over 60m at the Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix next month against the world indoor silver medallist, Su Bingtian, CJ Ujah and Richard Kilty. “It is a perfect opportunity to work on my start and make sure I don’t give myself too much to do in races,“ he says, although he is yet to decide whether to go for the European Indoor Championships in Glasgow in March.Instead his main focus is on making the grandest of splashes when it comes to the outdoor season. “After the indoors I will take a bit of a break because I have had a hard winter and then I will pick it up again around May,” he says. “With the worlds in September and October I need to be smart and not over-push myself.“And while I can’t give you all the secrets, I have already planned what I’d like to achieve,” he adds. “The priority is the world championships – I finished seventh in the final last time so I want to at least get a medal or win that. When it comes to the nationals I’ve also won two years in a row so it would be good to get a hat-trick. Meanwhile in the 100m the British record is the first aim, and in the 200m I want sub-20. And in an ideal world I want to run sub-10 at every meet. They are my five base targets.”These are lofty goals. But Prescod clearly has great expectations. “Year by year it will come,” he says. “If I look at Usain Bolt’s career he was getting bigger and stronger each year. But I don’t want to rest on my laurels and be comfortable. I want to put myself out there and be a competitor.”Tickets to see the world’s best athletes on Saturday 16 February at the Müller Indoor Grand Prix, Birmingham, are on sale now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14becf40405a30d6bc70c362528d50475033349d/0_663_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e54f1a7690c2bdcec911fc497918d50","title":"government shutdown stories federal workers life without pay","story":"Hundreds of workers contacted the  to describe the impact on their lives, including anxiety over family finances and worries for the future. Here are some of their storiesI am a seasonal Forest Service employee and making plans for next season and beyond. As long as the shutdown continues, I will not hear back from government jobs and I continue to question my faith in the federal government being a stable career option.The president runs the country like a mob boss and currently is holding part of the federal government on ransom. I have little hope he’ll do what’s right. This sets a precedent for Democrats shutting down government to fulfill any campaign promise as well. You may agree on this issue, but will you always? Brendan, forestry technician, Davenport, IowaI am a federal law enforcement officer. I have been forced to work without pay. I have now been sent to the United States-Mexico border for 21 days on a program called “Border Surge”. Every 21 days a group of federal law enforcement officers are being taken away from their families and normal duty stations and sent to the border to supplement border patrol operations. This is costing the American taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars a month and requiring officers to be away from their families for extended periods of time with more financial burden due to the fact they’re in travel status.I’m not a border patrol agent and I’m working as if I am. I am most likely going to have to request a furlough to get a second job in order to pay my bills. I pay rent to the government in the house they require me to live in. This is a terrible situation that’s putting a great deal of stress on myself and family. I feel like I’m being held hostage by my employer requiring me to work without pay. Anon, federal law enforcement officer, FloridaI am two weeks away from closing on my first home, something I have been saving for years to do. Now without a paycheck during the biggest purchase of my life, my finances are dire. I live on the border and see firsthand that a wall is not what we need, it is a huge waste of money and such a foolish idea. I do not support the wall but I need my job back. Anon, biologist, ArizonaOur national historical park has been closed since 21 December and this has resulted in a closed museum, closed cultural center, closed visitor center, cancelled school field trips and educational programs, cancelled events by community organizations that were to be held at the park.About 80 park staff were furloughed (without pay). Our role as steward of irreplaceable cultural and natural heritage is in abeyance – with all that entails regarding potential damage, deprived use and delayed preservation and community engagement. Anon, National Park Service supervisory ranger, Lowell, MassachusettsMy wife works at the IRS and has been furloughed due to the most recent shutdown. This means she is not working and will not receive her mid-month paycheck on 11 January, something we depend on. I am a teacher for students with disabilities and do not make a lot of money. We have three children of our own to support at home and this sudden removal of half our combined income has caused a great deal of unneeded stress on our lives.My wife has filed for unemployment and taken out a loan from her 401(k). We’ve taken my son out of daycare to save money and we will need to use all of our savings if that check doesn’t come. I tried to become a Lyft driver but my car will not pass inspection due to a busted tailgate panel that will cost $800 to fix. If we don’t get paid by February, I will need to sell my car. Tyler, teacher, Austin, TexasI work at the Nasa Kennedy Space Center and was furloughed a couple weeks ago. My last paycheck is running out and I only have a few hundred in savings, so I took out a loan at the credit union to cover bills. While I take responsibility for not having more in savings, which would have greatly reduced my stress, I seriously resent that my paycheck is a pawn in this political game.My fear is that if this goes on too long, I will start missing mortgage payments and risk losing my house that I just bought a year ago. I was homeless once and don’t ever want to go back to that. Rachel Cox, mechanical engineer, FloridaI’m considered an essential IRS employee – I work in Remittance, where tax payments are received – so although I’ve not been furloughed, I saw my last paycheck before the Christmas holiday, while I continue to report for work each day.I was down to $175 in all of my accounts because of past bills just now going through. I’m not the only farmer affected! The USDAFSA does not need to be shut down over his darn wall. I fear now that I’ll lose everything. Anon, rancherfarmer, NebraskaI am in the same boat as my 800,000 government brethren. I am a single mom with two kids, I am not getting paid, I am still expected to show up for work. I have bills and a mortgage and am expected to continue to pay them. How? I am also expected to feed my family and pets. Without money, how am I to do that? How will I get to work if my car is impounded? Where will I live when my house is foreclosed? Does anyone out there care that 800,000 people are held hostage by the US government?Morale is at an all-time low at work. Everyone walks around with worried faces. How can Congress (both parties) sleep at night? Oh, that’s right, they received a $10,000 raise and continue to get paid on schedule!

It is picking and choosing who gets opportunity and who doesn’t based on what you look like, based on your faith, based on how long you’ve been in this country.”Castro’s two-day jaunt to New Hampshire featured no rallies and just one public event: A meet and greet at a coffee shop on Tuesday night. On Wednesday in Manchester, he told business leaders of his visions for a fairer and more prosperous America in the 21st century.He then travelled nearly 50 miles north to the small city of Laconia, the seat of a county where Donald Trump saw his most dominant victory in the state in 2016, to tour its downtown and visit an addiction treatment centre. In Laconia, Castro seemed most interested in learning about the challenges local business face and the ways the opioid crisis has ravaged this former mill town and other areas of New England.Perhaps Castro’s unconventional style of early campaigning – marked by his Puerto Rico visit and the lack of rallies in New Hampshire – can help raise his profile as he enters a crowded Democratic primary field filled with political superstars.Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren announced her exploratory committee on New Year’s Eve Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard announced that she would seek the presidency last week New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand threw her hat in the ring on Tuesday. Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, former vice-president Joe Biden, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders and and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke are all tipped as contenders.In New Hampshire, Castro got his first “official” taste of the campaign trail. “Here in New Hampshire, ya’ll take your politics as seriously as we take our barbecue in Texas,” he told the audience in Manchester, remarking on the state’s once every four years political fervour.For many in New Hampshire, the visit was the first introduction to Castro.As the candidate walked down a snow-piled Main Street in Laconia and dropped into local businesses, many did not seem to recognize him and instead appeared taken aback by the flock of cameras following him.Laconia resident and business owner Carlos Cardona, who was helping guide Castro through the city, told him not to worry when Obama first visited downtown Laconia in 2007, nobody knew who he was either.In Manchester, Castro sought to introduce voters to his political platforms. Among them: using his first executive order to recommit the US to the Paris Agreement, universal healthcare, universal pre-kindergarten, tuition-free colleges, reforming the criminal justice system, raising the minimum wage and finding affordable housing solutions.“It takes vision. My vision is that in the 21st century, America will be the smartest, healthiest, fairest and most prosperous nation on earth,” he told the crowd.Speaking to the , Castro laid out a foreign policy platform that involved repairing damaged alliances and moving away from the “erratic” decision-making of the Trump administration.“The number one thing I am going to do as president, at the beginning of my administration if I’m elected, is to repair the damaged relationships that this administration has caused around the world,” he said.Washington should forge new alliances, Castro said, particularly in Latin America. If citizens of those nations can feel safe in their home countries, he argued, it could help stem the flow of migrants arriving at the US’s southern border.On Syria, Castro said he supported withdrawing US troops, but in a “sensible way”.“What’s been missing from the president’s foreign policy has been a consistent and well thought out approach,” he said. “He has been very erratic. And that’s what needs to change in the next administration.”While Cardona, one of Castro’s guides through Laconia, said he hopes to welcome more Democratic candidates to the city and remains undecided, he appeared enthusiastic about Castro.“As a Latino myself, I think it’s important that we have a Latino standing up during this administration,” he said, adding that he considered Castro a “top tier” candidate.And if he does take the nomination, Castro believes he can beat Trump.“I believe that the Democratic nominee in 2020, whoever he or she is, will be able to win that election. Because I think more and more people are seeing that we’re falling short with this president, that America can do much better,” he said. “So I’m confident that if I’m the nominee, I can win in 2020.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d3c4eda36c5ef0fc1ea0d232bb6aaabc6d12b4/0_0_3527_2115/master/3527.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=251b8b08dc156df923de0afe10a24ddd","title":"us russia inf treaty nuclear missile","story":"The US has rejected Moscow’s offer to inspect a new Russian missile suspected of violating a key cold-war era nuclear-weapons treaty, and warned that it would suspend observance of the agreement on 2 February, giving six-month notice of a complete withdrawal.The under-secretary of state for arms control and international security, Andrea Thompson, confirmed the US intention to withdraw from the treaty after a meeting with a Russian delegation in Geneva, which both sides described as a failure.Donald Trump took US allies by surprise when he announced his intention to leave the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty in October. The agreement led to the destruction of thousands of US and Soviet weapons, and has kept nuclear missiles out of Europe for three decades.The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, accused the US of intransigence, saying Moscow had offered to allow US experts inspect the suspect missile, which it insists does not infringe the limits laid down in the treaty.“However, US representatives arrived with a prepared position that was based on an ultimatum and centred on a demand for us to destroy this rocket, its launchers, and all related equipment under US supervision,” Lavrov said.Thompson noted that the US had been demanding Russian transparency over the missile for more than five years. She confirmed that the offer of inspections was not enough and that the US was demanding the destruction of the missile system, known as the 9M729.“We explained to our Russian counterparts specifically what they would need to do in order to return to compliance in a manner that we can confirm, verifiable destruction of the non-compliant system,” Thompson said.“To see the missile does not confirm that distance that missile can travel, and at the end of the day that’s the violation of the treaty,” Thompson said in a phone briefing for reporters. She said that there were currently no plans for a follow-up talks on the INF before the 2 February deadline laid down by the Trump administration, though US and Russian diplomats would be meeting, including at a summit of the Nato-Russian council next week.Thompson said that if Russia did not show willingness to comply with the treaty by the deadline, the US would suspend its own obligations, meaning that the US defense department could start research and development on missiles with ranges currently banned by the INF, from 500 to 5,500km.At the same time, she told reporters, the US would formally give notice of its withdrawal from the treaty, which could come into effect on 2 August.After that, there would be no restrictions on deployment of medium-range missiles in Europe or the Pacific.The Obama administration had complained to Russia about its new missile but had not threatened to leave the treaty. Diplomats said that Trump’s third national security adviser, John Bolton, persuaded him to withdraw, despite opposition from the state and defence departments, and from European allies.After a reported appeal from Germany’s Angela Merkel, the administration agreed to a two-month delay, to give a last chance for diplomacy to save the INF.Thompson confirmed that the Russian delegation in Geneva had raised their concerns about US missile defence launchers which Moscow says can be adapted to fire offensive missiles. She said that the US officials had repeated US insistence that the launchers were compliant with the INF, and provided documentary evidence.The Trump administration was criticised by former officials and arms control advocates for not pursuing the Russian offer of inspections.“We’ve spent years trying to get something – anything – out of the Russians on INF. The Russian offer of an exhibition of the 9M729 is not enough, but it is something,” Alexandra Bell, a former senior state department official who is now senior policy director at the Centre for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.“Perhaps it is a foundation on which to build. Not trying to take advantage of this opportunity is to leave diplomatic options on the table and that’s just foolish.”Daryl Kimball, the head of the Arms Control Association said: “If the INF is terminated on 2 August, there will be nothing to prevent Russia from deploying nuclear missiles that threaten Europe and the Trump administration will have no hesitation in pursuing the deployment of INF-prohibited weapons in Europe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db4f8a252f3a43664c6fe8dcc29e5a97ffc8ebfa/0_461_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c287bdcad22f8723b55b36d171f41dba","title":"thailand refugee policy shift rahaf saudi arabia","story":"Immigration chief says country ‘will now follow international norms’ yet is still considering extraditing refugee Hakeem al-Araibi Thailand’s immigration chief has pledged a reversal of the country’s notoriously harsh treatment of refugees following the global furore around a young Saudi woman’s attempt to seek asylum.Speaking on Wednesday, the newly appointed head of immigration, Surachate Hakparn, said refugees would no longer be returned home “involuntarily”. This would be a major shift in the long-running policy in Thailand of refusing to recognise and shelter asylum seekers and frequently returning them to countries where they are in danger. Thailand is also not a signatory to the UN convention on refugees.Surachate pledged that going forward, when it comes to asylum seekers, Thailand “will now follow international norms”.Thailand’s draconian immigration policies have been under the global spotlight over the past week, following the case of 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed from Saudi Arabia, who fled her abusive family and attempted to seek asylum in Australia. She captured headlines across the world after she was intercepted during a stopover in Bangkok and immediately prepared for deportation back to Saudi Arabia by Thai immigration authorities.It was only after Mohammed barricaded herself in a Bangkok hotel room and began tweeting her plight to the world, drawing international publicity and support, that Thailand made the rare exception to release her into the care of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and be given asylum in Canada, arriving in Toronto on Sunday.Surachate was adamant however that the Thai authorities had not caved to “pressure” in Mohammed’s case.However, inconsistencies in Surachate’s pledges to reform the Thai immigration process were already exposed in his comments on the ongoing case of Hakeem al-Araibi.Al-Araibi, a Bahraini refugee with permanent residency in Australia, was taken into detention when he arrived in Bangkok for a holiday in November, and faces deportation back to Bahrain where he says he will be at risk of torture.Al-Araibi, a former footballer for the Bahrain national team who now plays semi-professional football in Melbourne, was picked up by Thai immigration on an Interpol red notice, , despite having refugee status in Australia since 2017. Australia has made repeated calls for him to be released and returned home to Australia.Surachate said the case was “different” because there was an “outstanding warrant” for him, despite the fact that the Interpol red notice, requested by Bahrain and erroneously issued against Interpol’s own refugee-protection protocols, has since been lifted.Thailand is instead processing a formal extradition request from Bahrain, and Surachate would only say that al-Araibi would be able to make his case “in court”.Surachate’s appointment as department chief has been marked by a harsh crackdown on illegal immigrants over the past three months, which has resulted in women and children refugees, who had previously been released, rounded up again and put back into detention – described as “government shelters” – despite an earlier promise by the government to no longer detain single mothers and children.However, speaking on Wednesday, Surachate pledged that all women and children in immigration detention would be given bail ‘“tomorrow”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ebf17e42739ad052a11ee29df7690078215a027/0_270_2806_1685/master/2806.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=526d8fc057d83e6856eb67892b52ceb8","title":"thursday briefing take no deal brexit off table corbyn demands","story":"Theresa May calls for MPs to put ‘self-interest’ aside … scientists devise diet to save the planet … and how a citizens’ assembly might workGood morning, I’m Warren Murray and it’s the “ideas on a postcard please” stage of Brexit.Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not accept an offer to hold talks with Theresa May until she agrees to remove the threat of a no-deal Brexit.

Larry Elliott, our economics editor, points out this morning that “the pound rose and all was calm on the stock market” after the events of Tuesday: “As far as the financial markets were concerned, the message was clear: the voting down by MPs of Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement means a delayed Brexit, a softer Brexit or perhaps no Brexit at all.” But he argues that while a “Brexit in name only” might mean less short-term pain, it would represent a squandered chance to fix a broken economic system.Future eaters – A science-based diet to tackle poor nutrition globally and steer our food habits away from damaging the environment has been devised. The “planetary health diet” calls for red meat and sugar consumption to be cut by half, while vegetables, fruit, pulses and nuts must double. Across the world 800 million people are hungry, 2 billion malnourished and 2 billion overweight or obese. International experts came up with the diet of 2,500 calories a day. It includes a beef burger and two servings of fish a week. Most protein comes from pulses and nuts milk, cheese, butter and eggs are allowed in moderation while half of each plate of food is vegetables and fruit and a third is wholegrain cereals. Meanwhile some food for thought from Tony Naylor: should meat-free dishes also be cheap? A pub company has been criticised over its £14 cauliflower “steak” – but one top chef explains: “It’s a lot cheaper to buy in pre-cut meats than vegetables you have to transform into something interesting. Anything that takes a long prep time, the price will reflect that.”Mental health risk of broken families – Parental break-ups are more likely to trigger anxiety and depression in children if they are aged at least seven, but appear to have no effect if they are younger, research suggests. “One possible reason for this is that children are more sensitive to relationship dynamics at this age,” said Professor Emla Fitzsimons, study co-author from University College London. The first British study of its kind looked at 6,245 children and young people. The researchers found those from poorer and wealthier backgrounds were equally likely to experience mental ill-health. Tom Madders from the charity YoungMinds said it was important to build children’s resilience from a young age and “teach them to learn about healthy relationships, both with others and themselves”.Trumped up – Fake editions of the Washington Post with a large headline announcing Donald Trump’s departure from the White House have been passed around in the US capital by a group of activists.“Trickster activist collective” the Yes Men revealed they were behind the prank.

Men and women crammed into the nooks and crannies between the books listen intently as Wipaphan Wongsawang picks up a microphone and gestures around her. “Women in Thailand should not have to be silent about rape and assault any longer,” she says. “It’s time people started talking about consent.”Wongsawang is the founder of Thaiconsent, a project that began as a series of articles explaining the concept of sexual consent to her friends. In the past 12 months it has grown into an online platform containing hundreds of stories of rape and assault, and inspired an exhibition of artworks designed to challenge Thailand’s culture of misunderstanding over sexual assault.“Before, in Thailand we never spoke about this concept of ‘consent’ in sex,” Wongsawang tells the . “And when it comes to news about assault, or rape, particularly rape by someone you know, the first questions that anyone asks the woman are: ‘How did you let this happen?’, ‘What were you wearing? or ‘Were you drinking?’ The first instinct is always to blame the women. And there’s a damaging assumption here by men in Thailand that if women don’t say anything, that means yes.”Activists agree that it is premature to call this Thailand’s #MeToo moment – there has been no naming and shaming of public figures, and the subject is only slowly filtering into public discourse. But the Thaiconsent project and recent hashtag #donttellmehowtodress, which went viral in Thailand this year, have revealed a desire to change the perceptions and handling of sexual assault.One of the first to speak out was Thararat Panya, a law student at Thailand’s Thammasat University, who last year posted an uncompromising account of her sexual assault by a fellow student on social media. Then in April, Thai model Cindy Sirinya Bishop began the popular #donttellmehowtodress hashtag after hearing that Thai authorities told women to “not dress sexy” to avoid sexual assault.“Our culture is not one that is so confrontational, and it’s going to be a while until a woman comes out and names names or points a finger in the media,” says Bishop. “But over the last few months, I’ve seen women in Thailand begin to collectively speak out, sharing their stories and pushing back on this victim-blaming which previously has gone completely unchecked here.”Panya agrees. “Society here really misunderstands sexual assault – everyone told me to keep quiet – and the justice system works against the victim,” she says. “But this year I’ve started to see a real change in attitudes.”Wongsawang experienced an attempted rape when she was 20 by a friend while at university. “At that time I didn’t understand what had happened to me,” she says. “So for a year I kept quiet, with this eating away at my heart.”But over the course of a year, the same thing happened to eight of her friends, who were all raped, harassed or sexually assaulted by people they knew but had no idea how to handle it or who to go to. Those who did report it were rarely taken seriously. “I kept thinking: was this normal in our society?” says Wongsawang. “Especially as our attackers would go on as normal, as if nothing wrong had happened.”For Wongsawang, learning about sexual consent was “like a light went on”. She began writing articles and, after graduating, opened the Thaiconsent Facebook page in late 2017. She encouraged people to share stories, anonymously, of incidents where they had been forced into sex without their consent, be it through violence or emotional coercion. The response was overwhelming.“People had never been given a platform like this to tell these stories before and feel like they were valid and not judged.” Over the course of this year, more than 400 stories have flooded in. Most have been from women, but three have been from men. Most had never taken their accounts to the authorities. It proved so successful, she now intends to make Thaiconsent into a formal organisation.There is still a long way to go. Both Bishop and Wongsawang railed against the way rape and assault were normalised in Thai popular culture, particularly in TV soap operas. It is so pervasive that since she began started #donttellmehowtodress and organised the Social Power Exhibition Against Sexual Assault, which will continue to tour Thailand in 2019, Bishop has had to turn down several TV roles that she felt compromised her activism.“The biggest problem I see in Thailand is the dangerous gap in conversations about sex, where men don’t ask what women want, they just take it,” says Wongsawang. “And for women, often they don’t dare to express what they want or don’t want. Thai women are taught to say yes – we are groomed to please others – and not empowered to say, ‘No, I don’t want this,’ especially to someone she knows. It’s these attitudes we want to change.”Navaon Siradapuvadol contributed to the reporting on this story"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"The first significant career choice you make will not necessarily be life-determiningRegister your details now \u0026ndash you can determine your final course preferences laterMany students receive financial help but preparation is key when it comes to securing the correct level of fundingAvoid the traps: Parents can offer vital support, but their knowledge is often outdatedWhat factors should you consider when deciding on what career path you wish to takeMultinational firms concerned over standard of foreign languages among school-leaversWe talk to graduates who made the wrong call when they filled out the CAO formTimeline for the 2019 college application processThousands to apply for courses ahead of this month\u0026rsquos application deadlineDownload PDFs of our comprehensive list of level 8 and level 67 courses"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Geoffrey Shannon called for cybercrime and pornography agreements ratification in 2014Three minutes to explain a science concept to a jury and an audience \u0026ndash no slides allowedResearch Lives: Dr Deirdre Murray, Irish Centre for Fetal and Neonatal Translational Research and UCCGarda\u0026iacute say unlicensed middle men have erted \u0026euro23m away from insurance firmsSmart meters will help customers make better choices about their consumptionMotorists must apply a month before travelling under Irish insurance industry planIreland South MEP (54) likely to announce end of Brussels career on health groundsMinister for Transport\u0026rsquos Brexit remarks were \u0026lsquoas if he didn\u0026rsquot even read his own documents\u0026rsquoNew study also says the changes have widened gaps for disadvantaged pupilsTech giant has received removal requests from elected representatives and judiciaryGarda checkpoints are \u0026lsquoover the top\u0026rsquo and akin to \u0026lsquopolice state\u0026rsquo, Cabinet member claimsGerman woman knits two lines each day in colours symbolising length of train delaysBrendan Smith is the second senior Fianna F\u0026aacuteil figure to declare his candidacy in a dayLess-well-off counties will see shortfalls made up, but rates will not rise with house pricesLimerick woman calls for change to concurrent sentencing for repeat sex offendersPoliticians call for action to tackle alcohol abuseGovernment believes the ministerial visits are more important than ever\u0026lsquoThere is no doubt that there is a high level of political polarisation in Poland\u0026rsquoNurses criticised for strike action for maximum impact \u0026lsquoat the very time we are facing such a risk to our economy\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3760487.1547670725!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit block so many possible outcomes so little time","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUK prime minister Theresa May listens during a debate on a motion of no confidence. Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesTen weeks out from the date when Brexit is due to take place, the extraordinary thing is that the range of possible outcomes remains so wide. The massive defeat in the House of Commons of the proposed withdrawal agreement championed by UK prime minister Theresa May has plunged the whole process into fresh uncertainty. So how could it all work out?The first thing to note is that if nothing is agreed, then the UK will leave the EU on March 29th in what is called a no-deal Brexit, when all trading and regulatory rules change overnight. It is clear that a majority in the House of Commons does not want this to happen – and neither does the EU. But something has to change for it to avoided.So what might that be? Theresa May has said she will consult across the House of Commons and some senior parliamentarians are threatening to take matters into their own hands if she does not do so quickly. There could be a majority for a softer version of Brexit, with the Labour Party saying it wants to stay in the EU customs union – and many MPs favouring a relationship similar to Norway, which is in the European Economic Area and is a member of the single market. This would require the UK to drop some of the existing “red lines” it has held to.A change in approach could be signalled in the political declaration – the document accompanying the withdrawal agreement that signals where the two sides want to go in future talks. Some special measures might still be required to guarantee no hard border in Ireland, though less than currently envisaged in the controversial backstop plan. The backstop would stay in the withdrawal agreement, in case future trade talks did not work out.If parliament cannot agree on what kind of deal it wants, support could build for a second referendum. Some MPs on both sides already favour this route. How the ballot would be worded is open to question, but clearly a Remain win would lead the UK to revoke Article 50 and stay as an EU member.There is also building speculation that, given how late things are running, Article 50 might be extended, meaning the UK would leave at a later date. However, an extension of Article 50 – unlike a revocation – must be agreed by all the 27 other EU member states. They are likely to want the UK to point a way forward before agreeing to this.Finally, it is still possible that Theresa May will get the deal so roundly rejected this week through parliament, perhaps following some tweaks in the political declaration. However, given the scale of the defeat, this will be very difficult, with the hard Brexit lobby and the DUP demanding changes that Brussels will not sign up to.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Since 2010, the search giant has received 87 requests from State bodies and officials, including elected representatives, relating to the 249 web results. It also received 15 requests from the Irish judiciary to remove 85 links to content, usually on foot of a court order relating to a defamation case. The vast majority of the requests related to Google’s search service and YouTube, which it also owns. Google complied with 35.4 per cent of State requests. It was far more likely to comply with requests from courts than from the Government.According to Google, 68 of the 102 requests came from organisations or officials complaining about “privacy and security” while 23 alleged defamation. It categorised the remainder under hate speech, fraud, trademark or copyright infringement, adult content and suicide promotion. Other reasons for removal which can be cited include electoral law and “government criticism”. According to the data relating to Ireland, no requests have been made for the removal of links because of government criticism. Google provides little information about the authority the requests were made under or the exact reasons behind them. However, it gave three anonymised “samples” of Government requests for the removal of search results. One request came from a Government official seeking the removal of a link “to a State-run newspaper article that reported on the official being charged in a US court for battery”. Google refused the request. Another request came from an Irish politician who asked Google to remove links to “reputable news articles”, alleging they were defamatory. Google refused after determining the articles were not about the politician but about a convicted murderer who shared his name. A third request came from the Courts Service asking for the removal of weblinks from Google because they contained “inaccurate criticism of a judge’s exercise of authority”. The pages in question criticised a judge for their decision but under “the procedural rules of the Irish courts the judge had no legal discretion in the matter”, Google said. It agreed to remove the links. A Court Service spokesman said he did not know what the request related to and that it could have come from an inidual court office. He said he had not made a take-down request to Google in at least five years and “would be very slow to do so” unless, for example, someone was making threats against a judge on a page. The data, which was released by Google as part of its latest “transparency report”, relates to the period from 2010 to July 2018. Figures for requests from non-Government sources under the 2014 “right to be forgotten” rule are presented separately.

A Minister said Mr Ross’s public performance was not surprising given that he did not seem ‘up to speed’ on Brexit preparations in his own portfolio. Ministers have been privately scathing about the performance of Minister for Transport Shane Ross at a press conference this week where he suggested that checks would be needed on the Border after Brexit.Mr Ross attended the press conference with Tánaiste Simon Coveney and Minister for Health Simon Harris on the Government’s no-deal planning. At the event Mr Coveney quickly contradicted Mr Ross when the Dublin Rathdown TD said he expected checks on the Border if the UK exited the EU without an agreement.In a tape of a private conversation between the pair just as the press conference ended, Mr Coveney is heard telling Mr Ross: “Once you start talking about checks anywhere near the Border people will start delving into that, and all of a sudden we’ll be the Government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland. ” The Tánaiste also said border checks “could be at sea”. Mr Ross then said, “yeah, but I didn’t know what to say” .As well as the private exchange, Government sources also expressed surprise at Mr Ross’s handling of a number of questions from journalists.Mr Martin said the Government “must be honest with the Oireachtas and the people” on the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on Ireland’s politics, economic potential and social well being”. He called the taped conversation “deeply worrying”. The Government has consistently claimed it is not preparing to introduce a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic in any circumstances – deal or no deal. One Minister denied that Mr Ross was spelling out what the Government privately believed but does not want to disclose to the public. “It is not as if it was said in Cabinet and he was telling the truth,” said one Minister. “It was as if he didn’t even read his own documents.”The Cabinet this week approved memos from Mr Ross, Mr Harris and Mr Coveney on no-deal preparations in the areas of transport, health, the common travel area and how to get no-deal legislation though the Dáil.“This whole idea that, ‘oh, he is telling the truth’ is not correct,” the Minister added. Another said Mr Ross’s public performance was not surprising given that he did not seem as “up to speed” on Brexit preparations in his own portfolio that were expected. Government sources also expressed sympathy for the officials in the Department of Transport because of what was described as Mr Ross’s failure to adequately lead and oversee his department. “He wants to be Minister for Justice,” one source said. A spokeswoman for Minister Ross said the criticisms were sparked by his drink driving measures. “A handful of unnamed TDs from all parties have been spooked by the successful enforcement of the drink driving measures In recent weeks and are using any excuse to retaliate under the cloak of anonymity. “Lives are being saved and will continue to be. The Minister will not be deterred from pursuing this part of his portfolio.” She added: “Who are these ministers who whisper in the political twilight?”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Writing in The  in December, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that no-deal planning “will be the priority” of every Minister and secretary general.“All Government departments must give full priority to activating their plans for a no-deal or disorderly Brexit,” Mr Coveney wrote. The response appears to have been patchy. Some departments have been better than others. Some departments had to be. Some had little or no involvement. Others had been working for months on no-deal preparations. Insiders cited the Department of Health approvingly, where discussions with pharma companies and suppliers on maintaining supplies of drugs long preceded Coveney’s instruction. The Department of Foreign Affairs has been liaising with the British government on the common travel area, and has an agreement almost ready to be signed. The Department of Enterprise has been closely involved with industry, and ran a series of events last year. A central co-ordinating group recognised difficulties in specific areas last autumn. Chief among them was in the Department of Transport. The Minister at the department, Shane Ross, was widely criticised across Government for his performance at a press briefing on Tuesday, but insiders were critical of his department’s performance for months before that. “All over the place” is a frequent description of Brexit preparations there. Robert Watt, secretary general of the Department of Public Expenditure and one of the biggest beasts of the civil service jungle, was drafted in, and tasked with co-ordinating infrastructure requirements. Expansion of port facilities and new facilities at airports have since been identified, though little physical changes have been made at this stage. But other aspects of the preparations under the auspices of the Department of Transport have been sharply criticised by those familiar with the plans and also by those affected by them. One senior Government source says that most of the problems have been addressed, but the “landbridge” – the journey across Britain taken by Irish hauliers on their way to the continent –- remains a major uncertainty. Unusually, the hauliers’ organisation was willing to criticise Ross directly. “The Minister for Transport has no engagement,” said Verona Murphy, president of the Irish Road Haulage Association. “He has no interest in what we have to say. Everything is going to be an emergency measure now.” However, a spokeswoman for the Minister said he has always had the interest of the sector and IRHA members to the forefront. “His officials have engaged with the industry regularly and at length on issues affecting them including the likely effects of Brexit,” she said. “As a result of this engagement, the Minister and his Department have been informed of the priorities of the industry. This Government has secured an EU commission proposal for the continued connectivity arrangements for road haulage operators, preventing the industry coming to a standstill in the event of a no deal Brexit.”John McGrane, head of the British-Irish Chamber of Commerce, said he understood the reluctance politically to make no-deal preparations last year because the Government did not want to be seen to invite the possibility of a no-deal outcome. He said most large businesses, especially in highly regulated areas like finance and pharmaceuticals, have been making their own no-deal preparations. However, smaller business, such as agricultural and food suppliers, would be at the mercy of events. Outside Government departments and State agencies, concern has been expressed in the private sector at the lack of joined-up thinking to plan for a no-deal Brexit, and the reluctance of officials to sanction large-scale expenditure to prepare for an event that might not happen. “Civil servants are afraid to make a decision to recommend any expenditure to be delivered in case they end up at the Public Accounts Committee over it,” said one senior manager overseeing a key piece of State infrastructure that will be affected by Brexit. Across the Government there is a quiet admission that no-deal preparations in many areas are not as advanced as Ministers assert. Sources say there are good reasons for that. But they don’t seriously contest it. “In fairness, it’s hard to prepare when we have no idea what the Brits are going to do,” says one official. As of this week the Government is no nearer to knowing that.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorHandout via ReutersTheresa May’s belated engagement with opposition parties over Brexit ran into difficulties within minutes of its launch last night when Jeremy Corbyn refused to meet her until she ruled out leaving the European Union without a deal. The Labour leader’s spokesman described the threat of a no-deal Brexit as “a blackmail” that must be removed before meaningful talks about a new approach to Brexit could begin.The prime minister is under pressure from within her own party and her cabinet, as well as opposition MPs, to rule out a no-deal Brexit. But her official spokesman said last night that she was unwilling to do so, and during the debate on Labour’s no-confidence motion in her government she reaffirmed the red lines she laid down in her Lancaster House speech two years ago.“Our principles are clear: a deal that delivers a smooth and orderly exit, protecting our union, giving us control of our borders, laws and money and allowing us to operate an independent trade policy. These are what deliver on the will of the British people,” she said.Downing Street confirmed that the prime minister believes that an independent trade policy is incompatible with membership of a customs union. And her spokesman said she continues to believe that Britain should leave the EU on March 29th, which would appear to rule out an extension of the article 50 negotiating deadline.Labour’s Yvette Cooper said May’s inflexibility was bewildering in the light of Tuesday’s defeat of her Brexit deal by the largest margin in parliamentary history.“The problem is that she seems to be talking as if she lost by 30 votes yesterday and not 230. Her refusal even to consider changing any of her red lines, when the EU, the Irish Government and others made it clear that the deal that she got was dependent on those red lines, is making this impossible,” Cooper said.The prime minister’s caution about moving her red lines reflects the precariousness of her position even after surviving last night’s no-confidence vote. To win a majority for a Brexit deal she needs to make concessions that will secure the votes of opposition MPs who want a softer Brexit. But moving too far risks losing moderate Conservative Brexiteers and eliminates her chances of wooing back some hardliners who voted against her deal on Tuesday.Despite their stand-off last night, May and Corbyn both oppose a no-deal Brexit but neither wants to reverse the outcome of the 2016 referendum. Between them they could unlock a majority in the House of Commons for a Brexit deal, and if they hesitate, MPs from both their parties will seek to create such a majority without them.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Jessica TaylorAFPGetty ImagesFor most of the debate on Labour’s motion of no confidence in the British government, the green benches were largely empty as backbenchers delivered dull, predictable speeches. There was a moment of excitement halfway through when John Woodcock, a former Labour MP who now sits as an Independent, said he would not support the motion because he believed Jeremy Corbyn was unfit for office.The Labour leader opened the debate with a catalogue of Theresa May’s government’s failings, from Brexit to child poverty, education and health. But his attack was blunted by his failure to answer questions about Labour’s Brexit policy – notably on whether the party would campaign in favour of Brexit or against it in the election he was hoping to trigger.And the very thought of a Corbyn government was enough to remind Conservatives that there was one person in the Commons chamber they disliked more than they loathed one another.“The leader of the opposition is making some powerful arguments – not very well, but he is making them – but could he help us with this?” said anti-Brexit Conservative Anna Soubry.“I saw an opinion poll at the weekend. If there is any merit in his arguments, can he explain why the Conservative Party is six points ahead in the polls? Could it be because he is the most hopeless leader of the opposition we have ever had?”The prime minister listed what she saw as her government’s achievements before moving on to the safer territory of attacking Corbyn’s character. But she too faced difficult questions over Brexit, particularly over her resistance to abandoning any of her red lines as she sought to find a proposal that MPs could unite behind.Earlier, during prime minister’s questions, former Conservative chancellor Ken Clarke told her that the debate on her Brexit deal had revealed the shape of a potential majority.“It seemed to me that the only clear majorities in this House on a cross-party basis are against leaving with no deal in favour of extending article 50 to give us time to sort out what we now propose to do and in favour of some form of customs union and sufficient regulatory alignment to keep all our borders between the United Kingdom and the European Union open after we leave,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Will the prime minister not accept, just as I have had to accept that the majority in this House is committed to the UK leaving the European Union, that she must now modify her red lines, which she created for herself at Lancaster House, and find a cross-party majority, which will be along the lines that I have indicated?”Labour’s deputy leader, Tom Watson, wound up the debate for his party and he made the case against the prime minister more effectively than Corbyn had. He said he did not question her motives and believed she was driven by a sense of public duty.“I do not doubt that she has sincerely attempted to fulfil the task given to us by the voters in this referendum. I have no doubt too that she has tried her best and given it her all. But she has failed, and I am afraid the failure is hers and hers alone. I am certain that every member of this House admires her resilience. To suffer the humiliations on a global stage that she has done would have finished off weaker people far sooner. Yet the reality is that, if the prime minister really sat down and thought carefully about the implications for our country of last night’s defeat, she would have resigned,” he said.Environment secretary Michael Gove closed the debate for the government, and after a brisk recital of its achievements, he turned his fire on Corbyn. Gove was cruel, tendentious and unfair as he exaggerated and distorted the Labour leader’s record – and also quite brilliant, as the roars from the benches behind him attested.The government defeated the motion by 19 votes, but without the support of the DUP’s 10 votes it would have lost by one.“The result of the motion of no confidence tonight illustrates the importance of the confidence-and-supply arrangement,” Nigel Dodds said with a sweet, only slightly menacing smile.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Michael ReynoldSEPAOppressive regimes hide economic inequalities with bread and circuses. The US does it with a mere idea: classlessness. It explains the national self-image of social mobility that data, as is its impertinent wont, tends to refute. An elite need not be defined by accent or blood to be as ossified as any Old World aristocracy.As far back as 1828, when they elected the anti-patrician Andrew Jackson, the first president from outside the Virginia or Massachusetts gentry, Americans were aware of entrenched, self-perpetuating privilege. The historian Nancy Isenberg has waded yet deeper into the annals, charting 400 years of antagonism to do with rank and status that began with the earliest settlers.Americans should face up to their own class consciousness. They should, in fact, embrace it. Class has the potential to ide and embitter, no doubt, but democratic politics has to be contested on some faultline or other. This one feels less fraught than the rifts over race, gender and sexuality that make up what we know, for want of a better euphemism, as identity politics.It is a matter of numbers. A crude campaign against the 1 per cent would put, at least in theory, all other Americans on the same side. A more viable politics of class would be subtler than that, of course, pitting the top quintile, say, against the middle, which itself would look down (in both senses) at the poor. But even this triage of voters into economic interest groups implies some coherence and manageability. A small number of big blocs would vie for influence. The nation would not be as one – which nation is? – but nor would it splinter into all that many shards.Identity politics can bring a more thoroughgoing fragmentation. In a country as erse as the US, the number of ethnic groups – to take just that form of identity – will always exceed the number of social classes. To vote, as Christopher Hitchens once put it, “with the epidermis”, is to invite an endless subision of the electorate. And this does not even reckon with the criss-crossing variables of sex, sexual preference, religion and language.Identity politics is not always and everywhere a folly. Without it, minorities, to say nothing of women, would go without basic freedoms. Classical liberals might rather they pressed their case as citizens first, as per the republican ideal. But when black Americans did just that, from the 1800s onward, the state refused them. Nor is the conflation of “identity politics” with “the left” excusable any more, if it ever was. The right brims with the stuff, from the most respectable grievances against the pace of immigration to the conspiracy theories of the alt-right. What is Republican congressman Steve King, evicted from the judiciary committee for his blood-and-soil sentiments, if not an identity politician?Class is difficult to unpick from race. But politicians still get to choose which to emphasise in their rhetoricThe question is not the rightness or wrongness of identity politics in principle. The question is how much of it a nation of uncountable identities can possibly absorb. At some point, does it deform the principle of inidual equality before the state into something nearer to consociationalism – group-by-group rights for the sake of social peace? Belgium and Northern Ireland are fine places, but at some variance with the original American ideal.Class is difficult to unpick from race. But politicians still get to choose which to emphasise in their rhetoric. It is a small mercy that, outside the part-closure of the government, the biggest political interventions of the year so far have majored on class. Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez floated a 70 per cent tax rate on the rich. Fox News host Tucker Carlson scolded the capitalist “ruling class” in a straight-to-camera monologue. There was a glibness to each statement. But an inclusiveness, too. Americans of all kinds fit into the “middle class” or the “99 per cent”. That is not true of all sectarian groupings.If there is one thing to be salvaged from Marxist thought – and, really, I must insist on just the one – it is relative indifference to matters of blood. The stress was always on material interest as the motor of history. By rejecting Marx, the US remained free and prosperous, but also defenceless against identity neuroses.How telling that it was Bernie Sanders, a socialist, who blamed Hillary Clinton’s defeat in 2016 on a fixation with such things. The “fight of today”, he said, is against the “oligarchy”. The senator for Vermont sees a class-based politics as good for the party. A better argument is that it is good for the US. A democratic nation has to fall out over something. Exactly what, it must choose with the most enormous care. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward.

These can result in companies being fined up to $525,000 (£291,000) and the poster being fined up to $105,000 (£58,273).Asked about whether the government was considering the Australian model, Baroness Williams said: “One of the things that we always do is look to see what other countries are doing and certainly we are looking into it in the white paper.“Nothing is off the table in terms of what we are looking at in terms of the white paper.”Her comments come as the minister also said social media companies needed to do more to stop people with facial disfigurement and visible conditions being abused online.The charity Changing Faces, which campaigns for people visible differences, said many had experienced abuse online with some having their picture taken in public so they can be mocked on social media.Baroness Williams, who is working with the charity on the issue, said: “I think the responses (from social media companies) are sporadic. Just because something doesn’t meet a legal threshold there are still the terms of user conditions that they have.“Also I think for the social media companies there is a reputational risk here. Social media was actually developed for very positive reasons and we don’t want it to become a platform which certain people can’t go near because of some of the bile that is spat out with a cloak of anonymity.”Becky Hewitt, the CEO of Changing Faces, said social media could be a positive place for people with visible conditions, but that abuse was putting them off.That charity has found that a third do not use their photo on their profile and that some people had had their online photos taken and turned into hurtful memes.She added: “One of the things that people often talk to us about is people taking their photos and without their permission when they are out and about.“So one of our champions talks about a time that she was in the car with her brother and her mum and someone stuck a phone in to get a photo of her and then that can be used on social media as a form of bullying. It is those kind of things that are quite common.”There have been some positive steps taken by social media companies to combat the abuse, such as by Twitter, which has now given Changing Faces special status to report incidents.However Ms Hewitt said many people facing abuse still felt a sense of “resignation” when it came to social media companies taking action.The charity is calling for the government to officially recognise abuse against people with visible conditions in the white paper.Natalie Ambersley, a 36-year-old PA from London who has the skin condition vitiligo, told the : “People don’t realise how damaging and upsetting it can be for that person, so social media platforms should make it a priority.“It can have a really negative impact on how people see themselves.”Department for Culture, Media \u0026amp SportPlease review our commenting policyUK weather: Snow and ice warnings issued as freezing conditions grip countryBrexit latest news: Theresa May holds cross-party talks in bid to break deadlock as Jeremy Corbyn refuses to meet PMBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitComment: Tory Remainers have a duty not to destroy their party and let in CorbynNo confidence vote result: Theresa May survives but is snubbed by Jeremy Corbyn over cross-party Brexit talksDonald Trump\u0026#39s new missile defence strategy eyes space-based sensorsRevealed: the best age to get orced to protect your children\u0026#39s mental healthComment: Trump sees himself as a tough negotiator, so don\u0026#39t expect any favours negotiating a trade dealComment: No deal does not preclude smaller arrangements to smooth our departure from the EUComment: I\u0026#39m no Brexit expert, but I do know the importance of sticking to a deadlineNorth Korea’s \u0026#39world-class\u0026#39 beach resort nears completion - but will the tourists come?Comment: Why Labour MPs could regret trying to call Corbyn\u0026#39s bluff on backing a Second ReferendumRudy Giuliani:  \u0026#39I never said there was no collusion\u0026#39 with RussiaSmartphones overtake shopping centres as a popular way to shopChildren risk falling behind by age four because nursery teachers are poorly educated, report suggests Gove writes his own obituary, as Brexiteers insist that their moment is about to arrive\u0026#39Planetary health diet\u0026#39: Britons urged to cut meat intake to equivalent of one beefburger a fortnightExclusive: The Government’s conference call to reassure big business - the full transcriptWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"micro needles could future long lasting contraception","story":"An experimental microneedle patch is shown next to a blister pack of birth control pillsA temporary patch which leaves hundreds of tiny needles under a patient’s skin could be used to deliver long-lasting contraception, a study has found. Designed to be self-administered, the technology would give women with limited and irregular access to healthcare more control over family planning, particularly in developing countries. The patch contains at least 100 microneedles, which are attached to a small disc of plastic. When sideways pressure is applied these tiny needles detach from the plastic backing, remaining under the surface of the skin. Made from biodegradable materials naturally found in human bodies, the needles slowly disintegrate while releasing a hormone, levonorgestrel, which has been used in contraception for decades. “The microneedles feel as if you’ve taken velcro and press it against your skin,” said Mark Prausnitz, professor at Georgia Institute of Technology and the corresponding author on the research paper. “Most people don’t find it painful – it doesn’t come with a strong or sharp sensation like an injection would.” Population: Prevalence of any method of contraceptionThe experimental technology was originally developed to provide an injection free way of administering vaccines, with rapidly dissolving needles that release the drug and disappear within minutes. The micro-needles were found to be just as effective as traditional injected vaccines in clinical trials, but were preferred by the vast majority of people involved. Trials to use the technology for diabetes treatment have also been positive. Now research published in Nature Biomedical Engineering journal suggests micro-needle patches can also be used to slowly release contraceptives. In rats, a high level of the contraceptive hormone was sustained for over a month. “There’s a real need around the world to improve access to contraception,” said Prof Prausnitz. “Long acting contraception is appealing as compliance is easier  for instance, you don’t have to remember to take a pill.But self-administered contraception could be of great use where women don’t have any access to healthcare, he added.  A larger contraceptive patch has been developed to use in humans, but not yet tested. As the patch remains in the early stages of development scientists are not yet sure of the cost, though Prof Prausnitz said that he thought it would be similar to existing birth control options.He added that he hoped the team would develop microneedles that last for six months, not one, which would further reduce the cost. But while the team are excited about the potential of the patches, it is likely to be at least five years before they are available for women to use. Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of article Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security UK weather: Snow and ice warnings issued as freezing conditions grip countryBrexit latest news: Theresa May holds cross-party talks in bid to break deadlock as Jeremy Corbyn refuses to meet PMBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitComment: Tory Remainers have a duty not to destroy their party and let in CorbynNo confidence vote result: Theresa May survives but is snubbed by Jeremy Corbyn over cross-party Brexit talksDonald Trump\u0026#39s new missile defence strategy eyes space-based sensorsRevealed: the best age to get orced to protect your children\u0026#39s mental healthComment: I\u0026#39m no Brexit expert, but I do know the importance of sticking to a deadlineComment: Trump sees himself as a tough negotiator, so don\u0026#39t expect any favours negotiating a trade dealNorth Korea’s \u0026#39world-class\u0026#39 beach resort nears completion - but will the tourists come?Comment: No deal does not preclude smaller arrangements to smooth our departure from the EUComment: Why Labour MPs could regret trying to call Corbyn\u0026#39s bluff on backing a Second ReferendumRudy Giuliani:  \u0026#39I never said there was no collusion\u0026#39 with RussiaSmartphones overtake shopping centres as a popular way to shopChildren risk falling behind by age four because nursery teachers are poorly educated, report suggests Gove writes his own obituary, as Brexiteers insist that their moment is about to arrive\u0026#39Planetary health diet\u0026#39: Britons urged to cut meat intake to equivalent of one beefburger a fortnightExclusive: The Government’s conference call to reassure big business - the full transcriptWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no pants subway ride 2019 pictures","story":"First things first.. pants as in trousers, the American usage !

I have nothing but gratitude, he told reporters on Wednesday.  Yokozuna Kisenosato wipes tears during his retirement press conference I was gradually recovering, but I was unable to wrestle in my own style, he added.His retirement from the sport leaves just two remaining wrestlers at the elite level, Hakuho Sho and Kakuryu Rikisaburo, both of whom are from Mongolia.The sport has been hit by falling numbers of Japanese competitors in recent years, in part because of the demanding lifestyle it requires as well as the rising popularity of sports such as football.Sumo wrestling | Six things to knowYoung sumo hopefuls train in tightly-knit stables - eating, sleeping and practising together and are sometimes subjected to harsh treatment in the belief that it will toughen them up.In 2007, one trainee died after he was allegedly beaten by his master and three other wrestlers after he attempted to flee his stable.The sport has seen a string of scandals in recent years, including allegations of abuse, drug-taking and sexism.Last year Harumafuji Kahei, a Mongolian yokozuna, resigned weeks after he was accused of assaulting a fellow wrestler. Kisenosato decided to retire after three straight losses at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in TokyoA new generation of female wrestlers are fighting to overturn ancient traditions around the sport which decree that only men can compete and women are seen as \u0027unclean\u0027.Kisenosato, who will be adopting the name of Araiso as a sumo elder, is expected to become a coach to budding wrestlers hoping for success. His decision to retire comes after he suffered eight successive losses, the worst run for a grand champion since the current competition format began in 1949.The champion made his professional debut in 2002, when he was just 16, and reached Japan\u0027s top ision, Makuuchi, at the age of 18. His elevation to the elite rank, which requires a tournament victory, did not come until 2017. The sport is struggling to recruit home-born talent in Japan He went on to win his first tournament as a yokozuna in 2018, but ever since his progress has been marred by a chest injury.The injury prevented him from playing in eight straight tournaments, the worst record of any grand champion. He returned to the elite level last September but a string of eight losses has led to him to withdraw from professional sumo wrestling.I was delighted when he became yokozuna but when you see him closely, you can tell that he was struggling a lot. These two years went like a flash, his stable master Tagonoura Oyakata said yesterday.He made a big decision. I can tell straight away by looking at his face that there were many thoughts on his mind.I personally cannot take it in.Please review our commenting policyUK weather: Snow and ice warnings issued as freezing conditions grip countryBrexit latest news: Theresa May holds cross-party talks in bid to break deadlock as Jeremy Corbyn refuses to meet PMBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitComment: Tory Remainers have a duty not to destroy their party and let in CorbynNo confidence vote result: Theresa May survives but is snubbed by Jeremy Corbyn over cross-party Brexit talksDonald Trump\u0026#39s new missile defence strategy eyes space-based sensorsRevealed: the best age to get orced to protect your children\u0026#39s mental healthComment: I\u0026#39m no Brexit expert, but I do know the importance of sticking to a deadlineComment: Trump sees himself as a tough negotiator, so don\u0026#39t expect any favours negotiating a trade dealNorth Korea’s \u0026#39world-class\u0026#39 beach resort nears completion -

It’s all a big fat hoax.In the first report, The New York Times said the FBI opened an investigation into whether Mr Trump was acting on Russia’s behalf soon after he became president.Meanwhile, The Washington Post detailed what it said were the unusual lengths taken by Mr Trump to hide the contents of his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Both men’s comments come as Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation looms large in the background, punctuated by guilty pleas, convictions and indictments of former Trump associates.These include his former national security advisor Michael Flynn, former Trump campaign chief Paul Manafort and Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen.Manafort has admitted to sharing polling data with a Russian during the 2016 presidential race, according to a court filing inadvertently made public by his lawyers. CNN reported that the intended recipients were two pro-Russia Ukrainian oligarchs.But on Wednesday, Mr Giuliani suggested that was not collusion.Polling data is given to everybody, he told CNN.Please review our commenting policyUK weather: Snow and ice warnings issued as freezing conditions grip countryBrexit latest news: Theresa May holds cross-party talks in bid to break deadlock as Jeremy Corbyn refuses to meet PMBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitComment: Tory Remainers have a duty not to destroy their party and let in CorbynNo confidence vote result: Theresa May survives but is snubbed by Jeremy Corbyn over cross-party Brexit talksDonald Trump\u0026#39s new missile defence strategy eyes space-based sensorsRevealed: the best age to get orced to protect your children\u0026#39s mental healthComment: I\u0026#39m no Brexit expert, but I do know the importance of sticking to a deadlineComment: Trump sees himself as a tough negotiator, so don\u0026#39t expect any favours negotiating a trade dealNorth Korea’s \u0026#39world-class\u0026#39 beach resort nears completion - but will the tourists come?Comment: No deal does not preclude smaller arrangements to smooth our departure from the EUComment: Why Labour MPs could regret trying to call Corbyn\u0026#39s bluff on backing a Second ReferendumSmartphones overtake shopping centres as a popular way to shopChildren risk falling behind by age four because nursery teachers are poorly educated, report suggests Gove writes his own obituary, as Brexiteers insist that their moment is about to arrive\u0026#39Planetary health diet\u0026#39: Britons urged to cut meat intake to equivalent of one beefburger a fortnightExclusive: The Government’s conference call to reassure big business - the full transcriptSNP guilty of \u0026#39crooked politics\u0026#39 over proposed second EU referendum question, says former deputy leaderWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"smartphones overtake shopping centres popular way shop","story":"More than 30 million Brits (58 per cent) will use smart devices to shop this year, an increase of 12 million, or 66 per cent compared to 2018Retail and Consumer industrySmartphones have for the first time overtaken shopping centres as a popular way to shop, figures show. Shoppers are planning to spend £25 billion using their smartphones this year in what will be a £10 billion rise on 2018, switching firm Uswitch found. More than 30 million Brits (58 per cent) will use smart devices to shop this year, an increase of 12 million, or 66 per cent compared to 2018, it found.This compares to 56 per cent of people who will visit a shopping centre this year.Meanwhile fewer people are visiting shopping centres, with separate data from BRC Springboard showing that footfall declined by 3.9 per cent in December, despite shops offering huge discounts.It comes as the popularity of smartphone and tablet shopping is being driven by convenience, created by payment facilities like Apple Pay which lets shoppers spend money in a single click.Footfall in shopping centres is declining, while smartphone shopping is on the rise Shoppers are also being tempted by links and adverts on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. One in every five pounds spent in shops now comes via online payments, with the figure rising every year. Shoppers told USwitch they liked shopping on a smartphone because they could do so at any time, while easily comparing prices and seeing a superior level of choice. Shopping also said they felt they could get the best value online. Clothes are by far the most popular product bought online (69 per cent) ahead of books (51 per cent), groceries (47 per cent) and theatre or cinema tickets (43 per cent). Ru Bhikha, mobiles expert at uSwitch, says: “For so many of us now, our smartphone is an extension of our hand and we have it with us at all times, meaning that we can shop whenever and wherever we like. Our handsets allow us to window shop all the time, and if we see something we like, it is right there at our fingertips.“With smartphone and tablet shopping now a £25 billion industry, it’s hardly surprising that  major retailers have long adopted a mobile-first approach to their websites and have even introduced their own apps to make the user experience as easy as possible.Cleaner user journeys and the ease of one-click purchasing will only add to the number of people shopping on their phones and tablets.Retail and Consumer industryUK weather: Snow and ice warnings issued as freezing conditions grip countryBrexit latest news: Theresa May holds cross-party talks in bid to break deadlock as Jeremy Corbyn refuses to meet PMBrexit: What\u0026#39s next now Theresa May has survived no-confidence vote?What \u0026#39no deal\u0026#39 Brexit really means, and how it would affect daily life in the UKExclusive: Philip Hammond tells business chiefs MPs will stop no-deal BrexitComment: Tory Remainers have a duty not to destroy their party and let in CorbynNo confidence vote result: Theresa May survives but is snubbed by Jeremy Corbyn over cross-party Brexit talksDonald Trump\u0026#39s new missile defence strategy eyes space-based sensorsRevealed: the best age to get orced to protect your children\u0026#39s mental healthComment: I\u0026#39m no Brexit expert, but I do know the importance of sticking to a deadlineComment: Trump sees himself as a tough negotiator, so don\u0026#39t expect any favours negotiating a trade dealNorth Korea’s \u0026#39world-class\u0026#39 beach resort nears completion - but will the tourists come?Comment: No deal does not preclude smaller arrangements to smooth our departure from the EUComment: Why Labour MPs could regret trying to call Corbyn\u0026#39s bluff on backing a Second ReferendumRudy Giuliani:  \u0026#39I never said there was no collusion\u0026#39 with RussiaChildren risk falling behind by age four because nursery teachers are poorly educated, report suggests Gove writes his own obituary, as Brexiteers insist that their moment is about to arrive\u0026#39Planetary health diet\u0026#39: Britons urged to cut meat intake to equivalent of one beefburger a fortnightExclusive: The Government’s conference call to reassure big business - the full transcriptSNP guilty of \u0026#39crooked politics\u0026#39 over proposed second EU referendum question, says former deputy leaderWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/12/20/rtx3fx9s-0.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-5737761  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/12/20/rtx3fx9s-0.jpg","title":"apple airpods sold out availability stores online new version released wireless headphones","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

At last, the endless miles of too-soft carpet, like ploughing through snow but with an extra helping of static, have been rolled up again.As shows go, this was a good one, with plenty of innovation, some stunning products and, of course, the nuttiest gadgets on the planet.The just-revealed products will arrive in stores over the coming months. Here are some of the best devices to look forward to.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThis gadget manages to be both mainstream and quirky. It’s a wireless speaker (Bluetooth and Wi-Fi) with a delicate, beguiling tone that is highly attractive.But it looks like something Florence Nightingale might carry because it has a glass cylinder growing out of it, with a light at its base.In fact, the glass vibrates and its resonance is what creates the sonorous sound.The light can even be set to flicker like a candle. It is perfect for romantic candlelit dinners, though it’s not cheap: £550.This was far from the only TV launched at CES but many of them seemed highly gimmicky: The LG rollable TV is plenty impressive and the Samsung 219-inch microLED screen called, appropriately enough, The Wall, looked just amazing.But for a TV you can actually buy without breaking the bank, the GZ2000 was revelatory. The image quality on Panasonic is routinely outstanding, and there were certainly improvements over previous models.But this is a Dolby Atmos TV, and the first with upward-firing speakers hidden behind the screen.In action, these transformed the experience, creating a deeply immersive sound, especially when watching sport. The roar of the crowd was no longer just coming from in front of you.Withings makes spectacularly good health products and its smartwatches appeal because they have analogue hands like, you know, a real watch.This latest model, out in the Spring, will include an ECG monitor, something only the Apple Watch Series 4 has, and only in the US for now. This will be rather cheaper, at £130.An ECG reading occurs when you press on the watch glass (there’s another sensor pressing against your wrist on the watch’s back that completes the circuit).The Withings watch has a secondary dial which shows how close you are to your steps target, too. Oh, and unlike the Apple Watch, this will be compatible with Android phones, too.This was one of the coolest surprises at the show and comes from Sphero, makers of spherical robots and a brilliant Star Wars R2-D2 toy.But the company’s toys have always had a considerable educational angle to them, encouraging youngsters to learn how to code, for instance.Now, with Specdrums, there’s a musical angle, too. Two silicone rings fit to your fingers and when you touch a colour, then notes, loops or beats will sound.The colours can be on the coloured pad that comes with the rings or things in the world around you. Very smart.Back in the seventies, Technics released a turntable designed for DJs. It was incredibly popular and highly praised because it was well-built, very reliable and easy to use.There have been updates since then but this is the first for almost a decade.The new model, in a cool matte-black finish, includes features such as the capability to spin the disc in the opposite direction and neat features such as a long-life white LED positioned to make it easier to see the stylus tip when you’re trying to place it in dim, or no, light. It goes on sale in around May for £900.CES 2019: Chinese firms and US government among conference no showsA smartphone with a flexible screen that folds out to become a tablet, this was a hot gadget in Vegas.But it will need to move quickly to work – Samsung has said its own folder will be out in the coming months.There are certain issues with folding phones, such as the aspect ratio. A regular display looks almost square when unfolded or, for it to look like a regular tablet, it requires a wider-than-usual display when in phone mode. But it’s a sign of the future.This comes from the company that made the Nuraphone, a pair of headphones that go over the ear and also have a bit that juts into your lugholes to deliver strong sound.The NuraLoop is an in-ear headphone which, like the Nuraphone, measures your hearing and uses signal processing to adjust the output to suit your ears, personally.There’s noise-cancelling on board and a social mode that lets the sound of the outside world out as much or as little as you’d like.A pet feeder is straightforward enough, but what if it had facial recognition? So Fido doesn’t eat Tibbles’ food, for instance.This is also useful if you have two dogs, say, with different dietary needs.Or, if you leave the Mookkie in the garden, you can be sure that a stray cat won’t sneak in and eat it.There are two food bowls with separately opening lids. It’s on sale in the autumn for around £160.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year,” said Mike Hardie of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialTransport fuel prices were up 3.4 per cent year-on-year in December, well down from the 12 per cent growth rate in the middle of last year.No-deal Brexit will mean lost jobs and lower wages says BoE governorThe global oil price currently stands at $60.7 a barrel, down from $86 in October.The average price for a litre of unleaded petrol in the UK currently stands at 120p, down from a recent peak of 131p last autumn.However, the ONS also reported on Wednesday that core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose to 1.9 per cent in December, up from 1.8 per cent in November.The Bank of England signalled last year that it sees underlying inflationary pressure in the UK economy, despite the uncertainty over Brexit, which is likely to prompt it to increase the cost of borrowing over the next two years.But analysts said the latest prices data suggested there was no need for rapid action.“We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action,” said Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.Inflation spiked to a peak of 3.1 per cent in 2017, mainly due to the record slump in sterling in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum, which pushed up firms’ import costs.Analysts have warned that the pound could plummet again if the UK crashes out of the European Union with no deal in March.Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, warned in November that one of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit will likely be another spike in the cost of living.Separately, the ONS said that UK house price growth was 2.8 per cent in the year to November, up slightly from the 2.7 per cent rate in October, but well down from the 8 per cent growth rates seen before the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite the fact that inflation fell to a two-year low of 2.1 per cent in December, this is much higher than the Bank of England’s base interest rate of 0.75 per cent. Most banks fail to match the central bank’s rate with their easy access savings accounts, which offered an average of 0.23 per cent in 2018, according to figures compiled by Gatehouse Bank.The research shows that savers relying on easy access accounts would have suffered a real terms loss of £19 on deposits of £1,000, £37 on savings of £2,000, £94 on a lump sum of £5,000 and £468 on £25,000.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBased on an average nest egg of £26,403, using the most recent figures from Sun Life, inflation would have led to a loss of £494. Charles Haresnape, CEO of Gatehouse Bank, said: “Savings rates are slowly creeping up but inflation is still taking a huge bite out of savings held in easy access accounts. Millions of savers will undoubtedly have found that in 2018 they received a substantial negative ‘real’ return on their hard-earned savings, when the impact of inflation is taken in to account. UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallWhich banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Rising interest rates will not yet lead to another financial crashSavers keeping their money in cash would have lost out to an greater degree - the average nest egg would have lost £554.\u0026nbsp“Those looking to drive a real increase in their savings need to be on the front foot in looking for better returns to prevent their nest eggs from shrinking. Many instant access savings rates are still at rock bottom and no one can afford to leave a significant amount of cash lying around for inflation to swoop on.“There are many more accounts savers should consider, from fixed-term to notice accounts, which offer greater returns and won’t leave them as vulnerable to the impact of inflation, like easy access rates.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile, savers were dealt a double blow as analysts said the latest inflation data indicated the BoE could take its time over raising interest rates. Meanwhile, Howard Archer of the EY Item Club said: “We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The band appear reinvigorated, brimming with energy and self-assurance.Brent Cobb’s music is built around people and places. The country artist returns after the release of his acclaimed 2016 album Shine On Rainy Day with Providence Canyon a slice of blue-collar country offering fresh tales of Southern lifeThe Brighton metal band’s sublime second album is their most ambitious to date. Enlisting Adrian Bushby (Foo Fighters, Muse) on production was a master-stroke – with his help they offer up vast sonic landscapes that recall the drama of Darion Malakian’s Scars on Broadway record, DictatorOne moment opining the joys of leaving a party to pluck your eyebrows, the next raging over the gaslighting of assault survivors, Miya Folick’s debut album continues her habit of cracking the shiny veneer of pop, and unsettling the exceptions put upon a feminine voiceThough their themes remain in the gutter, Suede aspire to monuments, and The Blue Hour will stand as another sordid masterworkSix years after the release of her last LP Sun, Cat Power – whose struggles with alcoholism, addiction and mental health issues have been much publicised – demonstrates “both a newfound sense of calm, and strength” on her new albumHoly Hell offers up some of the best tracks of the band’s career, with a through-line that maintains Tom Searle\u0027s role as an integral part of Architects, particularly on “Doomsday”, while “Hereafter” feels like the song that launches the album’s momentum. Listening to vocalist Sam Carter scream: “I wasn’t braced for the fallout” is intensely cathartic – even non-metal fans will find it hard not to be moved by the band’s sincerity. (RO)Even in discarding such basic pop necessities as melody, Robyn has managed to create a masterpiece. With her first album in seven years, the Swedish singer delivers nine songs that glow and pulse with bittersweet sensuality, sung in a voice that sifts over the synths like icing sugar1040 31. Florence \u0026amp the Machine - High as HopeOn Florence \u0026amp The Machine’s latest album High As Hope, her voice is just as powerful when she holds back. She seems to attribute much of this calmness to her new-found sobriety – she quit alcohol a few years ago and looks back on her twenties with a mix of fondness and regret1140 30. Teyana Taylor - Keep that Same EnergyShe’s not restricted by genre constraints, and K.T.S.E. (Keep That Same Energy) is a pleasant surprise. Embellished with producer Kanye West’s keen ear for samples, it blends Eighties nostalgia with fresh rap and R\u0026ampB. At the core of the project is Taylor’s love of pleasing herself, her relationship with her husband, and being a mother1240 29. The 1975 – A Brief Inquiry into Online RelationshipsOn their third and best album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, The 1975 have created what so many post-Radiohead bands couldn’t: a coherent pop statement with enough hope, radical honesty and genre-ning breadth to make sense across ided generations1340 28. Kamasi Washington - Heaven and EarthFor a new generation, Kamasi Washington is largely responsible for the revitalised interest in jazz in modern music, most notably with his work on Kendrick Lamar’s jazz-heavy masterpiece, To Pimp a Butterfly. On Heaven and Earth, the Los Angeles saxophonist and band leader splits his second record in two halves: the urgent Earth side explores reality while Heaven deals in dreamy opulenceThe 21-year-old south London MC Novelist’s debut album is a clear, concise look at the current social and political landscape of the UK, offering up astute observations on black masculinity and the music industry along the way.The German composer’s 10th solo album is a stirring, complex work that draws on the concept of connection a fluidity in the way the universe worksCamila Cabello\u0027s debut solo album is the first time fans have been able to see her clearlyOn Mitski\u0027s brilliant fifth album she is desperate and lonely one minute, hardened and withdrawn the next. Her music, which exists in a space between fierce, guitar-led walls of noise and soft, delicate balladry, feels like an open wound – and Be The Cowboy is no different. (AP)Frontman Olly Alexander is offering fans their own generational pop icon: a young man who has the courage to put all of that vibrant, dynamic character on full displayOn Tell Me How You Really Feel, Courtney Barnett turns her keen eye inwards, exploring anxiety and depression while coming to terms with her own emotional life. Written as her burgeoning stature and hectic touring schedule began to take their toll, these 10 songs are Barnett’s attempt to work through her vulnerability and sadnessFor Negro Swan, Blood Orange’s fourth album, the multi-instrumentalist has dreamed up a 16-song suite that weaves together impressionist psych-pop and interstellar funk, late-Seventies Marvin Gaye and early-Eighties Prince, with some tangled ballads and insomniac blues reminiscent of Elliott Smith and King Krule thrown into the pot2140 20. Cardi B - Invasion of PrivacyWhen she sings off the hook, it’s just another moment where Cardi B runs to her own rhythm: because nothing about Invasion of Privacy is formulaicWith producer SOPHIE on board (whose own album, also released this year, is well worth your time), they explore the anxieties and frustrations of being a teenage girl through clattering beats and Nokia samples. The result is exceptionalGhetts re-evaluates much of what he said on Ghetto Gospel, when he was frustrated and angry with the world. Now he looks more to the future, whether on “Next of Kin”, where he speaks from the perspective of a mother carrying her child’s coffin, or “Black Rose”, which addresses fears for his daughter in a society that places double standards on black women. It’s a reminder that grime is so much more than violence and threats. (RO)2440 17. Cypress Hill – Elephants on AcidElephants on Acid is a 21-track monster, loaded with twists and turns that take you as far as Egypt, where Muggs recorded much of “Band of Gypsies” – teaming up with artists on oud, sitar, keyboard and guitar, as well as some of its street musicians. Its lead hook harks back to the glitchy shrieks of “How I Could Just Kill a Man” from their eponymous 1991 debut.His brilliant fourth album Love Is Magic takes listeners on a similar thrill ride, dominated by swirling loops of grand, romantic melody, sly twists of sardonic wit and heart-stopping drops of sheer honestyHis third record, produced entirely by Kanye West, could easily have been an EP, coming in at just seven songs and 21 minutes. While many fans were disappointed by the erratic and self-indulgent nature of some of West’s other releases, including his own album ye, the beats on Daytona are sample-heavy and superb the instrumentation is sparse but all the more impactful for itSince her debut single – the AK Paul-featuring “So Good” – was released in 2014, London-based singer-songwriter NAO has hovered around a near-perfect brand of sultry, neo-soul-inflected R\u0026ampB. Four years later, and she seems to have mastered itThe third solo album from the US artist stars an overwhelming number of (uncredited) guest features, producers and co-writers, but, ultimately, it’s his own, most career-defining work to date. Bloom captures the A to Z’s of modern queer love with pinpoint precisionHoward’s music has always, above all, reflected the shifts and moods in nature, while he sings poetic lyrics in his signature low, warm murmur. On Noonday Dream, he expands on the Cornish landscape that impacted his earlier work and brings in sounds and instruments that spark the imagination for places further afield, in the most exquisite way3140 10. Shame – Songs of PraiseDistinguishing themselves from the hordes of other white, indie guitar bands that emerged around summer 2017, south London natives Shame manage to make raw, bleeding anger on their debut album sound articulate.Gaika broke new ground on the UK music scene and asserted himself as one of the most provocative and multitalented young artists of this generation with his debut album, Basic VolumeTamino’s music on his debut Amir draws on the old-world romance of his grandfather – a famous Arabic musician and actor ¬– but also embodies the genre-less quality of much modern pop. The musical heritage that is so essential to the 22-year-old’s sound comes to life in the dramatic, sweeping instrumentation on a song like “So It Goes” haunting, graceful violins, bold drum beats and the shimmer of a tambourine transport the listener entirely.Mac Miller turned his anguish into one of the year’s most disarming records3540 6. Colter Wall - Song of the PlainsWall’s songwriting is as stark as it comes: his plain-speaking manner is delivered in a slow, melancholy drawl that paints him as some lonely cowboy – the last man of the West, as he describes in the most matter-of-fact terms how a bullet ripped in to “poor Wild Bill”. There’s no fuss in the instrumentation, either, mostly just gentle picking or brisk, deep thrums on Wall’s acoustic guitar, which are bolstered by icy laps of pedal steel and the occasional harmonica. It’s effective in the simplest of ways – and allows the listener’s imagination to do the restKendrick Lamar co-executive produced the Black Panther soundtrack, has writing credits on its 14 tracks, and appears in various skits and features. But his most essential job on this album is that of the curator, as he brings in a staggering array of talent – from Anderson .Paak, SZA and Future to South African gqom (EDM) artist Babes Wodumo and alt-rapper Yungen Blakrok.Kacey Musgraves third album flips between wide-eyed country pop and disco-electronica. Aided by co-writers and producers Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk – both Nashville stalwarts – Musgraves conjures up a feeling of lightness as she melds the traditional and futuristic.Dirty Computer is Monáe’s gift to the LGBT+ community, non-binary people, black men and women… anyone who faces stigma and abuse just for embracing their true selves. It’s a message of love and hope to anyone who fears what is different, but who has capacity to learn and know better. And it’s seemingly a gift to herself, as well. (RO)Tranquility Base Hotel \u0026amp Casino feels more like an interlude between AM and a seventh Arctic Monkeys album – a delve into the bizarre, where even the Steinway piano has its own character. On “The Ultracheese”, the descending piano chords symbolise a kind of final bow the last soliloquy of the night before the curtain closes. Few bands today are as brave as this.Letissier makes her vintage synths snap, crackle, pop, fizz, freeze, squelch, shimmer and soar. There’s even a shattered glass effect (on “Stranger”) to complete the Old Skool Electronica bingo card. Treble notes bounce from air-cushioned soles. Bass lines lasso your hips. Chiffon layers of Letissier’s Anglo-French vocals glide around your neck and shoulders and roll them back. It’s ridiculously danceable.Thom Yorke’s first ever soundtrack summons the darkness of horror, and the terror of blood and evil, over 25 tracks.Marauder is Interpol’s most experimental to date, blending everything from rough garage rock to Motown rhythms.

Cobalt mining also pollutes local land has been linked to corruption.‘Brutal and rampant’ torture used to crush political dissent in CongoThe four companies said they were using IBM’s blockchain platform to monitor cobalt through entries on a tamper-resistant database from the point that the mineral is extracted.IBM plans to use the pilot, which has been running since December, as a model for the rest of the automotive and consumer electronics industries.Demand for cobalt is expected to increase eightfold by 2026 as the number of cars, laptops, tablets and other devices multiplies.Increasing awareness among consumers of the human rights abuses associated with cobalt mining has put pressure on firms to act.Blockchain, the technology underpinning bitcoin, uses multiple copies of data held on different computers, to create a shared record that is more secure than conventional databases.In the pilot, cobalt from Huayou’s mine will be securely bagged up, with details\u0026nbspentered into IBM’s blockchain, before being sent to LG’s battery plant in South Korea and then arriving at Ford’s factory in the US.The pilot is being overseen by responsible sourcing consultants RCS Global.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Air fares also helped push down the rate, with seasonal prices rising less than they did last year,” said Mike Hardie of the Office for National Statistics (ONS).For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialTransport fuel prices were up 3.4 per cent year-on-year in December, well down from the 12 per cent growth rate in the middle of last year.No-deal Brexit will mean lost jobs and lower wages says BoE governorThe global oil price currently stands at $60.7 a barrel, down from $86 in October.The average price for a litre of unleaded petrol in the UK currently stands at 120p, down from a recent peak of 131p last autumn.However, the ONS also reported on Wednesday that core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, rose to 1.9 per cent in December, up from 1.8 per cent in November.The Bank of England signalled last year that it sees underlying inflationary pressure in the UK economy, despite the uncertainty over Brexit, which is likely to prompt it to increase the cost of borrowing over the next two years.But analysts said the latest prices data suggested there was no need for rapid action.“We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action,” said Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.Inflation spiked to a peak of 3.1 per cent in 2017, mainly due to the record slump in sterling in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum, which pushed up firms’ import costs.Analysts have warned that the pound could plummet again if the UK crashes out of the European Union with no deal in March.Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, warned in November that one of the consequences of a no-deal Brexit will likely be another spike in the cost of living.Separately, the ONS said that UK house price growth was 2.8 per cent in the year to November, up slightly from the 2.7 per cent rate in October, but well down from the 8 per cent growth rates seen before the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That machine could start operation in the late 2050s.\u0026nbspThe concept paper, five years in the making, aimed to explore prospects of tantalizingly more powerful particle colliders that can inaugurate the post-LHC era in high-energy physics, CERN said on its website.Scientists discover new subatomic particle at Large Hadron ColliderUltimately, the FCC would include a superconducting proton accelerator ring with energy of up to 100 tera electron volts, compared with a maximum 17 TeV in the current collider.\u0026nbspCERN Director-General Fabiola Gianotti called the report a remarkable achievement that could help boost understanding of fundamental physics and advance technologies.\u0026nbspCERN said it was not possible to say exactly what benefits the new collider would bring to the world, but pointed out that the discovery of the electron in 1897 led to the electronics industry that now contributes $3 trillion annually to the world economy.The proposal came out of the European strategy for particle physics, which recommended that design and feasibility studies be conducted in order for Europe to be in a position to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project at CERN by the time of the next strategy update.But the decision on whether to go ahead with the FCC - incurring an initial 9 billion euro ($10.25 billion) bill for participating governments plus a later 15 billion euro upgrade - is effectively part of an international race to host the LHC\u0027s successor, with China, Japan, the United States and Europe all interested.Any big machine for the future will be a global machine, said Arnaud Marsollier, head of media relations at CERN.No one expects to have two 100-km colliders built in the next 20 years, so if one is built in China, maybe Europe will do something else.The LHC is expected to keep running until around 2036-2040, by which time it will have done its job collecting data, but it might also be possible to upgrade it by increasing the energy of collisions, which would require major investment.China has floated plans for its own 100-km collider, but has not yet confirmed it will go ahead.Japan is expected to take a decision on a linear collider in March, which could play into a potential choice by European countries in 2020 about whether to back the FCC or another proposal for CERN, the Compact Linear Collider.For physicists, the location may be less important than the science opportunities on offered by a new collider, allowing them to peer into the debris left when subatomic particles smash together and shatter into even smaller pieces, some of which may answer fundamental questions about the universe.But science mega-projects attract talent and can generate unforeseen spin-offs - including the invention of the World Wide Web at CERN, which has become a global centre for physicists, despite the high cost of living around Geneva.The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 earned Peter Higgs and Francois Englert the 2013 Nobel prize. They had predicted half a century earlier that it would one day be discovered.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I find it hilarious. Her interviewees are kind of in on the joke but clearly briefed to take it as seriously as possible. They’ll be mid-flow and she will cock her head and drain all the interest from her face. “What\u0027s the most political thing that\u0027s ever happened?” she asked Robert Peston, who did his best to answer with a straight face. Co-producer Charlie Brooker\u0027s fingerprints are everywhere in the way Morgan\u0027s vain, poorly informed, easily distracted Cunk operates within a ruthlessly satirical production, which sends up the tropes and cliches of every dodgy documentary and history programme. She might not be the comic creation we need, but she is the one we deserve right now. You either love Julia Davis or think her sick filth ought to be banned. Sally4Ever proved yet again that there is nobody working today – or at least nobody with the same platform – with a blacker sense of humour. Sally (Catherine Shepherd) was already surrounded by monsters: her loser of a boyfriend (Alex MacQueen) and tricky colleagues played by Julian Barratt and Felicity Montagu. Then Emma (Davis herself) arrived, a tornado of sex and bad intentions. Beneath the shagging, drugs, excrement, manipulation and malice were pockets of tenderness, but you had to look pretty hard to see them. Luckily there were also gales of laughter. N.b. If you have yet to see it, please do not watch it with your parents or children on Boxing Day and then write in to complain.This was a spiritual successor rather than a sequel to The Night Manager. It was still a Le Carré adaptation on the BBC sprinkled with famous faces, but the differences were as pronounced as the similarities. Park Chan-Wook, the Korean auteur, directed with a high sense of style. Florence Pugh was dazzling as the ingenue actress Charlie, recruited for a dangerous mission across Europe, ably supported by Alexander Skarsgard and Michael Shannon as her spook handlers.

That was the first surprise in this smooth, stylish BBC retelling of the Jeremy Thorpe scandal. He burst convincingly out of the charming fop mould he has slept in so comfortably for thirty years.

The government is still up to a lot of nonsense, but the days of this kind of cover-up, for these reasons, is surely over. Or is it?Edward St Aubyn\u0027s Patrick Melrose novels have the kind of precisely drawn interiority that makes any kind of adaptation seem doomed to fail. Instead, the Sky Atlantic series brought them convincingly to life. It is not a happy tale. In flashback we saw Patrick\u0027s childhood in the shadow of his monstrous father David (Hugo Weaving), and the decades of self-loathing and substance abuse that followed. At the centre of all this was Benedict Cumberbatch, as good as he\u0027s ever been. His Patrick could be brilliant, witty, cruel and pitiful, sometimes in the same smack-addled sentence. Weaving, Jennifer Jason Leigh as David\u0027s wife Eleanor and Pip Torrens as his ghastly friend Nicholas Pratt all put in memorable performances, too. At an age where most of us are long past doing anything, David Attenborough is still changing our expectations of what a nature documentary can do. Like The Rolling Stones, he has been on his farewell tour since about 1970, but unlike Jagger \u0026amp Co, the returns are not diminishing. Is he fuelled by anger at the world\u0027s response to climate change? Or simply driven by some massive internal dynamo, a soul-quest to improve our ability to relate to penguins? Whatever the motivation, Dynasties was wonderful, telling complex stories of the animal kingdom with beautiful photography. It\u0027s unusual for a TV writer to attract more attention than the stars or director. Perhaps the world is changing. Or perhaps it\u0027s simply that the writer of Killing Eve was Phoebe Waller-Bridge, star of Fleabag, Star Wars and one of the country\u0027s outstanding new talents. Here she turned her hand to a spy thriller, an adaptation of Luke Jennings\u0027 novels about a beautiful assassin, Villanelle (Jodie Comer), and the MI6 agent given the task of hunting her down, Eve Polastri (Sandra Oh). Both leads demanded attention: Comer the magnetic murderer, Oh the harassed but brilliant spy. The script swerved between comedy, action and drama often enough to keep everyone guessing.  Yes, the national team have played on television in a World Cup before, but I\u0027m including this because the outcome, an England penalty shoot-out victory, was so unusual as to count as a whole new format. At a time when we all watch things at different times, here was something unmistakably live. We watched Gareth Southgate\u0027s men knowing that the rest of the country was, too, poised in living rooms and pub gardens, ready to bury their heads in a sofa or throw their pints in the air. No other TV programme sold as many waistcoats. The ageing patriarch and his scheming children. Not an original concept. Trust, the drama about the last days of Getty family, proved that it was possible for a series built on this premise to have actors, scenery, direction, script, etc etc, and still somehow fall short. Succession, by comparison, felt alive. If US production values and ambition gave it its scale, its heart was dark and British. We can thank Jesse Armstrong, co-creator of Peep Show, and his all-star line-up of British writers, including the Lucy Prebble, Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett. They made the Roy family expats themselves, and you could hear the old aristocratic froideur in every withering put-down. But we cared for them, too. One of the many TV professionals I consulted for this list thought Succession was so much better than everything else this year that the top 10 should just have it listed in bold and then nine blank spaces.

After winning, she\u0026nbspinvited other party leaders to meet her that evening to discuss a way forward – something Mr Corbyn refused.Details of Labour MPs’ plan to secure a new referendum\u0026nbspcomes as Mr Corbyn prepares to make a speech on his Brexit strategy in Hastings on Thursday, with his party’s actions now thrust into the limelight.Labour’s policy is that once Ms May’s plans have been voted down – as they were by a thumping majority on Tuesday – the party would seek a general election and then consider other options including campaigning for a new referendum.One senior backbencher told The Independent: “Now the motion of no confidence has failed, and we’re not getting an election, our demand is that the Labour leadership must move to back a People’s Vote by the end of the week.“If they go about just putting down motion of no confidence after motion of no confidence, that will make a mockery of our official policy.”They added: “Labour won’t get a People’s Vote unless we make one. If we just wait for Jeremy Corbyn we are never going to do it.”Labour won’t get a People’s Vote unless we make one. If we just wait for Jeremy Corbyn we are never going to do itThe group pointed out that as it stands there are only 37 sitting days left before Brexit, leaving little time to waste.Another Labour MP said: “There will be a motion tabled in the next week or so either from us or from other people with our support. Time is running out and we have to get moving. It’s not certain who or when, but it’s coming soon.”Due to previous decisions by the Commons, Ms May must\u0026nbsptable a motion\u0026nbspon Monday setting out her plans following the defeat of her Brexit withdrawal agreement this week.The motion will be amendable, meaning it will offer the opportunity for MPs to suggest their own ideas and have them voted on. There are likely to be at least four competing amendments put down.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentMr Corbyn will likely table his own, setting out his alternative Brexit vision, and there may also be one from Tory Brexiteers seeking to banish the hated “Irish backstop” from Ms May’s withdrawal agreement.There could be two further motions facilitating a new referendum, which the Labour MPs plan to stand behind. One could directly demand a new vote, while the other, if tabled, would begin to unlock a longer process.Brexit is the mess of all messes, with no clear route outLeaked tapes show Irish government expects to impose hard borderIt would likely be submitted by Conservative ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve, who has masterminded much of the Remain-rebellion on the Tory benches, and would mean that draft laws brought forward by backbenchers would take priority in the schedule over government business – upending the usual practice in the Commons.On Wednesday, Mr Grieve brought forward plans for new legislation that would deliver a second referendum, indicating that they are the draft laws that he and other People’s Vote supporters want to be debated and voted on.Another Labour MP told The Independent: “Some shadow cabinet members do support the idea of a People’s Vote but some are really unhappy with it.“So it feels like to avoid that ision, Jeremy is doubling down on doing everything and anything he possibly can within the remit of Labour’s policy\u0026nbspbefore getting to a new referendum.“The problem is we have to move quickly because of the time limitations, so I think it will take extra pressure from colleagues and members to make it happen.”The Independent has backed calls for a new referendum through its Final Say campaign, with more than 1.1 million people having signed a petition.Earlier this week, backers of a new vote were frustrated when Mr Corbyn’s spokesperson signalled that instead of pivoting to a referendum, the party may first seek repeated votes of no confidence in the government.Liberal Democrats leader Sir Vince Cable also sought to turn up the pressure, tweeting: “Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party cannot procrastinate any longer. Either he backs Brexit or he backs the people.“He has a responsibility to get off the fence and provide some effective opposition.”But a senior figure in Mr Corbyn’s team called on his party colleagues to be patient and argued that some of the discussion over a new referendum is being “manufactured” by those who dislike Mr Corbyn as leader.They said: “People need to wait and see what the leadership says. Moving towards a referendum is our policy as decided at conference, but people are attempting to impart motives for why that hasn’t happened yet that are not there. It’s just that we feel we need to go through various stages which our conference motion set out.“Two weeks ago people said we wouldn’t go for a no confidence motion because we were afraid, but we did. The next stage is how do we amend the motion on Monday.”He added: “At the end of the day we don’t have a majority and I don’t believe for one second there will be a People’s Vote at this stage because there is no majority, even if we were to put a three line whip on it. I think a lot of this is being manufactured, people putting down amendments now to whip things up because they don’t like Jeremy’s leadership.”Mr Corbyn will give a speech on Thursday which should flesh out his proposed view of how the country moves forward, but insiders steered The Independent away from the idea that he would back a new referendum.Ms May survived an attempt on Wednesday to oust her as prime minister, as MPs rejected Jeremy Corbyn’s motion of no confidence in the government by a margin of 325 to 306.Her 19-vote victory came less than 24 hours after the crushing defeat of her EU Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons, and clears the way for her to start cross-party talks on a Brexit plan B.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ll tell the Prime Minister loud and clear that she must urgently rule out the threat of a no-deal Brexit and I\u0027ll make the case for the public to have a say on what happens next.I want to use this meeting to open up the debate about our shared future to the whole country - not restrict it to the corridors of Westminster - so I’ll also urge her to consider the role a Citizens’ Assembly might play as a complement to a People\u0027s Vote.A quick reminder of where we are:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Theresa May\u0027s Brexit withdrawal agreement was voted down on Tuesday, in the biggest defeat in Commons history.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- Jeremy Corbyn tabled a motion of no confidence in the prime minister, which Ms May won last night by a margin of 19 votes.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp- The prime minister will now be meeting with politicians from all over the political spectrum as she works on an alternative plan for Brexit.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s coverage of the day\u0027s political events.Please allow a moment for the liveblog to load“Before there can be any positive discussions about the way forward, the government must remove clearly once and for all the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit from the EU and all the chaos that would come as a result of that,” Mr Corbyn said.\u0026nbspMs May said she was disappointed that Mr Corbyn had so far refused to meet her but said her door remains open.\u0026nbspThe Labour leader will be giving a speech in Hastings this morning and is likely to face a barrage of questions about his decision while the prime minister will now hold talks with the DUP and the eurosceptics in her own party.Ms May must\u0026nbsppresent her alternative\u0026nbspplan to the House of Commons early next week.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May speaking during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the House of Commons the day after her Brexit deal was defeated in ParliamentPolice monitor Brexit protesters outside the houses of parliament in London.

Both say they want to avoid a border in order to comply with the Good Friday Agreement, however.In a private conversation caught on tape Tánaiste Simon Coveney told a fellow minister there would be checks in the event of a no-deal “but we can\u0027t get into where they\u0027ll be at this stage”.May \u0027won\u0027t talk Brexit with Corbyn\u0027 despite vow to contact senior MPs“But once you start talking about checks anywhere near the Border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we\u0027ll be the Government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland,” he said.Micheál Martin, the leader of main opposition party Fianna Fáil, told the country’s parliament after the recording came to light that there was now “a private understanding” behind the scenes that border checks were increasingly likely.\u0026nbsp“It seems there is a private understanding and knowledge of a border in the aftermath of a no-deal Brexit but at all costs that private understanding must not be shared with the public,” he said.On Wednesday afternoon Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar denied his government has secret plans to impose a border.“We are not planning for checks on the land border in Northern Ireland,” he said, adding that Mr Coveney had been misinterpreted.“We had a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. I remember it well during the Troubles and before the single market in 1993,” the Taoiseach said.\u0026nbsp“I remember going there as a teenager. I remember the customs checks, I remember the 24-hour rule, I remember seeing soldiers, and I never want to see any of that ever again.”Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by Parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people\u0027s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of ParliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outiside ParliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside ParliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster Bridge ahead of today\u0027s vote Protesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside ParliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near ParliamentBut pushed on how a border could actually be avoided, Mr Varadkar said the question was one for Brexiteers.\u0026nbspTheresa May\u0027s Brexit deal was rejected in the House of Commons on Tuesday night, with MPs objecting mostly to the Northern Ireland backstop drawn up by negotiatiors to avoid a hard border rememerging.

That means that\u0026nbspif the UK is to hold another referendum, it will have to apply to extend the Article 50 deadline.\u0026nbspBut why does it take so long to hold a new referendum? Why did the Constitution Unit at UCL estimate that it would take six months? Surely the process could be speeded up in what is, after all, a national emergency?\u0026nbspThe short answer is that a lot of rules for the conduct of referendums were invented for the 2011 referendum on the voting system and for the 2016 EU referendum – the first national referendums since the 1975 vote to join the European Economic Community.Many of these rules are about allowing time for the independent Electoral Commission to consult people about the wording of the question, for parliament to scrutinise the legislation for the referendum, and finally for the referendum campaign itself.\u0026nbspBrexit humiliation is stark reminder of Britain’s waning influenceOf course it would be possible to shorten all the\u0026nbspperiods in which these things had to be done. After all, the Greeks managed to hold a referendum on the EU bailout in 2015 in just eight days. What was striking was how little controversy there was about that vote, even after the Greek government later accepted a bailout deal which in many respects was worse than the one rejected in the referendum.Compare that with the continuous dispute about the 2016 UK referendum, supposedly conducted to the highest possible democratic standards.\u0026nbspThe real problem, however, is that a new referendum in the UK today is a controversial idea and it would be hard to get the legislation needed to hold it through a hung parliament.\u0026nbspNormally, legislation has to be proposed by the government. It may be possible to force Theresa May into proposing a referendum, if the House of Commons voted for it\u0026nbspbut if the prime minister refused to do so, it might even be possible for parliament to change the\u0026nbsprules to allow a committee of MPs to propose a bill for a referendum.That is what lies behind recent headlines about the House of Commons “taking back control” of the parliamentary agenda from the government.\u0026nbspBut even if a bill for a referendum could be introduced, it would take time to get it through parliament because it would be so controversial. There would be arguments about the wording of the question, and every aspect of the rules. In a House of Commons where no party has a majority it would be hard to control the timetable.And that is before the bill even goes to the House of Lords, where the timetable is even more difficult to control, especially for legislation that was not contained in the governing party’s manifesto.\u0026nbspThat is the why it would be impossible to pass the bill before 29 March and why proponents of a second referendum will be looking for a postponement of the Brexit deadline.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

An exclusive survey for The Independent shows that a fresh vote received more support than any of the\u0026nbspfour other options put to the public, including allowing\u0026nbspthe prime minister to go back to Brussels\u0026nbspor a\u0026nbspno-deal Brexit.The survey by poling organisation BMG Research also suggests that more people oppose\u0026nbspMs May’s deal than back it, although the prime minister can take some comfort in the data showing a softening of opposition.

It found 28 per cent were against and 26 per cent did not know.Remaining in the EU was backed by 45 per cent, while 39 per cent of people said they\u0026nbspopposed reversing Brexit and 16 per cent said they did not know.Forty-five per cent supported further negotiation with the EU, while 34 per cent were against going back to Brussels for fresh talks. More than a fifth (21 per cent) did not know.Some 40 per cent would opt for Norway-style deal – which allows access to the single market – but 36 per cent dismissed the option and 24 per cent were unsure.Leaving the EU without a deal was the least popular option as it was preferred by only 35 per cent, while 45 per cent opposed it and 21 per cent said they did not know.It comes as\u0026nbspthe prime minister has been reaching out to Labour MPs and trade unions in a last-ditch bid to get her deal\u0026nbspthrough parliament.Government insiders are expecting Brussels\u0026nbspto offer\u0026nbspMs May some extra help by Monday, which they hope will ease fears from wavering MPs over\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspIrish backstop.However, she is unlikely to secure a legally binding guarantee that the UK can independently decide to the leave the backstop, which Brexiteers and her\u0026nbspDUP allies want.BBC analysis estimates Ms May could lose the meaningful vote by\u0026nbsp228 votes next week, after which she would have to come back to parliament within three days with a plan B.Northern Ireland secretary ‘using peace process as bargaining tool’What is the position of the big trade unions on Brexit?The truth about May’s shambolic approach to the unionsFinally, May has realised she desperately needs Labour’s backingArticle 50 set to be extended even if May wins crucial Brexit voteOpposition to Ms May’s deal\u0026nbsphas weakened among the public, as the BMG research shows 37 per cent think\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspshould reject the deal, compared with 43 per cent in December.When asked if parliament should vote to accept the terms of the deal, 29 per cent said they should, up from 26 per cent last month. More than 30 per cent said they were unsure in both instances.The poll put Labour and the Conservatives\u0026nbspneck and neck on 36 per cent of the vote,\u0026nbspwith the\u0026nbspLiberal Democrats on 12 points,\u0026nbspUkip\u0026nbspon 6 per cent and the Greens on 5 points, once don’t-knows were excluded.The Independent\u0026nbsprevealed on Friday that Ms May’s\u0026nbspchances of delivering\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspon 29 March are fading fast after senior ministers privately admitted more time is needed, even if her deal wins the backing of parliament.On Saturday, transport secretary Chris Grayling was accused of engaging in “gutter politics” when he warned that blocking Brexit could lead to a surge in far-right extremism.Created with Sketch.

Failing this, a general election will be called.The last time a motion of no confidence successfully received the required support of MPs was in 1979 - by just one vote. After the motion passed - defeating Jim Callaghan’s minority Labour government - MargaretThatcher emerged victorious in the resulting election, with a clear majority.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa May speaking during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions in the House of Commons the day after her Brexit deal was defeated in ParliamentPolice monitor Brexit protesters outside the houses of parliament in London.

Despite the fact that inflation fell to a two-year low of 2.1 per cent in December, this is much higher than the Bank of England’s base interest rate of 0.75 per cent. Most banks fail to match the central bank’s rate with their easy access savings accounts, which offered an average of 0.23 per cent in 2018, according to figures compiled by Gatehouse Bank.The research shows that savers relying on easy access accounts would have suffered a real terms loss of £19 on deposits of £1,000, £37 on savings of £2,000, £94 on a lump sum of £5,000 and £468 on £25,000.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialBased on an average nest egg of £26,403, using the most recent figures from Sun Life, inflation would have led to a loss of £494. Charles Haresnape, CEO of Gatehouse Bank, said: “Savings rates are slowly creeping up but inflation is still taking a huge bite out of savings held in easy access accounts. Millions of savers will undoubtedly have found that in 2018 they received a substantial negative ‘real’ return on their hard-earned savings, when the impact of inflation is taken in to account. UK inflation hits two-year low as petrol prices fallWhich banks have passed on the interest rate increase to customers?Rising interest rates will not yet lead to another financial crashSavers keeping their money in cash would have lost out to an greater degree - the average nest egg would have lost £554.\u0026nbsp“Those looking to drive a real increase in their savings need to be on the front foot in looking for better returns to prevent their nest eggs from shrinking. Many instant access savings rates are still at rock bottom and no one can afford to leave a significant amount of cash lying around for inflation to swoop on.“There are many more accounts savers should consider, from fixed-term to notice accounts, which offer greater returns and won’t leave them as vulnerable to the impact of inflation, like easy access rates.” \u0026nbspMeanwhile, savers were dealt a double blow as analysts said the latest inflation data indicated the BoE could take its time over raising interest rates. Meanwhile, Howard Archer of the EY Item Club said: “We would not rule out two interest rate hikes in 2019 but we believe one is more likely as significant uncertainties persist – with expected lower inflation easing pressure for more aggressive Bank of England action.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So we basically try to put them into the system so they can get a proper welcome.”\u0026nbspThe solution is temporary and this is why we held this protest. We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.The squat was one way in which they have tried to help newly arrived asylum seekers and refugees.\u0026nbspUntil two months ago, Barcelona’s “marginalised people” occupied the building, Maria says, but vacated it so asylum seekers could make use of it instead.\u0026nbspBut while the squat eviction has been temporarily suspended, the prospect\u0026nbsphas not been permanently banished. At a protest following the celebratory lunch, several hundred activists highlighted the limbo the squat’s residents now find themselves in.\u0026nbsp“For now, we are happy the eviction has been stopped, but we don´t know where they will go so we demand a permanent solution,” Maria added.“What can you do in the absence of state help?

We want the government to provide a proper hosting system for refugees with permanent housing, education, and work opportunities.\u0026nbsp“It’s stupid to have people living here without these means because they will continue to stay anyway, so why not give them the chance to pay taxes and contribute to the economy?”Zac\u0026nbspleft Gambia in 2015, fearing for his life due to conflict between different political factions. He initially sought asylum in Germany, which was “not so friendly,” so came to Barcelona two months ago after hearing it was more welcoming to refugees. He has lived at Casa Africa since.\u0026nbsp“Since I´ve been in Barcelona, I have seen a lot of friendly, nice and very welcoming people,” he said.\u0026nbspHousing for asylum seekers is abysmal – things need to change now“Many of them are also struggling and it´s not easy for them to help, so we really thank them a lot.“It is also not an easy life to be a refugee and I have met many people sleeping on the street. I was told that if I see someone in trouble like this, to bring them here. I have brought maybe four or five people here, to the squat at Casa Africa.”Zac said he was granted asylum seeker status a week ago but still does not have access to a social worker, which he needs in order to find accommodation, and a job.“My dream is to find work. If I don´t have a home, I cannot achieve this, but hopefully this will change.”Ignasi Calbó, manager of the city council’s “Barcelona, Refugee City” plan\u0026nbsp(Barcelona – Cuitat Refugi) said all asylum seekers at Casa Africa are enrolled onto language courses and have access to legal advice.\u0026nbspHe said the plan’s “Service Centre for Immigrants, Emigrants and Refugees”\u0026nbsp(SAIER)\u0026nbspwas launched in 2015 in response to the crisis. Its website states refugees and immigrants are provided with information on housing, legal aid, social care and on learning Catalan and Spanish.\u0026nbspMexico agrees to take in America’s asylum seekersBut Mr Calbó bemoaned the lack of central government support, which, he says, “creates unrealistic policies, provides no resources to help refugees and simply does not care for them.”He said the council is appreciative of the work of Barcelona’s community of activists for helping newly arrived refugees.\u0026nbsp“It’s good to see how people are working to help people who need it, but we are working with the community to find solutions,” he added.“They help us and we help them to achieve their goals, like we have done with postponing of this eviction.”He confirmed Casa Africa was not an isolated case of solidarity shown by locals to newcomers.\u0026nbspMr Calbó said some 7,000 refugees arrived in the city in 2018, up from around 4,000 in 2017 and nearer 2,000 in 2016.But he said programmes to integrate and host refugees are expensive.Those who have found shelter at Casa Africa must wait to hear whether they will be allowed to stay.However, for Zac, it has already proved\u0026nbsphow migrants need not be regarded with fear and suspicion, and can help benefit their adopted communities.“There is plenty of room for everyone,” he said. “People are just not given access to go and work and pay taxes. If they are given this, everything will be comfortable.\u0026nbsp“If you are working you must pay your taxes and that is what we want to do.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last year, Facebook removed the group\u0027s page as well as those of its leaders, and similarly said that the accounts were being used to spread hate.A spokesperson for Facebook said at the time that it did not remove pages “just because some people don’t like them” and allowed controversial political opinions.“But political views can and should be expressed without hate,” a statement added.“There are times though when legitimate political speech crosses the line and becomes hate speech designed to stir up hatred against groups in our society.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Few believe him.Last year, he enraged EU chiefs, grabbing a key role as the European Commission’s Secretary-General by stealth and seizing control of the entire Brussels machine and its , staff.This puts him in pole position to succeed his boss, Jean-Claude Juncker who lurches into retirement this year as the commission’s supreme leader.Mrs May, steely-eyed and unflinching at home, has been the first to blink whenever the EU has set out its demands.Now she has infuriated fellow Tories by flirting with opportunistic Labour MPs and offering concessions to trade union dinosaurs such as Len McCluskey.“Her first loyalty has always been to the Conservative Party,” says a former ally.“Yet here she is presiding over its potential destruction.”The rebellion, led by Tory hypocrite Dominic Grieve, will reach its climax as Tory Remainers gang up with Labour and unSpeakable John Bercow to sabotage Brexit and block No Deal.A “secret” plan to hijack Commons procedure is being hatched by ex-minister Oliver Letwin, perhaps the silliest clever person in Westminster.It was Letwin who devised the disastrous poll tax, invited thieves into his house at am to “use his loo” and loot his property and casually dumped secret Cabinet papers in a Hyde Park litter bin.And it was Letwin, “the man in the custard-coloured corduroys”, who drove a stake through free speech in a am stitch-up with Labour and the Lib-Dems.Tory Chief Whip Julian Smith overheard the plotting in an MPs’ cloakroom, perhaps after being alerted by Letwin’s yelping giggle.He swtly leaked the scheme to frighten waverers into saving May’s deal.The rebel rabble have no idea what will happenthey succeed in killing it.A second referendum giving a clear choice between In and Out might well see an increased vote for Brexit.Any attempt to fiddle the question would trigger a dangerous backlash.An emergency election is for the birds. That leaves us with a No Deal Brexit on World Trade terms, which cannot be stopped without a change in the law before March .Forget about the Government’s Apocalypse Now propaganda. Germany is near recession, Italy is already there and France is joining the queue.Our economy is growing better than most and experts say it will accelerate, whichever way Brexit is resolved.For that silent -per-cent majority, a clean break still seems the right answer.SHOUTY Remainer Anna Soubry rightly complains about being labelled a “Nazi” by unsavoury protesters.Yet this publicity-hungry Tory MP is very free with her own insults, casually labelling as “racist” anyone who voted Out – surely a far nastier insult in modern Britain.Perhaps Ms Soubry should follow her own revolting advice . . . and “just suck it up”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Maybe it will come after her defeat.TORY liar Dominic Grieve is setting fire to our Parliament and democracy.Here is a man who promised voters in  that the referendum verdict “must be respected” and any fears that Parliament would thwart it “were entirely misplaced”. He meant none of it.Parliament is not only plotting to thwart Brexit, Grieve is behind it.Always a rabid Remainer, he is the architect of a sickening ruse to strip the Government of power and halt Brexit.It is an act of naked contempt for .million ordinary people. An attempt by a sneering elite to nully their decision so the “right people” can get their way.They are saying: democracy is worthless.

Even worse, it would deny us the right to walk away from these new arrangements without the EU’s say-so.May’s dodgy deal would reduce the UK to a vassal state, a bossed-about colonial outpost of the Brussels ­oligarchy. The people voted for Leave, yet May offers us Remain by another name, a deal that sells out Brexit.For the PM to so wilfully ignore the cry of her people is a sucker-punch to the most basic principles of democracy.But it gets worse. The MPs who plan to revolt against May’s deal in the ­Commons today will not do so to protect Brexit.They are not taking a stand against May’s deal to defend what .million of us — the largest bloc in British ­electoral history — voted for in June : A clean exit from the EU.No. They see taking down May’s deal as the first step to taking down Brexit itself.Whether it’s Europhile Tories or Labour, SNP and Lib Dem MPs who have long loathed the idea of Brexit, an army of parliamentarians plan to knock down May’s deal so they can set about knocking down Brexit.So the real ide in ­Parliament today is over how to stop Brexit.The main thing our MPs will disagree on today is whether Brexit should be killed off by May’s shady deal, by extending the Article  process or even with a second referendum, as anti-May MPs would prefer.Think about this. Think about what it says about the state of British politics.The people vote in historic numbers to leave the EU. Yet the political class plot and conspire to make sure we do not.It is hard to think of another time in living memory when politicians have been so ­spectacularly out of touch with public sentiment — and so ­sinisterly cavalier about overriding our democratic wishes.There are honourable exceptions, of course. From Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Tory camp to Kate Hoey on the Labour benches, some MPs will opposeMay’s deal precisely because they believe in Brexit and plan to carry on fighting for it.But a majority of MPs fall into one of the two Brexit-phobic camps — whether it’s May’s “Remain by another name” or those who would stop Brexit entirely.Some MPs are terryingly upfront about their distaste for the democratic process and their disgust with us, the pesky ­electorate.In an unhinged online rant, Labour MP Clive Lewis branded Brexit a “racist endeavour” and said “we need to end it, now”. Let’s be real about what this means.Ending Brexit means overturning the largest vote in British history. It means ending the right of ordinary people to have a say in Britain’s future. When MPs like Lewis scream, “Stop Brexit!”, they are really saying: “Stop democracy!”Labour’s David Lammy is also open about his desire to overthrow the largest act of democracy in our history.He described the vote for Brexit as “madness” and says MPs must “bring this nightmare to an end”. By “this nightmare”, he means the ­public’s reasoned, ­democratic request to leave the EU.This is the depth of the ­contempt some MPs now feel for ordinary people. They see our political beliefs as a “nightmare”.On the Tory side, people such as Anna Soubry have not been shy about their hatred for Brexit. On Sunday Ms Soubry posted a chilling message on Twitter.She said Parliament has “historic” business to take care of this week and reminded everyone that under Section  of the Public Order Act, it is an “arrestable offencea person uses ­threatening or abusive words”.In essence, she is warning the masses to stay away from Parliament, to not even think about protesting.It is testament to the arrogance of the political elite that they can openly call for the overthrow of Brexit and warn the little people they might be arrestedthey get too angry about this blatant assault on our democratic rights.“Know your place, plebs.” That is what they are saying.The extent to which Parliament is ­conspiring against the people can be seen in Speaker John Bercow’s ripping-up of parliamentary rules.Last week, Bercow let MPs vote on an amendment to a motion put ­forward by Tory arch-Remainer Dominic Grieve.The amendment, voted through by  MPs to , would force the ­Government to come up with a Plan B within three daysMay’s deal is defeated in the Commons.It should be noted here that Grieve has changed his tune.In his election message to constituents in May  he declared: “The decision of the electorate in the referendum must be respected and that I should support a ­reasoned process to give effect to it.”Now he is saying it is “the biggest ­mistake of our recent history”.As one commentator astutely put it ­yesterday: “It’s precisely this sort of ­sophistry that ­created the backlash that led to Brexit in the first place.”The BBC has stated that Grieve’s ­amendment means MPs who are “plotting” against Brexit would have “more space in which to work”. Thanks to Bercow’s unprecedented move, backbenchers will have much greater ­leeway to hamper and even kill off Brexit.It is believed anti-Brexit backbenchers are planning to table an amendment that would give their motions priority over Government motions.This would not just dramatically change how Parliament has always operated — it would let backbenchers scupper a No Deal Brexit, perhaps even force through a second ­referendum.Some are referring to this as a coup — an attempt by certain MPs to take back control from the Government and also from us, the public.As one senior Government figure said: “This could be ‘game over’ for Brexit.”Democracy is hanging by a thread in this country.Last year, MPs celebrated the th anniversary of women and working-class men getting the vote. This year, they are using their clout to overthrow ­something millions voted for.The hypocrisy is staggering.In today’s battle between MPs who back May’s Brexit betrayal and MPs who want to go even further in ending the “nightmare” of Brexit, there will be one clear loser . . . democracy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To allow Brussels,it wanted, to keep us bound hand and foot forever in the Irish backstop, unable to forge our own independent trading policy.It would rapidly have become clear to the Leave majority that their decision, while nominally honoured, had been sold down the river. That we had not truly left the EU and maybe never would.More practically it all but guaranteed the collapse of the minority Tory Government since,it had somehow passed, the DUP would have withdrawn their support.The Government was always going to lose heavily. The discredited Commons speaker John Bercow ensured it by refusing to select any amendments to the Bill that might have helped narrow the margin of defeat.It was another low for a man who has already brought disgrace to his historic office by abusing his powers to help engineer the destruction of Brexit. Parliament will be a better place without him.But let’s not pretend it would have made much dference. The deal was fatally flawed.Mrs May’s response to the vote last night was feisty — challenging Parliament to find a viable alternative that could win a majority and honour the ­referendum. No one has a clue what that would be.And her call for MPs to “listen to the British people” was dead right.Outside Westminster, the public just wants Brexit done. They are aghast at the political games.The Sun reluctantly believes we must head for a clean break, finalise preparations as best we can and batten down the hatches.We never wanted a No Deal. It would mean a tough and probably damaging few months. But it would be the only solution left which defends what should now be paramount and most precious to us all: Our democracy — and the public’s faith in it.None of the alternatives does that.  They neither honour the referendum, nor are possible to sustain.They are all damaging in their own way. Yet our Remainer-dominated Parliament will fight tooth and nail to secure one of them and thwart a clean break, in direct conflict with millions of voters.The Norway-Plus proposal, however its champions spin it, is EU membership without the voting rights. No independent trade ­policy. No end to free movement.It is a short-term Remainers’ Brexit which would lead to only one ­conclusion: A new and irresistible clamour to exit properly.Another Tory idea is to lure Labour support by offering the permanent customs union they want with the EU, abandoning all thoughts of independent trade. It is a potentially suicidal idea which could destroy their Party and put Corbyn’s Marxists in power.Then there’s the toxic second referendum which would upend our democracy, shatter trust in politicians for all time and burst fully open our national isions.Its only upside is that Leave would probably win again. Plenty of the more sensible Remainers have seen through the EU now — and dislike the blatant unfairness of overriding a democratic mandate before it has been enacted.But what would the question be  Remain versus a deal already now rejected by a monstrous Commons majority as bad for Britain And whatRemain DID win  It is staggeringly naive to imagine that would settle it. Why should Leavers accept it  The wounds would never heal.Labour appears almost ready now to buckle to its europhile members and back that second vote — and its betrayal of millions of left-leaning Leave voters will finally be complete.Shadow Cabinet ministers are already teeing it up, laughably attempting to deflect blame by claiming Tory failure gives them no option. Don’t believe a word.The Tories have dedicated nearly three years trying to see Brexit through while Labour have tried to thwart every effort and their Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer has secretly lobbied relentlessly for a ​new referendum. Labour will own every ounce of the betrayal their working-class voters will feel — and will richly deserve the ballot box backlash.Mrs May has had the hardest task of any Prime Minister since Winston Churchill, trying to fulfil the Brexit mandate with no majority in a Parliament stuffed with Remainers, some colluding with the EU to sabotage her position.Even so, her handling of it has been a woeful failure.She is clinging to power by her fingernails.

Disgracefully, this attempt is being led by the Gloomster of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.This is just another version of ’s Project Fear that was launched by the Treasury to try to persuade us against voting for Brexit by prophesying disasterwe did. Some prophecy that turned out to be! Project Fear Mark II is just as ridiculous.That said, Brexit has always been primarily about politics, rather than economics. The strongest argument for it is quite simply that we should be free to make our own decisions. But there is a connection with economics, because freedom includes being able to make decisions about economic matters.Moreover,people could be persuaded that re-establishing self-government for our country would carry a heavy cost that would hit them in the pocket, many might be dissuaded from supporting it.But it would NOT carry a heavy cost. Quite the opposite. It would bring large gains.Listening to the Remainers who dominate the BBC’s coverage, you might easily believe that the EU is a raging economic success. It isn’t. Yes, it was a relative success when we joined it in . But over recent decades the EU’s relative economic performance has been poor.The reason is clear: The EU makes bad decisions, including about economic matters, because its institutions don’t work very well and it is pursuing a political project, namely the establishment of a federal state. In the process, it is pushing barmy policies of harmonisation and integration and it engages in excessive regulation. The euro is the worst of the EU’s blunders — so far. But you can be sure that there will be more.Nowhere  are countries pursuing anything like the EU’s mad agenda — no single markets, no monetary unions and no federal super-states. Unlike so many members of our elite, other countries’ leaders have noticed that the EU doesn’t work.So why are so many clever and decent people among our leaders apparently still keen that Britain should stay in the EU  There are two reasons. First, many of them simply don’t know the facts about economic performance and don’t understand economics anyway.People with little experience of business who are steeped in the world of politics or the civil service naturally tend to assume that prosperity flows from the pens of those who sign agreements. People like them. But it doesn’t. It derives quite simply from the efforts of millions of men and women and of the businesses that employ them.Yes, trade deals can be good, but you do not need them in order to trade. Currently we do not have a trade deal with the United States. Yet the US is our biggest single trading partner. Go figure!Second, many among our governing elite do not like nation states. And they particularly don’t like ours. By contrast, they have a touching faith in the EU’s ability to suppress the uglier sides of nationalism while keeping the peace and pursuing an agenda of good government for all. Doubtless they also believe in Father Christmas.If we leave the EU in March without signing a deal, we would not be “crashing out” or “falling off a clf”. Nor would it be accurate to describe this as a “hard” Brexit.Rather, it would be a clean Brexit, a full Brexit, a true Brexit, in contrast to the half-baked non-Brexit proposed by Mrs May.Mrs May’s “deal” was the Remainers’ Revenge. You only had to look at the expression on the face of Jean-Claude Juncker to know what had happened.The EU got everything while we got nothing. And we were due to pay £billion for the privilege.Now that Mrs May’s capitulation of a “deal” has been consigned to the knackers yard, we should devote our energies to preparing to leave in March without any such deal. I am not suggesting that a No- Deal Brexit would be roses all the way. There would be some immediate dislocation that would carry some costs. But they would be relatively minor and short-lived. And it would be wrong to mistake such short-term minor disruption for the eventual destination.Just like umpteen other countries around the world, we can thrive outside the EU — without anything like Mrs May’s deal.Within a few years I am sure we would look back and wonder how anyone could have thought otherwise.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Uncertainty is continuing — but we are prepared.”Meanwhile Irish premier Leo Varadkar said he would rather see a No Deal than accept a time limit on the backstop designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland.Just hours earlier Eurotunnel announced it was taking steps to ensure a No Deal would have “minimal” effect. It said: “We have adapted our infrastructure so that, with or without a deal, traffic flow through will be maintained.”And last week the chief of Calais insisted a No Deal would not mean extra checks for hauliers.Jean Marc Puissesseau said: “We have heard so many things about a hard Brexit. We have been preparing for a No Deal for a year. Brexiteers immediately leapt on the statements.Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover, said: “The merchants of Project Fear tell us there will be chaos at Dover and lorries backing up all through Kent. Yet the port of Calais have said there won’t be any holds up on their side, now the Port of Dover says they too are ready to leave the EU.”Colleague Marie Trevelyan told The Sun: “It’s fantastic to hear the confident voices of our critical businesses — Dover, Calais, Eurotunnel — confirming they are ready for Brexit.Arch Eurosceptic Jacob Rees Mogg added: “Project Fear is disappearing into the mists of time.”Researchers at Imperial College last year warned they believed extra checks at Dover could lead to a dramatic increase in congestion on motorways, with tailbacks of up to  miles as well as local congestion.Dover yesterday admitted “external factors such as border controls could slow things down”. But Mr Bannister said such delays would happen at “every EU-facing gateway” across the UK.He stepped up demands for Theresa May’s Government to do all it could to help industries that rely on the port moving goods worth billions each year between the UK and Europe. But he insisted no other port had such experience of dealing with disruption.He said: “Within a few days of the last signicant incident of Operation Stack in the infamous summer of , Dover was once again handling record volumes.”Meanwhile Brexiteers said they wanted the Government to increase pressure on Ireland to admit there would not be any threat to the soft border separating the North from the Republic in a No Deal.Mr Varadkar made it clear in talks with Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron that he preferred No Deal to limiting the backstop as he would prefer to blame the UK for any chaos than suffer domestic humiliation.But his stance was undermined as his deputy Simon Coveney was caught conceding No Deal would still require border checks too. In a taped conversation with transport minister Shane Ross, he said Dublin must not publicly admit that will be the case for fear of a public backlash.Sterling jumped . per cent against the euro — its strongest rally in  months.Later in the day it dipped to €..It rose . per cent against the dollar, to ., before falling to .. The FTSE  index of blue chip companies experienced a choppy session yesterday in the wake of Tuesday’s vote.It closed just . pointsdown at ,..Mr Carney told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee “the market is waiting”, adding that he expected continued volatility.Carney said the rebound in Sterling reflected market sentiment that the chances of No Deal had waned.Financial markets believe Brexit could be delayed, he added.The EU Commission yesterday conceded that it is relying on getting a deal past British MPs to avoid such a scenario. The recording, published by the Irish Independent, will embarrass Mr Coveney and heap further pressure on his government to compromise.He had been speaking at the end of a press briefing, at which he had just minutes earlier insisted: “We are not planning to put checks on the border.” But when asked about the possibility of controls on goods he replied: “Yes, but we can’t get into where they’ll be at this stage”.He added: “Once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.”Mr Coveney suggested new checks between the UK and Ireland could largely take place at sea to reduce the need for border infrastructure. His remarks came after No  sources said Mr Varadkar fears being toppledhe gives ground on the border.Speaking in Dublin later, Mr Varadkar insisted the ball was firmly in Britain’s court. Referring to the Commons defeat of Mrs May’s EU deal, he said: “That solution has now been rejected by Westminster — the problem now lies there.“The onus is on Westminster to come up with solutions that they can support, but they must be solutions that the EU and Ireland can accept. We have always said thatthe UK were to evolve from its red lines on the Customs Union and the Single Market, that the European position would evolve also.”Asked what plans it has in place to avoid a hard border, a Commission spokesman said: “We have a deal on the table andthis deal is ratied nothing of this sort will happen.“What you are describing is a situation that would result from a No Deal exit, which we may be closer to but it’s not yet certain.

But she added: “Our door remains open”.Tory MP James Heappey blasted: Jeremy Corbyn has sat down with terrorists around the world apparently in pursuit of peace and always without preconditions.But will he sit down with the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to tackle biggest constitutional challenge of our time without preconditions  Errr, no.Mrs May revealed she would be meeting MPs representing the “widest possible range of views” later on Thursday.BBC had to switch live coverage of the speech to BBC – because the FA Cup replay between Southampton and Derby went into extra time.But Tory Brexiteers feared she is ready to delay Brexit to pursue a softer deal with the EU after No refused to rule out accepting a customs union to win opposition support.Also, with just  days to go until Brexit and the clock ticking down fast:Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood slammed Mr Corbyn for refusing to enter talks with Mrs May — given he has previously met Hamas and said that the West should speak to Syrian dictator President Assad.He stormed: “How incredible he’s willing to sit down with terrorist groups but not willing to discuss matters of national importance with the Prime Minister.”After meeting Mrs May, Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: “No Deal must be taken off the table and there has to be constructive discussion of People’s Vote.“We are willing to listen but just fiddling with the agreement is not sufficient.”The SNP confirmed they had also ruled out joining in any formal talks unless the PM drops the No Deal threat.Westminster leader Ian Blackford also demanded an extension of the Article  process plus the option of a second referendum.In a letter to the PM he confirmed: “Discussions around cosmetic changes to your deal, which has now been rejected by Parliament will not move this matter forward.“It is my view thatyou are able to confirm that the extension of Article , a ruling out of a No Deal Brexit and the option of a second EU referendum would form the basis of those discussions, then we could participate in them.”The SNP have welcomed the chats.NEXT FEW DAYS: More meetings with senior parliamentarians to forge a cross party consensus on BrexitJean-Claude Juncker has said he will host the PM in Brusselsshe really wants to come - but she hasn’t responded yet.MONDAY: The PM will make a statement in the Commons laying out her next steps, which will be debated and voted upon by MPs by January  at the latest - but probably earlier.MARCH : Britain’s still set to leave the EU by this date - unless everything  goes wrong.In a further headache for the PM, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox signalled that he would quitshe locked Britain into a customs union.Leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg warned there were “considerable risks” of the Conservative party splittingMrs May got her Brexit deal through the Commons on the back of Labour votes.For show, three successive Leavers were made Brexit Secretary, then sidelined. Two quit in protest.Remain ultras working for a billionaire Remainer’s campaign to rerun the referendum openly conspired with the EU to destroy our negotiating position.Remainer politicians, campaigners and journalists outnumbered Brexiters four to one on virtually all TV news shows, heaping bile on Brexit.And Mrs May’s deal would still have lost on Tuesday evenevery single Leaver had backed it — because a Tory Remainer hardcore prefer the horric chaos of a second referendum.Leave MPs aren’t the “hardliners” in this battle, unless it is hardline to fulfil a democratic mandate as promised.This fiasco is not of their making. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m talking about the footage of Anna Soubry being harassed and bullied in the street which has led to a man being arrested.Who would have thought we would live somewhere where people think it’s OK to aggressively call an MP a “slag” and a “Nazi” to her face — simply because she has a view that they don’t agree with.When it comes to political harassment outside Parliament, some people have suggested that women are disproportionately being targeted. I’m not sure that’s true.Journalist Owen Jones was also followed down the street in an equally bullying way.And not so long ago, Jacob Rees-Mogg was verbally attacked on his own doorstep in front of his children.The sad truth is that there is a nasty taste about politics in everyone’s mouth at the moment.And this kind of behaviour isn’t a million miles away from the way that politicians treat each other in the chamber.PMQs has become a ludicrous, abusive, screaming match full of insults and contempt. Sometimes it’s worse than that and the confrontation is pre-meditated.Not so long ago, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell called for Tory MPs “not to be able to show their faces in public” without being challenged by “direct action”.Since he said it, the atmosphere both inside and outside Parliament has become considerably more feverish. But the point is that some people take their lead from the way politicians treat each other.Politics should be all about serving people before you serve yourself.And there was a time when we trusted our politicians to do the right thing for the right reasons.But that trust is gone.In fact, people are becoming sick to the back teeth with politicians doing things that suit them, rather than the country.Whether we like it or not, the majority voted to leave the EU. But there is no doubt that some people feel they were misled or the terms weren’t explained to them. Andpeople were angry before the referendum, they are even angrier now.But they are going to have to find a dferent way to express it than by shouting threatening abuse in people’s faces.Politics is hard enough without fearing for your le and needing security to go to work.This country is changing — and not for the better. We have no tolerance for other people’s views, or when things don’t go the way we want them to. We all want our own way.The stakes are very high. And no one trusts their politicians to do what they want them to do in the way they want them to do it.So their response is to hunt them down and hurl abuse.It used to be that this sort of thing only happened on social media, and we all agreed it wouldn’t happen in real le. But look, it now is.People sending out this abuse should be held to account for their actions and words.Shouting in someone’s face in a threatening manner is not acceptable behaviour. It’s harassment and utterly deplorable.But also, politicians need to start building trust again. They need to say something and mean it,  and do the right things for the right reasons.I’M no stranger to criticism. And normally it’s water off a duck’s back.But I really take issue with being called a “passenger” this week, together with my friend Lord Sugar, for our attendance at the House of Lords.I want to make something very clear. Despite being a full-time CEO, I have voted in  per cent of isions, speak once a month and have never taken a penny of the daily expenses, allowances or fees. Lord Sugar, like me, does not take a single penny.People seem to misunderstand the role of the peers in the House of Lords. For a start, quantity has never equalled quality. But also, we do not implement legislation.We use our le skills and experience to help draft legislation and improve it by suggesting amendments that make the bills work better in the “real world”.Our second priority is to hold the Government to account by questioning ministers, seeking information and debating government policy.We also debate issues. In the Organ Donation debate I spoke in recently, contributors included a board member of patient groups, a surgeon, the chairman of the Royal College of Surgeons, a medical professor, a doctor and one of the heads of NHS Blood and Transplant – all of whom also happen to be peers making valuable contributions to help government work better.So I don’t like being called a passenger, because it’s wrong. The reason I am a peer is I want to try to help make the world a better place. That is my only motivation to be part of the House of Lords.So I’m a bit annoyed that Lord Sugar and I are being picked on because we are on the telly.We need peers to have real-world experience and make their contribution, which Lord Sugar and I do.We do it for free and we will keep doing so. And we will do so proudly.EEK! The Channel  show Shut-Ins: Britain’s Fattest People made for some seriously disquieting viewing on Wednesday.It’s hard for the average viewer to understand how someone could allow themselves to become so obese that they are bed-bound.Harder for me to understand is the people in that position who allow their children to become their carers.I know it’s not easy to lose weight and keep it off, but asking your eight-year-old to look after you is not only ruining your own le, but hers too.What child should be the main carer for their obese mother WHEN I read the break-up statement from Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, , and his novelist we, MacKenzie, earlier this week I was struck by how impressive it was.“If we had known we would separate after  years, we would do it all again,” the statement read.The couple wished each other well with no regrets and it sounded like the near-perfect separation.And then, the next day, came the news that photos of Bezos and the woman he has allegedly been having an affair with for the past eight months were about to be published.So I guess he jumped before he was pushed, as it were.How disappointing.I WATCHED a really disturbing clip this week of a hooligan sneaking up to a sleeping homeless man in Leeds and – to impress some of his yobbish mates – blasting a really loud air horn in his ear.It’s one of the most disgusting acts I have seen in a while.Tormenting those less fortunate than you and picking on them because you consider them worthless is the lowest of the low.Many people living on the street have addiction or mental health problems. Treating both is important.But just as important is treating all people with dignity.EQUALLY as shocking was the story about three men who attacked two others walking along London’s South Bank, apparently because they were holding hands.This blatant homophobia feels archaic – and needs to stop.I hope when the pathetic perpetrators are found they get more than a telling off and a caution.ANYONE  stle a yawn reading about writer Yann Moix, who said in an interview this week that he finds women of  “too old”.The Frenchman continued: “I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of.“The body of a -year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of  is not extraordinary at all.”Apparently Yann would be “incapable” of loving a woman aged  or above – despite being  himself.Let’s face it, any body belonging to a -year-old – male or female – is probably not what it was at .So since he seems to be talking only about attraction, not love, why on earth he thinks a woman of  will want to look at his body is anyone’s guess.But also, who would want to be with someone as superficial as this APPARENTLY, Wayne Rooney has been banned by we Coleen from leaving the house without her following his drunken arrest at a US airport.Ex-Manchester United star Rooney, , who now plays for Washington’s DC United in the US, was arrested for public intoxication on December  at the city’s Dulles International Airport.The former England captain received a furious phone call from Coleen, who apparently yelled at him: “How many times do you need to be told ”Oh dear. Poor Coleen, she’s got five children not four.How tiresome.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The full might of the British establishment has joined forces to overthrow the biggest democratic vote in our history.Together, they have strived to stop this country becoming truly independent once more. They have fought with the passion of true, eye-swivelling believers to keep us shackled to Brussels.AndTheresa May sees her deal voted down on Tuesday — and it looks like she is on course to suffer a defeat of historic proportions — they will take a great leap forward to achieving their goal.Oh, it will be dressed up and prettied to pretend that democracy still s in this country.There will be much prattle about “going back to the people” with another referendum. There will be talk about a “delay” in leaving the EU. It will all be meaningless flannel.The British elite wants to keep us inside the European Union. They are succeeding. Jolly well done, chaps.Never mind that a British Prime Minister, the coward David Cameron, looked us in the eye and told us our decision in the referendum was final.Never mind that the over- whelming majority of MPs in the House of Commons voted to trigger Article  and take us out of the EU.Never mind that at the General Election, both the major political parties stood on manestos that promised to honour the result of the referendum.Lies. Lies. Lies.Parliament is breaking with the people. Brexit is being stopped by the elite. The masters are taking back control of a people’s rebellion.But should we not all reflect for a moment on the consequences of Parliament’s break with the people There is currently no  for political extremists in this country, not the way that there is in European nations such as Germany, Spain, France and Greece.Historically, the British have never cared for the loony fringe extremism that has flourished — and frequently ruled — in other European nations.But I fear the democracy deniers of the British establishment are creating the perfect conditions for the rise of the nutters.WE DO NOT WANT TO LIVE IN THAT KIND OF COUNTRY.There were ugly scenes outside Westminster this week. Name calling, bullying and aggression. All of us should be striving to see it does not get far worse.The .million who voted for Brexit are not — and never have been — the knuckle-dragging morons of myth.Deny Brexit and they will not suddenly become violent thugs. But there are lunatics on the margins of our society who will feel enabled by an arrogant establishment recklessly and openly breaking with the democratic will of the British people.How can you not fear for our country’s future “LONDON is open,” preened London Mayor Sadiq Khan in his lavish, pro-Brussels fireworks display on New Year’s Eve.Yes, Sadiq – open for violence, open for gangs, open for murder.Two weeks into , London has already had four murders, including the killing of Jaden Moodie, a boy of  who was rammed off a moped, then repeatedly stabbed by three men.London had  murders in , many of them teenagers.Khan needs to stop posing and start getting some effective policing on the streets of our capital.THERE is one thing I truly don’t understand about the malcontents who spend their lives flying balloons, waving flags and raising their voices around Parliament Square.The UK employment rate is now at . per cent, an all-time high. Unemployment is at . per cent, the lowest since the Seventies.Don’t the flag-wavers outside Westminster have a job to go to COUNTDOWN star Rachel Riley has received a torrent of online abuse after criticising Jeremy Corbyn’s craven tolerance of anti-Semitism in the new Labour Party.“Surely you can have compassion and fight for the Palestinian cause without sharing your bed with Holocaust deniers and virulent anti-Semites,” Rachel, who is Jewish, told Channel  News.“Corbyn’s giving a legitimate voice to Holocaust deniers. It is a sad state of affairs when you have to be brave to speak out against anti-Semitism.”Anyone who thought that Rachel was just a TV cutie smiling bravely while she spelled out words like “orgasmed”, “gobshite” and “bumhole”has seriously underestimated her.Rachel Riley has courage, grace and eloquence. And she is not afraid of anyone.OLIVIA Colman is a national treasure.We have all loved her since Peep Show and will raise a glass on the happy day she is named a Dame.But I can’t help worrying that Olivia is just a teeny-weeny bit over-exposed.Colman is everywhere.Picking up a Golden Globe for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite. About to be seen on Netflix as Queen Elizabeth in series three and four of The Crown.As Madame Thénardier in the BBC’s adaptation of Les Miserables.Fronting UNICEF charity appeals and popping up in British Airways safety videos. Everywhere.I do hope Olivia wins Best Actress for The Favourite at the Academy Awards. When she has an Oscar, fewer people will be able to afford her.LOOKING just like one of the “gilets jaunes” – yellow vests – who rampage up and down the Champs-Elysees every weekend, Bella Hadid wears a hi-vis sleeveless jacket.Apparently, Bella’s yellow vest cost £. She should protest about that.IT was a relief to hear from Olivia Newton-John that she is not at death’s door as has ly been reported, but is alive, kicking and feeling good.Apparently, the confusion arose when it started getting about that the star of Grease had gone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So expect some politicians to miss the point entirely and make it more “inclusive”.ASKED to produce a list of the th Century’s most iconic explorers, everyone would probably name Scott of the Antarctic, Roald Amundsen, Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay.Everyone, that is, except a group of BBC “experts”, who ignored all of the above and replaced them with Jane Goodall and Gertrude Bell last week.I don’t even need to explain why, obviously.The names alone tell you it’s all down to the deranged, obsessive PC box-ticking that governs everything the BBC does and makes a farce of its new voting series Icons, which has the nerve to claim: “We want your opinion.”It doesn’t, obviously. It wants to impose the BBC’s right-on opinion on you and swallow its rewritten version of th Century history in the process.So for quota-driven reasons, Elvis didn’t make the entertainers shortlist and Alexander Fleming was left out of the last four scientists, despite discovering penicillin.But while Margaret Thatcher was included among the political finalists – and, boy, that must have hurt the BBC – they totally ignored her Falklands and Cold War victories in favour of re-styling her as a female gender warrior, almost the very last thing the former Prime Minister actually stood for.The episode where this series’ barmy levels of political correctness will really be laid bare is the Sports Stars episode, which has named Labour-supporting Paralympian Tanni Grey-Thompson as one of the th Century’s four greatest icons, but left out Jesse Owens, George Best, Usain Bolt, Rod Laver, Olga Korbut, Roger Federer, Eric Liddell, Martina Navratilova, Seb Coe, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Carl Lewis, Diego Maradona, Michael Jordan, Ayrton Senna and even the talisman of our greatest trophy-winning team of all, Doug Rougvie.Shameful.This Morning’s Alison Hammond, , metres above sea level, in the ski resort of Val D’Isere, interviewing skiers ­wearing skiing gear: “Why are you here ”THE Voice UK contestant Dean Mac is living the dream. How do we know He told us all, on Saturday night.“I’m living the dream,” he boasted, “in a really cool penthouse apartment, in the centre of Manchester. Duplex, with a pool table.”He also told us he performed “baby-making music,” though the world had been surprisingly slow to acknowledge Dean’s “triple threat” potential.“I went to LA, Paris, Liverpool, as a choreographer dancer, and one day a music producer said, ‘You need to be the front guy’.“The next stage now is to release the beast of my showmanship and have my craft appreciated.”So, on Saturday, he unleashed it in the direction of the four Voice judges and, honestly, the reaction was almost perfect.Hardly a serious button flinch or a twitch or a hint one of them was going to bite. In fact, he’d have had more luck getting the four heads on Mount Rushmore to turn.A response that said: “If that’s baby-making music, the human race is gone in  years’ time.”The saving grace of the ITV show’s format is that there’s nothing he could do or say to the judges afterwards either.Dean Mac just had to trudge back to his “really cool penthouse apartment”.Living the dream.Chris Kamara: “He headed his shot just over the bar.”The food: “Pizza, pasta, ravioli and all that s***.”I know. Close your eyes and you could almost be there. And s***.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “On a computer ­keyboard, the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”Gerry: “Up.”The Time It Takes, Joe Lycett: “Who wrote Handel’s Water Music ”Lindsey: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What name links a chocolate bar and a ship on which a mutiny occurred ”Lauren: “Cadbury.”And Ben Shephard: “In which century did the Second World War take place ”Vicky: “st.”An epidemic of head-tilting right-on morons telling us: “It takes a whole village to raise a child.”Loose Woman Gloria Hunnord conjuring up a horric mental image when she told ice-dancing Saira Khan: “I worry about you when the one-hand job comes in.”And Icons presenter Chris Packham boldly comparing himself to Marie Curie and Einstein with the observation: “I’m a bit of an outsider too.”Though, just so we can put their achievements in proper perspective, neither Marie Curie nor ­Einstein ever got their own episode of Celebrity Cash In The Attic.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I believe in fat-shaming.

Our Country, which airs on TV screens tonight, takes viewers on a three-minute journey from London to Rotherham and Snowdonia in a script narrated by Jeremy Corbyn. Loyalist MP Laura Pidcock features prominently in the clip alongside families and workers as Labours leader promises to end NHS privatisation, reform education and rebuild Britain. And theres one subject that appears very deliberately not to be mentioned - Brexit. The video takes the same tack as many of Mr Corbyns sessions at Prime Ministers Questions, which have aimed to broaden the debate to issues hitting peoples everyday lives.  Members and  MPs are piling pressure on Mr Corbyn to change his focus on Brexit, so to say Mr Corbyn cant avoid the issue is an understatement. But whatever you think of it - in the slim chance tonights no confidence vote does pass, this is a taste of what you can expect from the general election ahead.  Our Country belongs to all of us. A country that believes in fairness, that knows right from wrong. A country of shared ideals. We have a proud history of communities working together, supporting each other, even at the most dficult times. But our country has been moving in the wrong direction. The hard work and sacrices of so many have been given away to benefit a few. While many have struggled, a few grew richer and failed the country, plunging us into crisis and austerity. But it doesn’t have to be this way, we have the talent, we have the means, we have the creativity to be so much more.Labour believes in the people of this country. Their spirit, their enterprise, their kindness, their determination and sense of fairness, their commitment to their communities.Labour shares that commitment. And we won’t let that spirit be stled. We believe every single person deserves a chance.  Not to be held back, but to be encouraged, to be valued, and given respect. Labour’s vision for our country is one where we all support each other, instead of a race to the bottom. Together, we can reach our potential. Labour’s economic plan will work for all of us, in every part of our country. Instead of giving tax breaks to a few, we’ll invest in our people, in our country. We’ll create good jobs, with a living wage for everyone. We’ll end the privatisation of the NHS and fix the broken Care system to ensure dignity for our people in older age. We’ll create a National Education Service, to make education a right, not a privilege. We’ll give power back to local communities, helping them to protect the vital services on which we depend.  And abroad, Labour will search for peaceful solutions to conflict and we’ll be proud to stand up for what’s right. Because we believe in what our country can be: a country that doesn’t walk by on the other side, that cares for the most vulnerable, that rewards a hard day’s work. And supports people struggling to cope, a country that values all of its people, whatever their background and wherever they want to go. They’ll say it can’t be done. They’ll say we can’t afford it. But our country is one of the richest in the world. And we resolve to make a choice. We won’t stand by as our society is ided. Together we can change our country for the better. Labour will rebuild Britain for the many, not the few.

Yet within minutes, Downing Street insisted the stubborn PM would not budge on the plan that was heavily defeated on Tuesday. That response came after Jeremy Corbyn told Mrs May he would not enter talks with her unless she took no-deal Brexit off the table. The PM survived a bid to topple her when she won a no-confidence vote by  to ,thanks largely to her DUP pals and other Tories who just  hours earlier had decisively killed off her Brexit plans.   She immediately offered to hold one-to-one talks with Mr Corbyn and other party leaders in a bid to break the deadlock on our EU exit. But the Labour leader said: “Before there can be any positive discussions about the way forward, the Government must remove clearly once and for all the prospect of the catastrophe of a no-deal Brexit from the EU and all the chaos that would come as a result.” The PM had said: “I stand ready to work with any member of this House to deliver on Brexit.” She later confirmed Mr Corbyn had snubbed her invite for talks after she said she met with leaders of the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the SNP. She added: “I am shydisappointed that the leader of the Labour Party has not so far chosen to take part, but our door remains open.” Mrs May would have lost the no-confidence motion by just one vote had the DUP’s  MPs decided to vote against her.   There were accusations of hypocrisy levelled at the  Tories who helped bury her Brexit deal on Tuesday and the  who brought their own no-confidence bid on her leadership last month after not one Conservative voted against her. The DUP’s Westminster leader Nigel Dodds faced ridicule when he told MPs: “I’m always delighted when our opponents illustrate the strength of the relationship that we have, and what it is delivering for Northern Ireland.” Lib Dem Jamie Stone waved a credit card in his face – pointing to the poundbillion investment for Ulster the party was promised infor propping up Mrs May’s shygovernment after she blew her majority at the last election. Labour MPs rubbed imaginary notes between their fingers. And although Mrs May survived this no-confidence vote,she refuses DUP demands to dump the Irish backstop, she will require the support of Labour MPs to get a deal. The PM now has four days to try to come up with an shyalternative Brexit plan. She risks losing control of the process as MPs will be able to amend the fresh motion she tables next Monday.  They are expected to vote on a range of Plan Bs from a Norway-style deal to a second shyreferendum. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve launched two bills for a second shyreferendum yesterday while on Tuesday his colleague Nick Boles led a cross-party plan for MPs to seize control of Brexit. Both then still voted for Mrs May last night. And despite the Tories keeping her in office, the fragile party truce was close to breaking point. Party insiders admitted they were wary of a backlash from the Brexiteer Tories who she depended on to survive last night’s vote. Mrs May’s promise of “constructive” cross-party talks with backbenchers also soured as it became clear she expected her own deal to survive. The PM has come under intense shypressure from within to rip up her Brexit red lines – the areas on her EU withdrawal plan that she refuses to change, such as freedom of movement and leaving the Customs Union.   Tory veteran Ken Clarke said before last night’s vote: “Will the Prime Minister not – just as I have had to accept that the majority of this House is committed to the UK leaving the European Union – accept that she must now mody her red lines ” Justice Secretary David Gauke warned Mrs May she should not be “boxed in” by old promises. Labour’s Yvette Cooper said she had made compromise “impossible”. EU chiefs said they were prepared to renegotiate the Brexit deal –Mrs May drops her guarantees. With just  days to go until Brexit Day, she faces huge pressure to extend Article  to allow time to reach a fresh deal. Earlier, she appeared to keep the door open to the prospect. She said at PMQs : “The European Union would only extend Article  in the circumstances in which it was going to be possible to come to an shyagreement on a deal.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror its time lame","story":"NewsopinionVoice of The Mirror: Its time lame PM got real and faced the truthTheresa May limps on… still in office but hardly in power as the Brexit shambles continues with no clear end in sightShareCommentsByMirror :,  JAN NewsopinionThe enfeebled Prime Minister is plainly not up to the task in hand \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThanks to the DUP, Theresa May limps on… still in office but hardly in power. It is the country’s misfortune that it faces its greatest crisis since the Second World War with an enfeebled Prime Minister who is plainly not up to the task in hand. Having suffered the worst defeat in shyParliamentary history, Mrs May finally did what she should have done when taking office – she reached out to opposition leaders.   Their reticence in accepting this belated olive branch is understandable. The PM has shown no indication she is prepared to compromise on her Brexit plans. Her appeal for MPs to act in the national interest would carry more weight had she not put her own party’s interest first at every stage. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was right to demand taking no-deal off the table as the condition for any talks. Mrs May must show she is ready to make concessions. If she is sincere about wanting progress, she also needs to start showing some humility and realism about her diminished authority.

The three-and-a-half-year-old was squashed in the rear footwell of a blue Audi convertible by Stephen Waterson, who wanted to stretch his long legs out in the front, jurors were told. As the tot cried and made choking noises, his mother, Adrian Hoare, just told Alfie to be quiet, the Old Bailey heard. Hoare,  and Waterson, , from Croydon, south London, are on trial accused of his manslaughter. Emilie Williams, , was sitting next to Hoare in the back of the car during the ill-fated trip back from shopping in Sutton, south London, on February  last year.  In a videoed police interview, Miss Williams said they all went together, with Marcus Lamb, , driving. She said she was forced to put a second youngster in the rear footwell next to Alfie because she was not allowed to take the childrens car seat. Miss Williams said Alfie was crying so much it sounded like he was choking, but that his mother said he was OK. Marcuss chair was right forward and Stephens chair was right back, she said. Alfie was kicking the chair, asking him to move it forward.  Waterson said no because he said he had to stretch his legs right out, Miss Williams said. He had enough room but he wanted to stretch them out because his legs are quite long. He moved it forward once but only for a few seconds, only a little bit but it gave Alfie more room. Adrian just kept telling him to be quiet and they would be home soon. Like We will be home soon, shut up.  Miss Williams said Hoare told her Alfie was only crying because he was getting himself worked up. When he went quiet she thought he had gone to sleep, the court heard. As we was pulling up, she tried to wake Alfie up. She told him not to be silly. She thought he was just mucking around. When Waterson took Alfie out of the car, the child was looking pale and not moving, the witness said.  Afterwards, Waterson threatened Miss Williams as he tried to persuade her to lie about what happened, jurors were told. He was telling me a lot of things. He said he would put me in the boot of the car and get rid of me. He said he would kill me, she said. Hoare was going along with it and helping, she added. Giving evidence via video-link, Miss Williams told the court that Hoare had slapped her cheek outside Asda after Alfie died. She said: It was when Stephens door got kicked down by police. It only left a hand print for about half an hour.  Cross-examining, Tana Adkin QC said that, according to Waterson, some of the shopping was put into the front footwell of the car. The witness said she could not rememberthat was right. Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Miss Williams. Waterson has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and intimidation of Mr Lamb. The couple and Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making  statements to police.

Scotland and Wales are to follow suit this year, but England is yet to do so. It means the UK remains one of four European countries where smacking is permitted.Children’s Commissioner for England Anne Longfield yesterday renewed calls for a blanket ban.  She said: “The legislation in England, granting an exemption from the law on common assault to allow the physical punishment of children, is outdated. “It should be updated to reflect what the majority of parents believe: that hitting children is wrong.” On Tuesday, Jersey voted - in favour of the amendment to its Children Law . Children’s Minister Sam Mezec said: “We don’t have a good history when it comes to looking after children. It is right that we deal with this now.”  Bills closing the reasonable-force loophole are due to pass votes in Wales and Scotshyshyland but there are no plans in England and Northern Ireland. The Children Act  forbids hitting that causes bruises, cuts or scratches.

Andy Anokye faces some  charges, including  of rape, after it is said he inflicted pain and suffering on four women. The -year-old, who performs under the stage name Solo, committed the offences over two-year period, a jury heard today. He denies all the charges, which also include five counts of  imprisonment, two charges of assault by penetration and two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, told Bristol Crown Court the women genuinely and honestly inidually recounted how they experienced abuse at Anokyes hands. A particular feature of this interrogation was the water-boarding - placing a flannel or towel over their mouth and once in place, pouring water on to the flannel or towel, Mr Quinlan said.  The prosecution claims Anokye, of grime collective Boy Better Know, recorded sexual acts on his mobile phone, and committed sexual and physical violence on the women. The abuse involved a kne or knives and an interrogation of the women and their mobile phones, Mr Quinlan claimed.He added: The prosecutions case is that he appears to derive satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on these four women. He tortured and sexually violated each of them. His domination was physical and mental and it left each of them in fear. Mr Quinlan said that Anokye filmed the alleged abuse because he was confident the women would not disclose what had happened. He told the jury Anokye beat and frightened the women into submitting to his sexual demands. The court previously heard Anokye searched online for dacryphilia, where people are aroused by others in pain.  Anokye was arrested after one woman told a police officer he had assaulted and raped her at his flat in Canons Marsh, Bristol. Mr Quinlan said the woman had gone to the waterfront property, where Anokye became aggressive towards her. After detaining the woman, Anokye placed bleach on a cloth and put it over her face, the court heard. He told hershe passed out, she would wake up and think she was in a horror movie, Mr Quinlan said. He put the cloth over her face and mouth. You can imagine the terror. He strangled her with her own coat. Jurors were told Anokye slapped the woman and spat on her before asking her to put her hand in a blender. After leaving the flat, the woman met a friend who noticed she was upset and smelt of bleach, the court heard. Mr Quinlan said the woman disclosed the abuse to other friends, including a police officer.  She was later interviewed by officers from Avon and Somerset Police. Anokye was detained and told officers he and the woman had parted on decent terms after having sex. He said his sex with her was rough, strong and energetic but it was not one-sided, Mr Quinlan said. He said she was a willing participant in what he described as sex games, role play. He says the same in relation to each of the four complainants. Jurors have previously heard that the four women in the case do not know each other. Anokye, of Canons Marsh, Bristol, denies all the charges against him and the trial continues.

The Duke of Sussex is understood to be avoiding caffeine and alcohol to support the pregnant Duchess as part of a daddy detox. Harry, , has also reportedly become a yoga fan after being introduced by his we last year. And cigarettes are a thing of the past. According to reports, the father-to-be has started meditating every day, and people think this new pastime may have been inspired by his we. On the Duke and Duchesss first official engagement of the year on Monday, in Birkenhead, Prince Harry revealed his new hobby.   People claims Prince Harry chatted with a -year-old Buddhist monk named Kelsang Sonam in the Merseyside town, telling him about his daily meditation habit. Kelsang reportedly presented him with a copy of a book called  Steps to Happiness. Meghan, who announced shes six months pregnant on the day out, is also known to be a big fan of meditation. The former Suits actress once posted about it on her now defunct lestyle blog, The Tig. On the blog she admitted she had been daunted by the prospect of meditation at first and worried she would find it boring.  However she stuck with it and claims it made her much happier. She previously wrote: Last week marked the one year anniversary of my relationship with meditation, something I found endlessly daunting at first , but soon became the quietude that rocked my world. I cant put my finger on the why or the how, but I will tell you this much, for me...I am just happier. And meditation has so much to do with that. I urge you to give it a shot. The worst thing that can happen is that you gave yourself ten minutes of quiet in an endlessly loud world. Shhhhh......it feels good.  The Duke and Duchess home new pound million home will feature its own mother-and-baby yoga studio with a floating floor, according to reports. The couple have gained permission from planners to include the spring floor as part of major taxpayer funded renovations at their cottage in Windsor, the Sunday Express says. They will eventually move intoFrogmore Cottage- a grade II listed property - when the work is finished in the spring. The yoga room is among a range of amendments the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are making to the house - previously five apartments used as staff quarters.  Sources have said the room is among the changes to allow the family to enjoy regular yoga sessions, according the Express. Harry has also had exercise sessions at a pound-a-month Cha gym which offers yoga, weight-lting and boxing, as well as bespoke diet plans, according to the Daily Mail.

Chloe Hodson used to eat up to  cubes of sugar a day in her cups of tea alone but when doctors told her she needed to lose weight to fall pregnant she cut them out entirely. She then found out she was pregnant the day before she was expected to start fertility treatment. The simple lestyle change helped the -year-old to have her little boy Joel Gwilt two years after a devastating polycystic oy syndromediagnosis dashed her hopes at being a mum. She and partner Jonathan Gwilt had planned to have fertility treatment to help them have a child, but doctors warned Chloe that she would need to lose weight to have the medication.   At st oz, Chloe spent eight months swapping out her daily lunches at Greggs, microwave meals and sugar in her tea to lose one and a half stone. She was shocked when, the night before she was due her first fertility appointment, she took a pregnancy test on the off-chance and discovered she was pregnant. The mum-of-one credits her weight loss - and sugar-free cuppas in particular - with helping her to have miracle son Joel Gwilt, now five months old. Chloe, from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, said: I spent many nights crying because I didnt think I would ever be able to have kids. The aim was to lose the weight to start the fertility medication but it turned out just losing the weight in my case was just what I needed to boost my fertility.   The best thing I did was cut sugar out of my tea because I would always have one or two sugars in my tea, and I have five or six cups of it a day. If there was a low sugar or salt version of what I wanted to buy then Id have that instead of the normal one. I eat a lot more home-cooked meals whereas before I was eating a lot of microwave meals. When I found out I was pregnant, I honestly couldnt believe it. I ran into my living room and said to my partner, look, look at this, is that a plus  It looks like a plus to me, is that a plus . He didnt know because it was really faint, so we took another one. I didnt need to pee again so I was downing all the water, we got the second test and that had the faint plus on it as well. I was so shocked I just stood there and I thought oh my god, its finally happened, Im pregnant.   I was so happy. I was honestly so over the moon with it. But I was scared at the same time because it was whether it was actually happening. They say with PCOS, you can have problems with the pregnancies. I was thinking, I am finally pregnant this time but is it going to go to full term  I was scared that while I had had the chance of being pregnant, will I have the chance of having my baby  Although Chloe had had painful and irregular periods since she was  years old, she never sought a formal diagnosis until she and Jonathan decided to start trying for a baby. The hopeful mum-to-be burst into tears when an ultrasound and internal scan confirmed that she had PCOS, a common oian condition which affects one in five women. Chloe said: As soon as I saw the scan I knew what it was and I burst out in tears. I was crying to the nurse, and then when I was in the car on the way home I rang my mum and I was crying to my mum. I was saying Ill never have kids, its all over. I dont know what to do. Once theyd diagnosed the polycystic oies they said to start the fertility medication I had to lose weight first before they could put me on it. It was about a stone and a half that I lost. It took me about eight months. With polycystic oies as well, some of the hormones actually stops you from losing weight as quickly as other people would.   Usually it would just be cutting out the junk food. Beforehand it was nearly every meal. It was just convenient because I had to be at work for am and I was getting back at pm and at that point I was so tired I couldnt be bothered to cook a proper meal. It would just be two minutes in the microwave and that would do. Because we were trying and because I had polycystic oies anyway, every time I didnt get a period I would take a pregnancy test on the off chance it had worked that time. For nearly two years, taking a pregnancy test every couple of months it really gets you down. But then the night that we found out, it was about  oclock at night and I had two pregnancy tests. I thought I might as well just see because it could be it this time. I took the pregnancy test and it was the faintest little plus time. I found out I was pregnant the night before I was going to start fertility treatment. I was going to start the medication and talk through how it all works, what dosage to go on. I rang them up in the morning and said, no need, thank you, Im pregnant. As soon as I got off the phone with them I rang my doctors and said can I get an appointment now just to check everything is fine. They booked me in for a scan and said, yep, % pregnant. I worked hard to keep the weight down while I was pregnant and I went for regular weight checks at the doctors too. Eventhere was a slight little problem or worry it was straight to the doctors to find outeverything was okay. Although she also suffered hyperemesis gravidarum that caused extreme vomiting and once even hospitalised, Chloe was delighted when little Joel was born on August  , weighing lb oz. She is now speaking out to help other couples struggling to conceive to seek helpthey think they need it. Chloe said: I was exhausted after the birth. But its just strange. I remember seeing him, seeing this baby and knowing that he was my baby. It took a couple of hours, once I was back home, for it to sink in. This was my son - he was finally here. I have him for the rest of my le now. Its amazing. I think weve been very lucky because he sleeps through the night, he barely cries for attention. Hes eating well, sleeps well and is always smiling. Everyone always says how much of a smiley baby he is. He is just genuinely such a good boy and I wouldnt change him for the world. He was worth the wait. I wish now Id sought out help earlier, because I had painful periods even in my teenage years. It was really and I should have got it looked at then. They would have picked it up them. I would have been more prepared instead of getting that shock when I wanted a baby. Before they get diagnosed, half the time women just pass [PCOS] off as a painful period and think theres nothing wrong. I would say go with your gut instinct, get yourself checked out first. Sometimes the weight loss does help. In my case it did. But it doesnt work for everybody. You need to stay on track, keep doing what the doctors are advising and evenit doesnt seem to be working, evenyou need the medication, do it. At the end of it, you will get your child.

During her visit, the Duchess of Cambridge, , discussed her children and was stumped when asked whether or not the Queen enjoys eating pizza. But the most interesting part of the engagement was perhaps when she began talking about her own personal favourite pizza toppings. And its fair to say the things she likes are a little controversial.   While one child said theyd like to put cheese and cucumber on their pizza, Kate responded by saying she preferred to have bacon on hers. Her reason for choosing this topping  Because apparently pepperoni is too spicy. WHAT ! She said: Has anyone ever put bacon on the pizza before  I quite like that, because its like having pepperoni but its not spicy. Very good.   And while its fair to say bacon on pizza is a tasty treat, her ideas on the spiciness of pepperoni warranted further discussion. People on social media jumped on her comments and shared their thoughts. Caity Weaver shared a clip of Kate talking about pizzas on Twitter and alongside it wrote: In this video I will never forget, Kate Middleton advocates bacon as a pizza topping because its like having pepperoni, but its not as spicy. Over  people have liked her post so far, with many taking the time to respond.   One person tweeted: God that is so f***ing English. Another said: Its almost stereotypical. A third commented: Pepperoni is SPICY     This is just about the saddest thing Ive ever heard, added a fourth.   However not everyone thought Kates opinions were weird. A dferent user suggested that her preferences may have changed since she had children.

Lexie Sienna Bryant lived in her mothers womb for two weeks after her brother, Kobi Nathaniel, died. She was then born prematurely at  weeks weighing just lbs oz. Before her arrival, doctors had already warned mum Gemma Bryant she would likely give birth to her within days of Kobi, who was born at  weeks. However staff at Hull Women and Childrens Hospital were amazed as it was a further  days before Mrs Bryant, , went into labour for a second time which gave Lexie a much better chance. After spending  days in the neonatal intensive care unit , Lexie was allowed to go home - with oxygen and a feeding tube - and has now turned one. East Yorkshire mum Gemma told Hull Live: Lexie is going from strength to strength everyday.   She is still under a specialist about her eyesight as she is short sighted and will need glasses by the age of three, but otherwise she is doing great. Even the physiotherapist hasn’t had to help her in any way as she is progressing well on her own, she really is a miracle. We are so proud of her everyday she is so very precious to us.  She rolls over and is still learning to sit up but it is to be expected that she will need more time to meet her goals, but otherwise doing us all proud. The twins were due to be born in May , but Mrs Bryants waters broke the day before she was due to go for her -week scan. The mum, who, along with husband James, has five sons between them, knew it was too early for her twins to be born and was told to prepare for losing them both.   It was eight days later, on Christmas Eve, when she went into full labour and Kobi was tragically born sleeping - with lungs too underdeveloped to be saved. After Lexie was born in January, she was rushed to NICU and she was  days old before her parents could give her a first cuddle. At the time, heartbroken Gemma spoke of a bittersweet rollercoaster of emotions after the pain of losing her son followed by the joy of giving birth to baby Lexie. Mrs Bryant said celebrating Lexies first birthday has been amazing. She said: Her birthday was amazing, it was such a happy day for us all we feel so lucky to be celebrating her special day, time really has flown past since her being born. We will be forever thankful for what the Nicu staff did for her and us.

The -year-old woman, known only by her first name Lynda, had a five-minute conversation on a train journey with a man called Josh. She said during their brief exchange of words, they made small talk about the weather. The only information that the student, of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire offered the man was her name and age. Despite the short chat, Josh managed to track her down on Instagram then contacted her friends until someone gave him her phone number. Lynda uploaded screen shots of their text conversation on Twitter, and has been flooded with responses comparing him to Joe Goldberg, in Netflix thriller You.

After receiving the first text from Josh, Lynda said she quickly became creeped out. He wrote: Yo its me Josh from the train the other day. This was followed by: Got ur number from one of ur friends hope u dont mind [sic]. Lyndas response was that she found his message kind of creepy and asked which of her friends passed on her number.  She then questioned how he managed to track down her friends in the first place. He replied: I searched u on insta an you follow some people I know so I asked about u [sic]. When Lynda asked why he did not follow her on Instagram, he replied that he only send messages on social media to girls that he wants to pipe. Josh added that he wanted to get to know her better.

Its now so successful that Liv Conlon, now , has hired her mum and brother to work for her. Straight-A student Liv, from Glasgow, stunned teachers when she told them she was dropping out before her final year to launch an interior design company. The young entrepreneur - who made pound, from her first business importing goods from China and selling them online at  - was certain she could make a go of it. She started ThePropertyStagers, which furnishes empty homes, with no financial backing.   The business made pound, in its first year, and turned over poundmillion in its second, when Liv was just .She now furnishes more than  properties a year, and has hired a team of  people – including her mother Ali, , and her brother Jack, .Liv has bought and renovated her own one-bedroom flat, which has now doubled in value to pound, – all without the help of the Bank Of Mum And Dad.And she believes being bullied every day at school for four years made her more determined to succeed. She said: I’ve always known from a very young age that I wanted to have my own business because I don’t take direction very well. When I was at school I always wanted to leave, I never wanted to be there. I just wanted to be in charge of my own le. I was very competitive at school, so I was always top of the class, so I guess people are threatened by that, which just brought people to dislike me. In my second to last year I decided to move school because after four years [of being bullied] I’d had enough of it. I decided that I didn’t want these negative people in my le who made me feel terrible every day.It made me more determined. Everyone who’s ever doubted my ability or capability or challenged that have completely put a fire in my stomach to go on and be better. The idea for ThePropertyStagers came about after Liv asked to furnish a property her mother, who ran a successful training business, had been struggling to sell for three months. They knew about property stagers, but were unable to find an affordable company, so Liv, who was living at home at the time, decided to do it herself. After Liv decorated the home’s interior with furniture and accessories, it sold within three days, for above the asking price – and the buyer even paid extra for everything in the property too. Liv, who left school before her final year with five Higher A grades, realised there was a gap in the market, and so the idea for ThePropertyStagers was born. She said: It was a pretty scary thing to do. I really could have gone on to do anything I wanted at university, so when I put to the school that I wanted to leave before my final year, they called me into the careers office and sat me down and said are you crazy, why are you leaving school when you have the opportunity to do anything you want  Liv, who works seven days a week and has just won a business award, revealed she first generated clients at local networking events, but admits because she was so young, she wasn’t taken seriously. She admitted that people probably doubted my ability, adding: It was quite a challenging environment to go into as the property industry is pretty much male-dominated.It was -year-old men, and I was coming in at the time with blonde, long curly hair and I actually looked . To start with my age worked against me.A few people probably doubted my ability until I started to get a bit more successful and build up a reputation. However, by explaining to potential clients how they could generate more money by selling properties that were ‘staged’ with cushions, throws and furniture, Liv managed to secure her first client.  She said: I started the business with absolutely no start-up funds. I went out to networking events which were free, and spoke to people and I was obviously looking to get business.From there, I was paid by the client for the installation, and then I would use that money to buy all furniture for that property – so the first couple of jobs, I never really made much money because I had to buy the stuff with the money I was charging them.The more installations I got to do, I could recycle the furniture, so that’s when it started to become profitable. Liv’s first paid job was staging a one-bedroom flat in Glasgow, which she kitted out with all the Ikea furniture she could fit into the back of her Vauxhall Corsa. After going it alone, Liv began to see the business start to take off when she became more active on social media. She said: I used to be a person who posted [on Facebook] only once a year. When I started to post photos of the business, it started to become a lot more successful - people started to know the name and know what I was trying to do. Her company became so busy, that Liv was generating enough income to employ her mother as her operations manager.At the time, Ali had her own successful customer service company for the motor industry, which she’d started  years ago, but she jumped at the chance to work with her daughter.  Liv admits she earns more than both her mother and her brother – who works for her as a stager – and she has the final say on decisions. The young business woman said while growing up, she would often attend business events with Ali – who even took her to a conference in LA when she was just . She was encouraged to listen to audio books by business gurus and motivational speakers such as Tony Robbins. Liv said of being her mother’s boss: ‘We’ve got a very unique relationship – we spend most hours of every day together.’ However, Ali admits that many people jump to the conclusion that it’s her business – and that Liv works for her. Ali said: I have to tell them that Olivia actually gave me a job. But it shows you how ageist people can be.  I’m very proud that she got so busy. My business was quite successful but it’s been a dream of mine to work with her so it was an ideal opportunity to do it. The duo admit that working together as mother and daughter isn’t for everyone. Ali, who separated from Liv and Jack’s father three years ago after  years of marriage, confessed: It’s never come to blows – and we’ve never left the day not speaking to each other, but obviously there have been some tough days.I think sometimes you say things to each other that you might not say to others because you’re family.You can be very honest with each other and you’re not always diplomatic.But when push comes to shove, Olivia will make the decisions. Even though ThePropertyStagers is now enjoying financial success, it hasn’t all been plain sailing.In the early days, Liv admits she sometimes felt as though she was winging it – and would go to great s to save money. Liv said: I used to hire a man in a van to pick up furniture.There was a sofa I forgot to tell him about, so he was going to charge me pound to pick it up. I was appalled at that so said I would do it myself. I drove a three-and-a-half hour round trip to fit these sofas in the back of my car, I couldn’t get in the car, spent two hours trying to stuff them in, then I had to carry them up four flights of stairs, all for pound. I must have spent hundreds of pounds trying to get them there.But that’s the stubborn person in me trying to save money when I was just a one-man-band. Even though the business is now a huge success, Liv is still very careful with her income.She doesn’t splash her cash on designer clothes and handbags – instead, she reinvests it back into the business, although she does enjoy ‘the odd margarita’. Liv, who believes millennials are taught to ‘dim our light and not shine so bright’, admits it’s been a ‘long, hard journey’, and working -hour days and six or seven days a week has been the norm. Although as she’s ‘not a party girl’, Liv doesn’t feel as though she’s missed out on socialising, she does believe running her own business has meant she’s had to grow up fast. She said: I missed out on being young with fewer worries – I could have a lot less worries at this stage [of my le] such as paying staff, and keeping everything going.Running a business, you have quite a lot of responsibilities for other people’s lives as well.  Her work-le balance has taken its toll on her personal le, though. Liv split with her boyfriend and admits being with someone as determined to succeed as her would take ‘a certain level of person’.When you’re young and you’ve had the success so young, it’s challenging to be with someone and them accept that work is very important to you, she said.Over Christmas, Liv spearheaded the #HomeChristmasMakeover in Glasgow – making over the homes of  families who are living in temporary accommodation.She said it’s taking part in initiatives like this that make her feel ‘most fulfilled’.Speaking about her plans for , Liv said: We’ve got massive plans for ThePropertyStagers, and one of those is to double the turnover this year, which is a big challenge. Another plan is to franchise part of the business.But something that is close to her heart, is becoming a motivational spokesperson for other young people, to show them that going to university isn’t the only route available after school.She said: My main mission is to really inspire young people to start business and be entrepreneurial.There’s this real thing aboutyou’re doing well at school you should be a lawyer or a doctor. A lot of people I went to school with who had similar grades to me went on to do university courses because their parents wanted them to.I’d love to educate parents and schools that there are other options than going to university. It’s still an option. But you can make a success at starting a business at a young age. Andall it went wrong tomorrow, Liv says she would start up another business.She added: I’ve got the mind-set that I’ve made money once, so I could come up with a new idea,it did all fail tomorrow, I’m sure I’d find a way to do something .

The womans younger son, said to be aged two, is seen standing nearby and witnessed the act throughout.   It reportedly happened after the two brothers had been fighting. Police in Illinois say they are investigating the clip and have identied the woman. No charges have been filed but the boys are now staying with a relative for the short term.  It comes a day after shocking footage appeared to show a toddler in just his underwear clinging to the roof of his mums moving car .Horried witnesses desperately tried to get the mums attention and other drivers flashed their lights and honked horns in Perth, Australia. One onlooker she felt sick to the stomach after seeing the young child hang onto the roof rack for at least  minutes while the mother was allegedly unaware.

Julen Rosello, two, fell down the -inch borehole in a freak accident at around pm on Sunday while his dad Jose prepared a family paella. A rescue team have still to confirm the location of the missing boy underground. On Wednesday morning, hair believed to belong to the youngster was found in a blockage of earth and sand around ft under the ground.Julens parents Jose and Vicky, both , have spent day and night at the spot near Totalan - a half-hour’s drive from the Costa del Sol capital of Malaga. It is now the scene of a massive search and rescue operation involving police, firefighters, Civil Protection workers and private sector experts. Jose said: “We’re dead inside but with the hope we have an angel watching over us who is going to help him to come out alive as soon as possible.”   Asked what was giving him strength, he added: “Knowing that I’m going to see my son alive.” Jose and fast food restaurant worker Vicky, who live in the Malaga neighbourhood of El Palo, lost a three-year-son two years ago. Oliver died instantly after suffering a heart attack in May  which was believed to be linked to a congenital heart defect. Jose recalled the moment he realised Julen had disappeared down the borehole. He told a Spanish TV programme: “I was putting some more wood on for the fire and ran towards him.   “My cousin was a bit nearer and threw herself on the ground as I reached the orice. “He had already gone. I heard him cry at first but then I didn’t hear him cry anymore.” Fighting back tears in an emotional message to his son, he said: “The only thing I can say is ‘Stay calm Julen. Daddy loves you and your brother is going to help us.’” In an interview with Malaga-based paper Sur he added: “My we went to phone into work to let them know she wasn’t going. “She was with Julen and asked me to keep an eye on him as she made the call. He was only a few feet away. “I went to get a couple of logs for the fire for the paella and he began to run. “We saw how he fell down the hole, my cousin more than me because she was closer.” A Swedish firm which helped locate the  Chilean miners rescued in  after  days underground has joined the massive operation to try to locate Julen. Civil Guard officers leading the operation have not yet spotted the youngster on a rotating camera lowered into the borehole on a robot, retrieving only a bag of sweets and a plastic cup from the same blockage of sand and earth where the boy’s hair was discovered. Police insist they are working on the basis Julen is still alive, although privately officials have admitted the chances he will have survived what is likely to be more than  hours underground are slim unless he is in an air pocket and has access to water.   Officials have said they hope to reach Julen between  and  hours from the start of excavation work on a new tunnel on Wednesday night. Work to ‘suck’ off earth and sand in the hole was hampered by machinery breakage.Julen’s dad has revealed the borehole was made by a prospector at the request of his cousin’s boyfriend but no water had been found.  The prospector has told police he complied with the law by sealing the hole after it was made but Julen’s family say it had simply been covered with stones that were not properly laid. A distressing report published by Spanish news website El Espanol at lunchtime today claimed the boy’s body had been found in the well.This report was dismissed as a  alarm by government officials and police. The website later withdrew its report from its website, prompting anger from social media users and a tweet from a regional emergency services coordinator which said: “Don’t report  news. “Trust only official sources and don’t spread rumour or information that hasn’t been confirmed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"loneliest frog world finally gets","story":"NewsWorlds loneliest frog finally gets a date - after  years on his ownA frog who has been on his own in an aquarium for  years is finally going to be getting some companyShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news weird-news video meet-romeo-worlds-loneliest-frog-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLast year, Romeo the Sehuencas water frog, hit the headlines when scientists created a match dating profile for the little green guy. The lonely frog was believed to be the only one of his species left in the world and as such had spent  years all on his own. He subsequently became known as the worlds loneliest frog. So, taking action, Global Wildle Conservationand the Bolivian Amphibian Initiative joined forces to find a mate for Romeo, in order to ensure the survival of his species.   Speaking about Romeo last February, Arturo Muno, founder of the Bolivian Amphibian Initiative explained: When biologists collected Romeo  years ago, we knew the Sehuencas water frog, like other amphibians in Bolivia, was in trouble, but we had no idea we wouldnt be able to find a single other inidual in all this time. Romeo started to call for a mate about a year after he was brought into captivity. But those calls have slowed in the last few years. We dont want him to lose hope. Now, almost a year later, it seems he may have finally found himself his very own Juliet - thanks to a little help from a few humans.   According to the BBC, scientists have found five more Sehuencas water frogs during an expedition to a remote Bolivian cloud forest. The frogs were captured, with a plan to breed them and re-introduce them back into the wild. Teresa Camacho Badani, the chief of herpetology at the Museo de Historia Natural Alcide dOrbingy in Cochabamba City, says the female frog they have found is very dferent from Romeo, but she is hopeful that opposites will attract.   She said: Romeo is really calm and relaxed and doesnt move a whole lot. Hes healthy and likes to eat but he is kind of shy and slow. [Juliet] is really energetic, she swims a lot and she eats a lot and sometimes she tries to escape. As well as Juliet, scientists also found one other female and three male Sehuencas. They are the first of their kind to be seen in the wild in over a decade. The frogs are currently being kept in quarantine at the museum.

The elite soldier, who is in Kenya training the countrys special forces, was on an admin run when al-Shabaab terrorists stormed the nearby hotel complex, killing  people, including a British charity worker. And he sprinted back to his car, where he had left his equipment, before heading to the hotel to take on the terror gang single-handedly. It had been reported that the soldier, a serving member of the elite unit, had been taking part in training Kenyan troops when they got word of the attack and went to respond. But Chris, who served in the elite regiment for  years, said: He was out shopping on an admin run. He had his equipment in the car, so when it all kicked off he sprinted back to his car and quickly got kitted up before heading straight towards the firefight.  When he arrived in the hotel he started organising the entire operation, directing the police and army. Then he went in there on his own to neutralise the enemy and rescue the hostages. His actions certainly saved many lives and shows the manner of these men, who are extremely brave and always ready. Pictures and video from the scene show the SAS operative in jeans and body armour, holding a gun, as he escorts bystanders out of the DusitD hotel to safety. The weapon he is seen clutching is a Diemaco C Carbine - standard issue for Special Forces soldiers. Chris, who served in the highly-secretive regiment for  years, said footage of the soldier showed he is a highly trained fighter who instinctively knew what he needed to do to save lives. And he praised his “creativity” in instructing Kenyan forces to block off roads and exits and storm the hotel on his own.  Best-selling author Chris, whose books are inspired by his SAS bravery, said: “That’s just what the guy does, it’s his nine to five job. He’s trained to the highest level to react to these types of situations.And counter terrorism operations are just bread and butter to him. “He was already there training Kenyan special forces, and then these guys go out to react to situations, and that’s how he was out on the ground. “The calibre of these types of soldiers is such that the other side,al-Shabaab, wouldn’t stand a chancethey came up against this guy. “He is trained to react to the threat. He will instinctively locate the threat, identy it and then neutralise it.  “His tactic is to shoot the enemy before they get a chance to shoot themselves. “You can see from the videos that he wasn’t cowering anywhere, he was aggressively moving on to targets, on the prowl hunting these animals down. “He was dominating the firefight, switching everything from their surprise attack to them being hunted, because they’ve now got a professional solider in the thick of it going after them.” Chris said he was impressed - but not surprised - at how the soldier took control of the situation, directing the Kenyan police and army as he engaged with the terror gang. He said: “Because the guy was part a training team out there, he was already up to date on every tactic they use and how to react.  “These guys can read the situation on the ground, immediately without briefings, and then they can adapt to that situation. “Obviously the guy had all the equipment with him, he had the weaponry, body armour and magazines, so once he was there it was just a case of reacting to the situation, finding the target and putting it down. “The Kenyan forces reacted first, but when he arrived on the scene he took over and started guiding everyone into firing positions, and then bringing the civilians out to safe havens. “You saw he was going in and bringing people out then putting them into a safe area and then going back in. For him that’s as normal as someone  going in to the office and doing their job. It’s as basic as that.  “He’s going in to an area where he will have trained countless times to engage targets and then cover your flanks and protect your flanks, using buildings, vehicles, and other structures to cover himself. “But then as soon as he sees a target he will engage that target. And I can guarantee he will be a hell of a lot more accurate with his weapon that the al-Shabaab guy. “So he will be putting a piece of lead through them and then moving on to the next one. It’s as simple as that really.”  And he said the soldier obviously made a calculated decision to go in alone, believing that it would be better than taking in less professional local troops. He said: “Clearly the guy is really creative. In every footage I’ve seen of him he’s doing it alone and hasn’t taken any of the local forces to give him back up. He’s taken the fight to these guys on his own. “He’s very confident, he knows his capabilities, and he will have a very high understanding of who he was going after. “Sometimes you’re better off working by yourself because around the world certain armies can get a bit fired up, and start firing off rounds. Then you have a big threat of blue on blue. “So he probably felt safer by placing the local security services, police and army, in places, telling them not to move, and to provide him cover. “He might have told the security services to maybe block a street off as he goes in, or to cover exits of buildings so when he goes in and flushes anybody out for them to maybe engage. “That is everything SAS soldiers are training to do, instinctively. It’s second nature to them.” "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/01/medw-Liam-Kennedy.jpg ","title":"andrew davies could be the difference between dundee staying up or going down","story":"Andrew Davies could be the dference between Dundee staying up or going down according to the man who’s seen plenty of him this season.The former Ross County skipper has teamed up with his old Staggies gaffer Jim McIntyre once more at Dens Park after switching from Hartlepool to the Dark Blues on a free transfer on Thursday.The signing has been met with a degree of concern for the -year-old’s injury history.The centre-back has a recurring problem which has to be managed, however,Dundee can get him in the team for the majority of the remaining  league games, that might be enough.That’s the view of former Tele football writer Liam Kennedy, who’s seen plenty of Davies this season with his patch now covering Hartlepool United in the National League.He said: “He’ll not play week in, week out because of a recurring nerve problem he has butDundee get  games out of him between now and the end of the season that might be enough.“When he signed, he and Liam Noble from Notts County were seen as the marquee signings in the summer. After last season, everyone expected a struggle but when they came in expectations changed to possibly a top-seven finish.“Up until October that was probably on the cards but they’ve dropped like a stone since, though that’s not to do with Davies. When he’s played he’s been excellent.”Quickly after signing for his boyhood club Pools in the summer, Davies was made club captain – a role he performed with distinction at Ross County, too – but Kennedy says Hartlepool’s loss will be Dundee’s gain.“He’s played for some good clubs and Dundee fans can look forward to him putting his head or whatever in where it hurts,” he added.“He’s somebody who plays for the badge and is a real battler, aggressive and whole-hearted.“Getting  games from him might be the dference between staying up and going down for Dundee.“Going away to a tough place like Aberdeen or Hearts or Hibs and you need somebody to head away every ball and give everything to win, he’s your man.“That’s something Hartlepool never had last season and I’m disappointed they’ve lost him for his leadership.“He’s a real leader and they’ll miss his presence around the place.“He was brilliant at times in the National League. It’s a really physical league, every team has massive strikers and lots play route one and he’s perfect for that.“He’s got such a good leap and there weren’t many better defenders in the league than him.”As well as a leader, Dundee have signed themselves a fighter – something that can get the better of him every now and then.“He loves a battle but lets it spill over a bit sometimes, which is the down side.“He got sent off at Wrexham after half an hour for nutting somebody and they got beat –he’s only playing  games or so then Dundee can’t be having him suspended and missing games.“You take that side away totally, though, and he’s not half the player.“He plays right on the edge but I’d be surprisedthere’s anybody in the Premiership will beat him in the air.“He’s also clever with his positioning so doesn’t get caught out by pace too much – he was the best defender in the National League because of that.“He’ll crank it up in training and will be putting the foot in when required when some wouldn’t and might just spark something in others.“Jim McIntyre knows him andhe’s looking for somebody with a nasty streak, they’ve picked the right man.”"},{"url":null,"title":"andy dales to join dundee but another signing needed after andrew davies blow","story":"Jim McIntyre was boosting his Dundee squad with the arrival of English winger Andy Dales yesterday but is set to resume his search for a centre-half after injury fears over another new signing Andrew Davies was confirmed.Twenty-four-year-old Dales was due at Dens for training yesterday morning after the Dark Blues agreed a deal with Scunthorpe.The former Derby kid can play on either flank and also in a central role.After  years in the youth ranks at the Rams, Dales stepped down to non-league football before moving to Scunthorpe last summer.

That’s a worry.Seven goals in his first  games after arriving from Danes Aalborg in August suggested the man to get the goals to fire them to promotion had been found.The last seven games, with just one strike to his credit, have dampened such expectations.And while that work he puts in when up front, often on his own, means he continues to be a vital cog in the wheel for the team, there is little question he’d benefit from a regular strike partner.Of course, the arrival of Nesbitt and Smith should help ease the burden on whoever is right up front but only to a degree.Both are capable of chipping in with goals but a good chunk of the work they do is likely to be in creating chances as opposed to taking them.Putting more goals in the team would also ease the pressure on the defence.While the back four have been leaking too many goals this season, they’ve too often taken to the pitch knowing the loss of just one goal may well see a point or points dropped.That’s why the next couple of weeks will see Neilson, presumably backed by new owner Mark Ogren’s money, pull out all the stops to find another quality striker.Particularly in this transfer window, that’s usually easier said than done.If he succeeds and United are back in the top flight come the end of the season it would have been well worth the effort."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-andy-murray-from-dunblane-to-double-olympic-champion","story":"FROM gangly, wild-haired teenager to one of Britainrsquos great sporting heroes, Sir Andy Murray may have been forced to hang up his rackets but his impact will be felt for generations."},{"url":null,"title":"dennys-bosses-slam-unforgiving-customers-after-being-bombarded-with-terrible-reviews","story":"DENNYrsquoS bosses have hit back at ldquounforgiving customers who have left negative feedback after visiting the dinerrsquos newly-opened branch near Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"damien-duff-and-stephen-mcmanus-take-up-coaching-roles-at-celtic","story":"Celtic have confirmed that Damien Duff and Stephen McManus will join the clubs coaching staff, with former Republic of Ireland internationalist Duff taking charge as reserve team coach and McManus assuming the position of under- coach."},{"url":null,"title":"businessman-oli-norman-takes-full-control-of-seven-popular-glasgow-venues-in-15m-deal","story":"A GLASGOW entrepreneur has snapped up full control of seven popular city venues in a deal worth over pound million."},{"url":null,"title":"social-media-star-oli-keenan-to-represent-uk-in-performing-arts-olympics","story":"The mastermind behind the smash viral video of Pennywise the Dancing Clown on Halloween has been selected to represent the UK in the World Championships of Performing Arts."},{"url":null,"title":"indyref-2-statement-in-matter-of-weeks-says-nicola-sturgeon","story":"Nicola Sturgeon said she will speak about the timing of a second independence referendum in a ldquomatter of weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"straight-talking-damien-duff-ready-to-make-his-coaching-mark-at-celtic","story":"Damian Duff has conceded that one of his failings is a tendency to curse too much but the former Republic of Ireland internationalist is sworn to getting the best out of those in the underbelly at Celtic."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-keeping-tabs-on-scott-mctominay-situation-as-united-ponder-loan-move-for-midfielder","story":"Celtic are keeping tabs on Scott McTominays situation with Manchester United prepared for the midfielder to go out on a possible loan move before the closure of the transfer window.

to secure a fourth successive Premiership runners-up spot.“As a young player it is my responsibility to be ready to come on at any time the gaffer needs me,” he said.“I have just got to play well when I do get on and not worry about the situation.“I just have to play my own game and hopefully I come across as a player the manager trusts to play in all the games.”Articulate, polite, mature and clearly passionate about his home city club, Campbell is as impressive off the pitch as on it.He hopes his contribution in recent matches can earn him a crack at Stenhousemuir.Campbell said: “Hopefully I have done enough in the last three games I have played to get into the manager’s thoughts.“I came on against Hearts at a tough time in the game when it was still close and I did okay.“I also got myself a goal in the game against Livingston and got on the ball a lot.“Hopefully I have played enough to get myself in the manager’s thoughts for the Scottish Cup tie.”Such is McInnes’ faith in the teenager, the club snapped him up on an extended contract until summer  last September.Aberdeen called time on their United Arab Emirates’ camp with Sam Cosgrove scoring twice to beat FC Dibba Al-Hisn.Campbell impressed in that game but accepts he faces a battle to force his way into the first team.He said: “The game in Dubai was enjoyable but the most important thing was to get our legs and sharpness back before the Scottish Cup tie.“It was good to play with the boys again.“We scored a couple of good goals and kept a clean sheet so we were delighted with the game.“The squad is really strong this season so I am learning a lot from the players every day.“I am also fighting for my place in the squad each week and hopefully I can push on for the rest of the season and play as much as I can.”"},{"url":null,"title":"car overturns at aberdeen roundabout","story":"A car has overturned at an Aberdeen roundabout.The incident occurred around .am at the AWPR Parkhill roundabout at Dyce.A Police Scotland spokesman said: #A car has overturned on the roundabout.#It is due to the poor weather conditions.#"},{"url":null,"title":"cars stuck on north east road due to poor weather conditions","story":"A number of cars are stuck on a north-east road due to snowy conditions.Issues have been reported to police on the A at Fyvie.A total of six to eight cars are stuck on the road near to St Andrews Brae.A Police Scotland spokesman said: #A number of vehicles are stuck.#We have had four or five calls, all with people stuck on the hill.#Drivers are advised to avoid the area."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/01/dct_stock_police_accident_road_closed_crash_02-140x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"heres how to sign up for run garioch 2019","story":"Runners have been urged to snap up charity spots at a popular north-east race.Organisers of Run Garioch have announced its charity partners for the  race that takes place March .Thousands of runners are expected to take part in three separate races including a k, k and half marathon.Six charity partners have been announced today including the Friends of the Neonatal Unit, CLAN Cancer Support, Inspire, Gathimba Edwards Foundation, Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland and Charlie House.Each charity is given the same number of places to encourage people to raise funds.Christine Appel, race support manager for Run Garioch, said: “We opened our entries at Halloween.“We are now launching our charity partners so they can get entries for themselves to raise funds.“Run Garioch really relies on the charities for help – they man the water stations, bag drop and are marshals for the race.“Our six partner charities all have entries allocated to them andour public spaces were to sell out runners can do it through them instead.“We shut entries on February  and the charities have an extra two weeks to get entries after that.“We are ahead of schedule for sign-ups for this year’s race.

When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Invited to join Cameron up at the Cruachan dam for the second of his two recent programmes, I was delighted to tramp the mighty mountain with Scotland’s Number one authority on outdoor pursuits.As an author and broadcaster, Cameron always has an eye on a good story, and so as well as asking me about the lack of health and safety regulations at the time the hydro project was being built, he also wanted to knowthere really was a murder during the construction. There was, as I told him, a body – but the body wasn’t identied, no arrests were made, no court case took place.It would be a shamethat construction period went down in history as an invasion of , workmen – #Tunnel Tigers# as they were dubbed – into one of Argyll#s most beautul settings and a possible murder.My book was intended to give the story of the local people whose lives were punctuated by this ambitious construction project. Quite rightly, those Tunnel Tigers had been lauded in a number of publications. The work that was done hollowing out Argyll’s highest mountain to provide electricity for the nation was amazing.The plan for Cruachan – as for the other major hydro projects of the post World War II era – was conceived by Tom Johnston, to whom I dedicated my book. Johnston was a politician who remained true to his ideals of bringing rural Scotland into the modern world. There was no power in the Highlands, and without power there could be no industry and no prosperity. The engineering genius was Sir Edward MacColl, whose biographer Norrie Fraser called him #a maker of modern Scotland#.Cruachan was the first reversible pumped-storage system in the world. During its years of construction from  to , eminent international engineers visited the project to see how the water was pumped between two reservoirs through reversible turbine generators. At off-peak hours, the water was – is # pumped back up to the reservoir you see high up in the corrie above Loch Awe, held back by a dam that is now so much a part of our landscape. The loch itself is the lower reservoir.I had imagined that the scale of such a project – using Scotland’s top engineering companies who shipped in workers from other parts of the UK and Europe – would have been a cause for resentment and protest by local people.That, of course, failed to take account of the vision of the folk of Dalmally, Lochawe, and Taynuilt. Although it took men with engineering experience to blast the  miles of tunnels, hollow out the mountain itself, and construct the dam, there was also a need for a support army. There were clerks and porters, joiners and caterers, folk willing to let out a room, a caravan, a house, serve in a pub where just occasionally it was necessary to keep a baseball bat behind the bar to maintain bonhomie. The project kick started careers, fortunes and marriages, and gave the area good roads and a tourist industry.If you haven’t visited the hollow mountain or walked Cruachan’s slopes, make  the year you do.[In bold please] Cruachan: The Hollow Mountain is available from the Argyll Book Centre in Lochgilphead and all good book shops, along with Marian Pallister#s other books of local interest.PICS:The Pass of Brander before work started. no_aCruachanLe before the project # the Loch Awe Hotel with steamers. no_aCruachanThe Queen opening the project in October . no_aCruachanWorking on the  miles of tunnels. no_aCruachanWorking on the road to the dam, overlooking Loch Awe. no_aCruachan"},{"url":null,"title":"now ewe see him the mystery of tarberts rambling ram","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA four-legged Houdini running free around an Argyll fishing village has had local people flocking to social media channels.A rogue sheep # a maleof the Scottish blackface breed # was first spotted loose near Tarbert Golf Club around New Year#s Day.There followed a number of sightings around the Loch Fyne village of the scarlet-painted pimpernel, ranging from the harbour side to the Campbeltown road.He was even spotted near Tarbert Parish Church on Sunday January , though it is not clear whether he joined the flock.One Tarbert resident commented: #It#s like now ewe see him, now ewe don#t.#The woolly wanderer#s fun was curtailed early the following week when he was captured and taken to a nearby farm.As the tup sheepishly set off for more secure accommodation, it seemed the online jokers# fun was at an end # puns involving  #ewe#, #horns#, #mint sauce# and even some unfair references to certain football fans were all the rage on Facebook.But that was that, the sheep was gone.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13859701.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS171103908.jpg","title":"ayr united fans chance sleep","story":"NewsAyr United fans have chance to sleep on Somerset Park in homeless fundraiserThe fundraiser, being staged by Ayr United and homeless charity SeAscape, will be held under the lights at Somerset Park.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsAyr stars Robbie Crawford, Andy Murdoch, Craig Moore and Declan McDaid join Ky Kane of SeAscape \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyr United fans dream of playing on Somerset Park’s hallowed turf.

some people do find it dficult to get around and they would welcome additional support to make a day at the races an even better experience.ldquoI noticed that at the larger racecourses in England people could hire mobility scooters and I hope that Scottish courses can at least match this or go better and offer them free.\"I am delighted Bill Farnsworth had taken up this idea and I am sure the scooters will be very popular at Musselburgh.Awarded the MBE in  for her fundraising activities which has raised more than pound, for MS and the Injured Jockeys Fund, Rhona is a regular attendee at

how could a second referendum come about Holding a referendum requires an Act of Parliament. The most obvious way would be for the Government to table a simple stand-alone Bill, as was the case for the  referendum. However, Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear she is firmly opposed to the idea.An alternative route could be for MPs to try to amend another piece of relevant legislation.ndash How long would it take In the case of the  referendum, it took seven months to get the Bill through Parliament ndash although in practice it could be done much more quickly.The Electoral Commission then has a statutory duty to assess the referendum question to ensure it is intelligible and free from bias ndash a process which would normally take up to  weeks, although again it could be shortened.The legislation would specy theof the referendum campaign. All recent campaigns have lasted at least  weeks.Overall, the Institute for Government estimates the whole process could take up to five months.ndash What would that mean for the Brexit timetable On current plans, Britain is due to leave the EU on March , so it could not be completed by then.Therefore, for a referendum to be held, the Government would have to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to the Article  withdrawal process ndash something the EU may or may not grant.For a second referendum to be held, the Government would have to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to the Article  withdrawal process ndash What would be the question on the ballot paper This is where it gets complicated.Generally referendums offer a simple choice between two options ndash as in  when it was Leave or Remain. However, most MPs accept that there would have to be at least three options ndash leave with a deal, leave without a deal, or remain in the EU.ndash How would that work Various ideas have been floated.One would be for voters to rank the options in order of preference. If none of the options gained an overall majority of first preference votes, the one with the fewest votes would be eliminated and its second preference votes would be distributed among the other two.Alternatively, voters could just be given one choice. If none received an overall majority, the one with the fewest votes would again be eliminated, but under this scheme the other two options would then go forward to a final ballot a week later.A third way could be to have a two-question ballot. The first would askvoters wanted to Leave or Remain. The second would ask them to choose between a deal and a no-deal Brexit in the event that there is still a majority for Leave.A counter tallies ballot papers after the referendum on the UKrsquos membership of the EU in  ndash Where do the political parties stand The Conservatives officially oppose a second referendum, arguing that voters made their views clear in  and that another ballot would simply exacerbate the bitter isions opened up by the Brexit debate.However, a growing number of mainly Remain-supporting backbench Tory MPs are warming to the idea, believing it offers a way out of the current impasse.Labour says it wants a general election, butthat is not possible all options are on the table ndash including a second referendum.Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a longstanding Eurosceptic, has, however, shown little enthusiasm for the idea, while some of his supporters fear it could alienate traditional Labour voters in Leave-supporting areas.However, he is facing a groundswell of support from within the party for another vote, including from many of the young Momentum activists who propelled him to the leadership and who are passionately opposed to Brexit.Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP ndash which opposes Brexit ndash will back a second referendum in the Commons.Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP will back a second referendum ndash Are there any precedents for a second referendum In the UK, not really. However in other countries, where referendums are more common, there is a history of giving voters a chance to think again.In Ireland, for example, in  voters supported ratication of the EU Lisbon Treaty, having rejected it at the first time of asking.Similarly, in , the Irish voted for the Nice Treaty on the second occasion..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: How a second Brexit referendum might work"},{"url":null,"title":"the 21st centurys final teenage year","story":"Last year the rout of retail continued.

Scotland found a gap in the literacy and numeracy performance of children coming into P.The new school will follow a single curriculum anda single headteacher will be appointed to oversee its management.The decision to push ahead with the plans came despite a public consultation which found only  per cent of those who took part were in favour of the proposal, with  per cent against it.And it was revealed that while the parent council of the infant school was for the merger, the same body from the primary school had opposed it.Fiona Robertson, East Lothianrsquos head of education, said that following those results she had arranged to meet face to face with parents at public meetings in a bid to tackle their concerns.She said: ldquoIt is really important we work with the parental community and I took part in further meetings with parents because in their minds to say closure sounds like their school is going to be shut and there were concerns about operating over two sites.Mrs Robertson said that Helen Gillanders, headteacher of Dunbar Primary School, which operates over two sites, also attended meetings to discuss how her school operates.The merging of the two schools was supported by all four ward councillors at a meeting in Haddington.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader, said it was ldquothe most important decision we make\".He said: ldquoPupilsrsquo le chances are affected by their school experiences and both schools play a signicant role in this community.He acknowledged that there had been concerns from some parents but pointed to a recent inspection at Prestonpans Primary School which had called for additional support to be given to the school after grading its performance as weak in parts.He said: ldquoWe know we have and have had great teachers, inspiring headteachers and great support staff and yet we receive these reports.ldquoWe owe it to the children of Prestonpans to give them the best opportunities they can. I think in the long term it will be the best benefit for the people of Prestonpans.His view was given cross-party support at the council meeting, with fellow councillor Norman Hampshire saying that concerns about the merger were caused by ldquoa fear of the unknown.The new school is expected to be operational by February, with a Transition Action Group brought in to oversee any changes.Its name is still to be decided."},{"url":null,"title":"new-landlord-takes-over-at-the-prestoungrange-gothenburg","story":"Michelle Wilson began working at The Goth public house on Prestonpans High Street a couple of years ago and very quickly rose through the ranks to become the general manager, under Sean Woodrsquos leadership.Sean said: ldquoMichelle became very evidently a huge asset to the business soon after she started.ldquoShe clearly has the drive, ambition and passion to make the best out of anything she puts her hands to.ldquoThe businessrsquo entertainment programme has grown signicantly since Michelle took it on and we have become a true destination for those seeking out weekend entertainment.Sean will be moving on to spend more time on other ventures, while Michelle will take on the lease and roll out a plan of improvements and initiatives to take the establishment to the next level.Sean added: ldquoIrsquove done what I can here and itrsquos now time to pass the baton on to somebody  to take things forward and seek out new ways of enhancing what is on offer at The Goth, and I couldnrsquot think of anybody better than Michelle to do just that.ldquoIt seems such a natural transition.ldquoI have found it an absolute pleasure to serve the community during my tenure, having presided over seven weddings, numerous family occasions and events, and have a huge gratitude of praise for Michelle having stood by my side throughout this time.ldquoI wish her all the best for the future.The Goth has changed hands a few times over the  years it has been in existence, the most signicant of which was when Dr Gordon Prestoungrangersquos family purchased and refurbished the building in  they have retained ownership ever since.An attempt to encourage a community buyout two years ago did not come to fruition, at which point Sean took on the lease of the establishment, having been the resident brewer for a year.

We now look forward to the merriment of Hogmanay! These days in between, traditionally known as the Daft Days, are my favourite of Yule time.Yet not so long ago the most popular focus of festivity was neither Christmas nor even Hogmanay, it was Handsel Monday.It fell upon the first Monday after New Year, although there was some dispute as to the exact Monday it should be celebrated, for some measured the date by the old calendar.This was the case for the country folk in East Lothian, or Haddingtonshire as it was then known. So Auld Handsel Monday fell for them on the first Monday after January .It was the country folkrsquos winter holiday because Christmas and Yule festivities had for so long been banned by the Kirk.The word Handsel apparently comes from an old Saxon word which means to give by hand.On Handsel Monday the family gathered together and shared gts and social time, which for much of the th century remained the main winter festival of the rural poor in East Lothian.The East Lothian writer and poet James Lumsden captured the atmosphere of this now forgotten holiday in one of his poems about the day.He tells us the children would wake up all excited, and the merriment would begin as the dawn of this winterrsquos day heralded a special time of conviviality and reunion:ldquoBy screich o morn the bairns are up,\"And loud the auld folk rousin\"What braws are donnd, what sangs are connd,\"What daffin an carousin!\"It was a time when family members made huge efforts tohome and celebrate together. Food had been specially kept for the occasion and those at home awaited the arrival of others who they had perhaps not seen since the previous Handsel Monday.Lumsden says streams of young folk left the towns for their homes in the countryside. Domestic servants, shop assistants, apprentices all set off in the early hours on Handsel Monday ason a pilgrimage, to share in the celebrations:ldquoSune ran we hame wi anxious haste\"For our grand Hansel denner,\"Pork chops and dumplins ndash lord a feast ndash\"A gorge for saunt or sinner!We can picture the scene as daughters and sons ed, greeted by parents and younger siblings, grandparents and old friends. It was a time of gt giving, with family and neighbours sharing treats.But the rich were expected to give too, as it was the tradition that masters and employers would give gts of drink, food and even a financial contribution to the communityrsquos festivities. In fact, the social norms were often overturned on this day, with the landowners serving and working for the poor on this one special day.While it had no religious content, Handsel Monday was in its own way sacred. It was a longed for day off for those who worked hard with little in the way of holidays. It was Christmas Day, Boxing Day and Hogmanay all wrapped into one.And as the day wore into evening, the merriment would build. People made the most of this precious social time together, with stories, dance and song:ldquoSyne sune wi reels, an strathspeys even,\"The wee cot housie dirled,\"As a the blasts o yearth an heaven\"Were gainst its boukie hurled\"Braw lads and lasses lap and skirled.As is always the case with such gatherings, time flew and too soon the day would draw to a close:ldquoBut daffin jigs, an sangs, an tales,\"Sped far too swith the hours on.Sad farewells would have to be made. Mothers and fathers hugged tightly their grown children as they prepared to set off back to their employment. Old and new friends from near and far, who had come to share the day, parted to their duties.They would have to wait another year for the next Handsel Monday gathering. Who knows what fortune and fate would have in store before that time:ldquoFor freends were met whom morrows gales\"Wad waft apart les course on\"Anither year, and maybe neer\"Again while times flood roars on,\"Might they eer meet, or even greet,\"This fickly warls shores on,\"Tho here this day!And yet it was to be Handsel Monday itself whose fate was sealed, as it faded in importance compared to Hogmanay and its traditions of gt giving and family time overtaken by Christmas.It has became part of our Auld Lang Syne, yet its spirit is perhaps now spread over a thankfully longer time of winter festivity.Happy New Year, when it comes.With thanks to Electric Scotland website for the copy of the poem."},{"url":null,"title":"man-caused-disturbance-at-tranent-opticians","story":"Paul Donaghue behaved in a threatening manner and repeatedly shouted and swore at MontgomeryOptometrists on the townrsquos Bridge Street.Donaghue, of Main Street, then began throwing papers around the shop and refused to leave the premises when asked to do so by staff.The -year-old also stole a toy from the Tranent Paper Shop and a quantity of foodfrom a nearby Greggs shop.All the offences took place on November .Donaghue then told police officers his name was James Davidson in an attempt to evade arrest and he was prosecuted for perverting the course of justice.He also pleaded guilty to being in possession of a screwdriver on the same day.Donaghue appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court,where sentence was deferred for reports to next month."},{"url":null,"title":"unique-new-features-for-new-elphinstone-playpark","story":"Pupils at Elphinstone Primary School were given a choice of three potential options for a replacement playpark on the villagersquos Buxley Road.A vote was taken, with an option chosen to create a playpark with two features which will be unique to East Lothian.The first of those is made up of three D hexagon structures which have foot and hand-holds and are designed for climbing on.The second is a raised disc which youngsters can run on.The rest of the park is made up of familiar playpark favourites, including swings, a slide, seesaw, flying fox and climbing net.Elphinstone Community Association has been busy working with East Lothian Council on the project for nearly a year.Now they are hopeful the playpark, which it is estimated will cost about pound,, could be in place in the spring.Stuart MacKenzie, chairman of the villagersquos community association, said: ldquoI think it is fantastic.

And the world is an unfair place where those who have too much money and too many things keep it to themselves, so those who have too little money never get their fair share, even though there is sufficient for everyone to have enough.ldquoSo I want to be one of those that has too much! declared one member of the class, to laughter.ldquoAndso would you share what you have with others who do not have enough  asked the storyteller.The child paused for a moment for thought: ldquoMaybe some of it.Other children voiced dferent opinions. ldquoIrsquod keep it all, ldquoIrsquod share it, ldquoIrsquod give some to my family and friends.It created some discussion amongst the children.The teacher was going to ask the children to be quiet and listen to the storyteller, but he indicated he was happy with what was happening.ldquoBut then yoursquod end up being poor again, said one. ldquoNo, Irsquod not give it all away.ldquoBut the whole point of being rich is that you can do what you want.ldquoWell, it also means you can help other people.The storyteller listened to the debate for a minute or two, then he beat his drum to regain the childrenrsquos attention.ldquoAnd so, for most here, money will be your dream. I understand that. Nobody wants to be poor. But lots of money is not really your dream.A chorus of: ldquoYes it is!ldquoNo, replied the storyteller, ldquomoney is not your dream, it is what you spend it on, what it might make possible for you that you do not have now, that would be your dream. That is what you must think of before you set out on your quest.ldquoBecauseyou pick the apple of your dreams, but have no dreams for your le, then you will still be poor, evenyou have all the money in the world.ldquoThatrsquos just stupid, said one boy. The teacher was quick to remind him not to be rude, but the storyteller asked him: ldquoWhat is stupid ldquoWhat yoursquove just said, you canrsquot be pooryou are rich, that doesnrsquot make sense. Thatrsquos what I meant is stupid.The storyteller smiled. ldquoPerhaps you are right, but do you think sometimes people can also be poor in things that money canrsquot buy There was silence for a moment. Then a girl said: ldquoYou mean people can be poor in dreams for their le The storyteller smiled and nodded.ldquoPrecisely, said the storyteller. ldquoThe whole issue of getting rich has stopped us thinking about what our dreams actually are.ldquoI want to be a dancer, said one child. ldquoI want to drive fast cars, said another.ldquoI still want to be rich so I donrsquot have to do anything and just play computer games.ldquoI want to make the computer games, said his friend. ldquoYeah, me too, agreed his pal.ldquoI want to be the President! another said.ldquoI just want to be happy!The storyteller beat his drum again.ldquoAnd so before you set off on your quest you must think about your dreams. And let me tell you that dreams can be shared too.ldquoHowrsquod you do that  he was asked.The storyteller thought for a moment: ldquoWell, for some their dream may be to save an animal that is in danger of being extinct.ldquoOr save the planet, called out another.ldquoThatrsquos why I want to be President.ldquoSo I want you to think about your dreams, and once you have you got your dreams you are ready for your quest into the forest, said the storyteller.The children assembled their thoughts and soon everyone had a collection of dreams to take with them to the apple tree.ldquoThere is one more thing I forgot to tell you, said the storyteller. ldquoItrsquos an important piece of information. You see, when you finally get to the clearing you must be very careful, for wrapped around the base of the ancient apple tree there is a ferocious dragon.ldquoIt sleeps, but very lightly. It will wake when you approach the tree. It will hear you no matter how quiet. It will hear your heartbeat. And there is no place to hide in the clearing. The moment you approach the tree, the dragon will pounce on you.ldquoCan the dragon fly  asked one.ldquoYes.ldquoAnd breathe fire ldquoYes.There were murmurings.ldquoAnd so, the storyteller continued, ldquoyou must decide how you will overcome and defeat the dragon. It is there to stop you reaching the apple of your dreams.Some of the children came up with immediate ideas:ldquoIrsquod run as fast as I could in zig zags.ldquoIrsquod distract the dragon.ldquoIrsquod shoot the dragon with a gun.ldquoIrsquod make a giant kite and fly to the apple.ldquoIrsquod take some friends and feed them to the dragon while I get the apple, then dream my friends back again.There were many solutions and the storyteller listened to them with interest. Each child came up with a dferent strategy.The storyteller nodded, explaining the powers of the dragon that it couldnrsquot be killed by bullets or blades or fire, that it was faster than lightning and once it had heard you and seen you it would go for you.ldquoKnowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams They all said yes, refining their ideas.And so once the children had come up with their final strategy, the storyteller asked them to think about what they might need to take with them to defeat the dragon. They will have to carry these things through the forest, or perhaps collect them on the way.Then the storyteller set the children the task of drawing the things they would need and then the dragon and apple tree. In drawing the apple they would have to decide what the apple of their dreams would look like.When this was all done, the children settled down to hear who had the right answer.ldquoI have looked at all the ideas, said the storyteller. ldquoWhat I must say is that le is unfair and so is this quest. For some, the journey through the forest will be longer than others. The dragon will be more dficult to defeat for some than others, as its mood changes. But you have all come up with the same answer, and so you are all right.There were howls of protest.ldquoNo, we didnrsquot we all have dferent answers!The storyteller beat his drum again to calm the children.ldquoWell yes, you all have dferent ideas on how to defeat the dragon and reach the apple, that is true. But you all have the same answer to the most important question.ldquoWhatrsquos that  the children asked.ldquoWell, said the storyteller, ldquoI had told you how fierce and dreadful the dragon could be. And then I asked youknowing all this, are you still going to try and defeat the dragon and reach the apple of your dreams.ldquoAnd you all said yes, yoursquod try to reach your dreams, even though you had a big fight on your hands.ldquoThat, I believe, is the right answer. You may have dferent ideas on how to get that apple, but yoursquore all right because each of you will have to fight the dragon in a dferent way. The most important thing is your determination to get to that apple.ldquoWhatafter all that we fail  asked one child.ldquoYou might, said the storyteller, ldquobut on your journey to your dreams you may find a new path that leads to another ancient tree without a dragon.ldquoTherersquos another magic apple tree without a dragon !ldquoPerhaps, perhaps not. But the only way to find out is set off on the journey with determination in your heart. You might realise on the journey that your dreams are easier to reach than you had thought, or it could be the other way round.ldquoBut the most important thing is to have your dreams and find ways to reach them.The storyteller finished his session. He left the children with their dreams and their strategy to reach them.Happy New Year and good luck in defeating your dragon, and reaching your apple."},{"url":null,"title":"salon-owner-astonished-as-sign-to-be-torn-down","story":"Anna Mather moved her business from grade C listed premises in Gford into a grade B listed building on Haddington High Street last year.The switch has allowed her successful hair stylist team, who were named Scotlandrsquos Hair and Beauty Salon of the Year, to take on larger premises as they moved into the converted George Hotel building in the centre of town.But Ms Mather was stunned when East Lothian Council planners wrote to her to say that her shop sign, which is the same as the one she had at Gford, would be forcibly removed in a few weeksrsquo time.Ms Mather said: ldquoI contacted planners about the sign when we moved in and was told that, because it is plastic, it is the wrong material for the building, even though the shops across the road use the same type of signs.ldquoWe had gone to great s to ensure it was mounted properly to avoid having to screw it into the wall of the building and it is the same as we had at our previous salon.ldquoI appreciate it is a grade B listed building and am happy to meet requirements but when I asked for advice about what materials I could use they said they could not tell me.ldquoI have to apply for planning permission but, without knowing the material I can use, it will just be rejected and cost us money.ldquoNow they have written to say they are coming to forcibly remove the sign on January  and will charge us for the work.ldquoWe are a new business in the town and cannot afford to have these types of expensive bills.

And so I think I shall.A story from your head is a term I use to describe a story either made up on the spot or a remembered story that was made up at an earlier time. So essentially itrsquos a story that isnrsquot written down anywhere or got from a book.Of course, reading to, and with, children is really important. But making stories together with a child is a really bonding experience and a fantastic way to encourage the child to explore and develop her or his creative imagination.This dadrsquos child is quite young but the process Irsquom about to describe can be used for any age group, and indeed yourself.Firstly, I want you to think of a mountain. You are standing at its base on one side and you want to get to the other side. In order to do so you will need to climb to the summit first. This mountain in your imagination is going to initially help you make a story, because itrsquos called a story mountain.So now you are standing at the base of the story mountain. You need a few things before you begin your journey to the summit, and the first thing is a character or characters.This is the first question to ask your child: who is in the story  Let them decide, and it can be anyone or anything: a dragon, a princess, a footballer, Spiderman, a Minion, a witch, a boy or girl, or even your child themselves.Next question is to find which place the story begins, that is what the setting is for the beginning of the tale. So you can ask where the character is.It can be an imaginary setting or a real one, perhaps even local, itrsquos up to the child for example, answers might include ldquothe dragon is hiding in a school or ldquothe princess lives in a cave.Once you have a character or characters and some kind of setting you have the beginning of the story. ldquoOnce upon a time, a dragon was hiding in a schoolhellip ldquoThere was once a princess who lived in a cavehellipYou can now help the child to add a few detailsyou wish by asking simple questions about the characters and or the settings. For example: ldquoWhy is the dragon hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the cave look like Questions like these can help direct the story towards what is going to happen, and that is the next part of your journey up the slope to the summit of your story mountain.So the child may say: ldquoThe dragon is hiding in the school because itrsquos scared of a bigger dragon. Or: ldquoThe cave is cold.Now we have the characters and setting, itrsquos time to make the climb to the summit of the story mountain. This climb represents the issue within the story: a problem, a task or quest, a desire or dream to be sought, a need for change or something to be found and so on. In other words, itrsquos the beginning of the adventure.Itrsquos at this point that beginning the process of visualisation is useful. Visualisation is a technique used by storytellers to help them remember a tale and tell it in their own words. It involves actually imagining yourself in the story, asyou are there.So before you set off on the story, imagine the dragon in the school, enter into the image in your head. Is it your old school, what does the dragon look like, where in the school is it hiding, what are its emotions Likewise with the princess, can you see her in the cave  Enter it in your imagination and look around. Is it large or small, cosy or scary  Where does she sleep and can you see the princess shivering in the cold  What is she feeling and thinking This is what story is all about, entering the world of imagination. Itrsquos not the words you need to remember but the images in your mind. Itrsquos like they become a memory which you can later describe.Your child will have his or her own visualisations, but you can help develop that by asking questions and allowing the child to describe what he or she sees.Painting vivid moving pictures in your mindrsquos eye is the key to not only remembering but developing the story.So now we may have a terried small dragon hiding in the dinner hall of your childrsquos school, and a shivering princess sitting by a small campfire in a huge cave, feeling hungry.The next step is to find out what is going to happen. This begins us on the journey to the summit of the story mountain. To give the child ownership of the story, ask him or her questions like: ldquoSo does the big dragon find the one hiding in the school  Or: ldquoWhat does the princess do to make the cave warmer and get something to eat Now we have the issue that takes us up the hill to the summit. The summit represents the transformative moment in the story, the thing or person or happening that alters the course of events. In any story, this is an important ingredient.So perhaps we will end up with: ldquoThe big dragon flies into the playground and all the children run. But the teacher comes out and is really strict and makes it go away so the children are safe, and so is the wee dragon. Or: ldquoThe princess goes fishing. And she sees a pirate ship while shersquos fishing and decides she wants to be a pirate instead.So the headteacher and the pirate ship are the transformative factors in these examples. They change the course of the story, and in doing so the journey back down the other side of the mountain can now take place, for this represents the conclusion or ending of the tale.Is it a happy, sad, funny ending  So questions like ldquowhat happens to the wee dragon  and ldquodoes the princess enjoy being a pirate and living on the pirate ship  may lead to answers that the wee dragon loves the school and becomes a part of the P class and learns to read, and that the princess becomes the pirate captain.So now the base of the other side of the mountain has been reached, with the storyrsquos ending. Now you can take away the structure of the mountain and lay down the bones of the story you have made along the journey.Here are the bones: wee dragon hides in a school from a bigger dragon, teacher chases bigger dragon away, wee dragon decides he likes the school and stays and joins P princess is in cave cold and hungry, she goes fishing by the sea and sees a pirate ship, she joins the pirate crew and becomes the captain.The visualisation technique can now be used to put flesh on the bones, giving it more detail. You can revisit the tale and develop it later, or leave it as it is.In telling the story, donrsquot think of words, think of the images created in your head, then the words will come naturally as you describe what you see.This way you will remember the story.

The most obvious way would be for the Government to table a simple stand-alone Bill, as was the case for the  referendum. However, Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear she is firmly opposed to the idea.An alternative route could be for MPs to try to amend another piece of relevant legislation.ndash How long would it take In the case of the  referendum, it took seven months to get the Bill through Parliament ndash although in practice it could be done much more quickly.The Electoral Commission then has a statutory duty to assess the referendum question to ensure it is intelligible and free from bias ndash a process which would normally take up to  weeks, although again it could be shortened.The legislation would specy theof the referendum campaign. All recent campaigns have lasted at least  weeks.Overall, the Institute for Government estimates the whole process could take up to five months.ndash What would that mean for the Brexit timetable On current plans, Britain is due to leave the EU on March , so it could not be completed by then.Therefore, for a referendum to be held, the Government would have to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to the Article  withdrawal process ndash something the EU may or may not grant.ndash What would be the question on the ballot paper This is where it gets complicated.Generally referendums offer a simple choice between two options ndash as in  when it was Leave or Remain. However, most MPs accept that there would have to be at least three options ndash leave with a deal, leave without a deal, or remain in the EU.ndash How would that work Various ideas have been floated.One would be for voters to rank the options in order of preference. If none of the options gained an overall majority of first preference votes, the one with the fewest votes would be eliminated and its second preference votes would be distributed among the other two.Alternatively, voters could just be given one choice. If none received an overall majority, the one with the fewest votes would again be eliminated, but under this scheme the other two options would then go forward to a final ballot a week later.A third way could be to have a two-question ballot. The first would askvoters wanted to Leave or Remain. The second would ask them to choose between a deal and a no-deal Brexit in the event that there is still a majority for Leave.ndash Where do the political parties stand The Conservatives officially oppose a second referendum, arguing that voters made their views clear in  and that another ballot would simply exacerbate the bitter isions opened up by the Brexit debate.However, a growing number of mainly Remain-supporting backbench Tory MPs are warming to the idea, believing it offers a way out of the current impasse.Labour says it wants a general election, butthat is not possible all options are on the table ndash including a second referendum.Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a longstanding Eurosceptic, has, however, shown little enthusiasm for the idea, while some of his supporters fear it could alienate traditional Labour voters in Leave-supporting areas.However, he is facing a groundswell of support from within the party for another vote, including from many of the young Momentum activists who propelled him to the leadership and who are passionately opposed to Brexit.Scotlandrsquos First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP ndash which opposes Brexit ndash will back a second referendum in the Commons.ndash Are there any precedents for a second referendum In the UK, not really. However in other countries, where referendums are more common, there is a history of giving voters a chance to think again.In Ireland, for example, in  voters supported ratication of the EU Lisbon Treaty, having rejected it at the first time of asking.Similarly, in , the Irish voted for the Nice Treaty on the second occasion."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/9091691.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"jobs-boost-for-larkhall-as-council-gives-green-light-for-new-lidl-store","story":"The new supermarket will be built on the townrsquos Carlisle Road.The supermarket first revealed in January  that it wanted to open a new store at the site of the closed Sefton Park Care Home as part of its ongoing expansion in the UK.Construction is estimated to start on site in the spring with a view to open the store in .The multi million-pound investment will see Lidl build a sustainable store with msup sales area with plans to create up to  new jobs.The supermarket will feature facilities including an instore bakery, customer toilets and ldquoample parking for both cars and bicycles.Lidl UKrsquos regional head of property, Gordon Rafferty, said: ldquoWe could not be more delighted to have received planning permission, and look forward to getting started on construction.ldquoIrsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the local community for their continued support, and very much look forward to opening our doors and offering our fresh, quality, great value products in the not too distant future.Lidl has experienced continued growth in Scotland over the years as more and more cost-conscious consumers flock to budget supermarkets.The refurbishment of the Larkhall store will add to Lidlrsquos existing store portfolio In the UK of , and will form part of the companyrsquos growth plans, which will see it open to  new stores a year across the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-the-snp-needs-to-face-up-to-the-political-reality-of-disunity","story":"The Salmond affair has collided with a dispute in the party about the future of independence. Mr Salmond has made no secret of his enthusiasm for an early referendum, and made clear last spring that he intended toto active politics to help lead it. Not everyone in the Scottish Government was entirely relaxed about this prospect.The First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has been intensely cautious about any future referendum, not least because of her failed attempt to launch one in . But many activists are instinctively with Mr Salmond, and believe a historic opportunity could be lost. The issue has been rumbling in the undergrowth since October when Ms Sturgeon once again delayed her long-promised timetable for indyref. She said shersquod deliver it when the fog of Brexit had cleared ndash but many in the party, even her strongest supporters, are giving up hope that there will be a referendum before the current mandate expires in .:Nicola Sturgeon facing second inquiry over Alex Salmond as feud worsensLast week, the First Minister yet again promised a statement on the referendum timetable, but that was overtaken by the Scottish Governmentrsquos defeat in court, when it admitted it had acted unlawfully and unfairly over the Salmond inquiry. Now, the prospects of any announcement this year must be close to zero.Ms Sturgeon has referred herself to parliamentrsquos standards , which could take three months to report. Parliament also agreed a special committee to investigate her series of private meetings with Mr Salmond. The  will probably exonerate her from any serious violation of the ministerial code. Therersquos nothing in the rules that says the First Minister canrsquot speak to her predecessor, though it is likely to say there should have been a written record of any meeting in which her chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, was present.But this will not be the end of the matter. There is also a criminal investigation by the Information Commissioner into the leaks of the Salmond ldquosex pest allegations to the Daily Record, which could be highly damaging. The journalists will of course protect their sources. Ms Sturgeon, on behalf of the Scottish Government, will deny all knowledge of a leak. But there will be a wealth of speculation and a running commentary from both sides.Already, wersquove had Ms Sturgeonrsquos spokespeople accusing ldquoTeam Salmond of ldquosmearing her. This is the first time I can recall such a serious accusation being made between such senior SNP figures in public. Mr Salmond claims that Ms Lloyd made contact with him in March, before he was informed of the allegations against him, and advised him not toto active politics. Ms Sturgeon denies that her chief of staff had prior knowledge of the specic complaints, though she concedes that Mr Salmondrsquos future had been discussed ldquoin the context of #metoo ndash which rather suggests that he was being warned off.Read More: Sturgeon accuses Team SalmondThis takes us into another ongoing aspect of this case: the presumption of innocence. The First Ministerrsquos many supporters on social media have been condemning Mr Salmond for making le more dficult for the ldquocourageous women, as the Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard described the civil service employees who made the complaints. This public speculation about Mr Salmondrsquos presumed guilt actually does no service to those women. As the former President of the Scottish Law Society, Ian Smart ndash a long-term critic of Mr Salmond ndash pointed out this week, such prejudicial commentary could undermine prospects for a successful prosecution. ldquoIfthis matter should ever proceed criminally, he wrote, ldquothese are remarks upon which any competent defence team will undoubtedly seize.The police have been examining Mr Salmondrsquos conduct over recent years and questioning employees and colleagues of the former First Minister to establish whether there is any evidence of similar sexual harassment. This is standard practice in such cases. But it is dficult for details of an investigation into such a high-profile figure as Mr Salmond not to leak into the public domain.No one knows whether Mr Salmond will be found to be innocent, I certainly have no wish to speculate on this. But many of his supporters believe that the most likely outcome is that the police will find insufficient evidence for a criminal prosecution. This could be the worst of both worlds for the SNP, because some would declare Mr Salmond guilty by default, others would condemn the Scottish Government for investigating him in the first place, and for making the allegations public.Whatever happens, Mr Salmond has made clear he will claim damages from the Scottish Government, which will rack up the already-substantial legal bill being paid by the taxpayer. That will renew the attack on Ms Sturgeonrsquos handling of the affair. Opposition parties may eventually support the call from the former SNP minister, Alex Neill, this week for a full judge-led inquiry into the procedures and practices of the Scottish Government that led to last weekrsquos Court of Session fiasco.So, this story could run and run ndash but will it destroy the SNP Government  I doubt it. In the end, Ms Sturgeon is not directly implicated in the mishandling of the Salmond inquisition ndash that was her civil servants. Moreover, Brexit and the aftermath to last nightrsquos vote will dominate politics for the next year. Scottish voters are quite capable of looking beyond questions about Mr Salmondrsquos personal conduct to the bigger issues.However, a bit of ision right now might be no bad thing. The SNP is far too averse to controversy, and it is about time it had a proper debate about its future and its leadership structures. Making a fetish of unity, and ignoring political reality, is almost as dangerous as a split."},{"url":null,"title":"how-did-european-media-react-to-crucial-brexit-vote","story":"In France Le Monde says Mrs May was subject to a \"humiliating defeat\" that left the future of her Government and Brexit \"more uncertain than ever\".The Prime Ministers loss is on the front page of El Pais in Spain, which says the \"crushing defeat\" make the \"crisis\" over Brexit worse.: Brexit crisis just got much deeper ndash who,anyone, will take control In Germany Der Spiegel says Mrs Mays Brexit plan has been \"shattered\" and asks: \"Must she go now \" - while a commentator for Bild describes the situation as \"Brexshit\".In Belgium LEchos headline reads \"The shadow of a hard Brexit\", while La Libre Belgique mulls \"the jump into the void of the British parliament\".The Brexit vote is also on the front of two papers in Sweden, the Svenska Dagbladet, which leads with Mrs Mays \"historic loss\", and the Dagens Nyheter, which says: \"After the historic setback - Mays fate can be decided today.\"In Denmark the national Jyllands-Posten leads with the \"big defeat for May\", saying it leaves Brexit facing \"maximum insecurity\".:Theresa Mays Brexit deal suffers historic Commons defeatDescribing the loss as a \"humiliating defeat\" that has \"thrust Britain further into political chaos\", the New York Times picks up on Mrs Mays warning before the vote that the decision will \"set the future of our country for generations\".The paper says: \"Like most others, though, the prime minister had no easy answers about the way forward.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8272383.jpg?type=article-full","title":"labour-mps-sign-letter-backing-second-eu-referendum","story":"The MPs said they backed leader Jeremy Corbyns tabling of a no-confidence motion in the hope of forcing an early general election, but saidthis did not succeed the party should \"unequivocally\" back a public vote.The move intensies pressure on Mr Corbyn to move quickly, after senior Labour figures indicated that the party was ready to table repeated no-confidence challenges to Mrs MayWednesdays vote does not succeed in ousting her.A motion passed at the partys conference last autumn made clear that a general election is Labours priority, but stated thatthis was not possible, the party would \"support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\".Senior backbencher Louise Ellman told the Press Association that Mr Corbyn should act \"immediately\" to throw Labours weight behind a second referendumWednesdays vote failed.\"Weve got the no-confidence motion today,\" said the Liverpool Riverside MP. \"If that doesnt carry, Jeremy should immediately call for a second referendum and start taking the moves to make that happen.\"We shouldnt have any further delay.

Conservative MPs turned out in force to block an attempt to throw the Tories out of office and call a general election.The  Democratic Unionist MPs joined with their minority Government allies together with Lady Sylvia Hermon, the Independent MP for North Down, to defeat the Labour motion by  votes to  a majority .The full number of Labour MPs available to vote -  - supported the motion along with the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and four independents.Earlier in the day, Ms Sturgeon was at Westminster to meet SNP colleagues for discussions on the partyrsquos strategy ahead.Having spoken to Mrs May the night before, the FM said she did not appear ldquoopen to new thinking.Speaking to reporters, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoThe PMrsquos position sounds asshe is deluding herself about what is possible in the next  days that hasnrsquot been possible in the last two and a half years.ldquoIt is time for everyone to get real, the country is facing a Brexit clf-edge, we cant carry on limping towards it oblivious to the reality.The FM denied the Salmond row had knocked back her expected announcement on a call for a second independence referendum, declaring: ldquoNot in the slightest, no, and explaining that she would make an announcement on the matter in the ldquonext matter of weeks.She added the Brexit crisis, ldquothe biggest in our letimes, made people in Scotland think thatthey were in charge of their affairs, ldquowe would perhaps be steering a better course right now we are in this position because we not independent.After a six-hour debate in the Commons, Tory MPs roared their approval when the vote numbers were read out.Mrs May responded to the result by making the invitation to the leaders of opposition parties, vowing to deliver on the \"solemn promise\" to deliver Brexit.During the debate, Mr Corbyn urged Mrs Mays \"zombie Government\" to make way and declared her \"Frankenstein\" Brexit deal was officially dead.He attacked Mrs May for presiding over \"the largest defeat in the history of our democracy\" on her Brexit deal and criticised the Governments record on issues beyond leaving the EU.But the Labour faced Tory taunts with former minister Anna Soubry labelling him the \"most hopeless Leader of the Opposition weve ever had\".The PM rose to cheers and the stamping of feet from her backbenchers and told Mr Corbyn a general election would be \"the worst thing we could do\".She said: \"It would deepen ision when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward, so this House should reject this motion.\"At this crucial moment in our nations history, a general election is simply not in the national interest.\"Mrs May also launched a personal attack on Mr Corbyn, noting: ldquoWhat he has done to his party is a national tragedy. What he would do to our country would be a national calamity."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-its-time-to-put-the-question-of-europe-to-people-again","story":"The overwhelming vote to Remain, repeated votes in the Scottish Parliament, and the compromise option of Single Market and Customs Union membership put forward by the Scottish Government have all been ignored.In being shut out of the process, we are not, however, alone. Right from the very start, when the decision to hold an EU referendum was made, this Brexit project has been all about seeking - and failing - to placate the feuding factions of the Tory party. Nothing  has mattered, certainly not the jobs or livelihoods of people in Scotland or the UK.:Herald poll: Scotland should have independence referendum after BrexitThere has been no attempt to bring people together to seek consensus, despite a clear commitment to do so, or to recognise the narrow nature of the Leave vote across the UK, let alone the  per cent Remain vote in Scotland.The sheer scale of the Prime Ministerrsquos historic defeat does not seem to have registered with her but the nature of that loss means the whole approach of the UK Government has to change. I, and the new First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, have asked for an urgent meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee.But more importantly there needs to be a fundamental re-think of the way the UK Government does business. Rather than being in the lecturing business, the Prime Minister needs to be in the listening business. Instead of seeking to bulldoze through unacceptable proposals she has to take on board the views of others.There is no prospect whatsoever of the Prime Ministerrsquos current deal being passed at the second attempt. That deal would make us poorer, it would drag Scotland out of not just the EU but the Customs Union and Single Market - which is eight times the size of the UK alone - hitting jobs and living standards.It would put us at a competitive disadvantage compared with Northern Ireland and it would almost certainly lead to a fall in Scotlandrsquos working population because of the Prime Ministerrsquos anti-immigration obsession. It would mean years of further damaging uncertainty as a vague political declaration will only provide more fuel for the internal disagreements within the Government.:David Mundell faces fresh calls to resign over Brexit voteTherefore a proper plan is needed. In the discussions the Prime Minister says she wants to have with other parties, and the devolved governments, we will be making it clear what we believe needs to happen.The first step that must be taken is to rule out No Deal. This outcome, so beloved of the hard Brexiteers in the Tory Party, must be taken off the table. Disgracefully the threat of No Deal has been used by the Prime Minister in an attempt to force MPs to accept her deal. That threat must now be removed.The second step is to stop the clock on Brexit. The Prime Minister still seems unable to face up the urgency of the situation with the UK due to leave the EU in less than three monthsrsquo time.So Theresa May must immediately write to the EU asking to extend the Article  process and take the steps provided for in the EU Withdrawal Act to remove March  as the date for the UKrsquos exit. An extension would require the unanimous support of the EU  which means there is no more time to waste.And thirdly, now that the Prime Minister has limped through a vote of no confidence, with a general election unlikely, legislation must also be brought forward to hold a second referendum on EU membership with the option for Remain on the ballot paper.A second referendum would not guarantee that Scotlandrsquos wishes will prevail, although SNP members would seek to amend any legislation with a ldquofour-nation lock so that the UK could only leave with the agreement of all the UKrsquos nations.The only way to ensure that democratic guarantee, of course, is for Scotland to be an independent country.One of the most instructive and revealing aspects of the period since the Brexit vote is the contrast between the way Ireland has been treated by the EU and the contempt with which Scotland has treated by the Westminster government.Ireland has received solidarity and support from all its EU partners, while our national interests are ignored, the powers of the Scottish Parliament are eroded and we are left at the mercy of an increasingly dysal and chaotic Westminster system.Indeed the costs to Scotland of not being independent have never been clearer.But whatever Scotlandrsquos constitutional future, it will be in all our interests for the UK to have the closest possible relationship with Europe, and it is time to put the question of EU membership to the people again.Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of Scotland and leader of the SNP"},{"url":null,"title":"ive-now-being-seen-as-james-nesbitts-delusional-cold-feet-character","story":"I could reveal more of the comments that question my sanity, integrity and talent this past week, as a result of the column \"Do women lose their sexuality at  \" But the point to mentioning the social media sandblasting is to say I canrsquot really be too upset when Annie Brown of the Record cites my cellulite, or when Radio Three music journalist and Herald contributor Kate Molleson labels me a misogynist.For two reasons the first is this week sees the Scottish Law Commissionrsquos recommendations on defamation law being debated, the Government hoping to ensure a balance between freedom of expression and the protection of an inidualrsquos reputation.

He will be  next month but still visits schools and other groups to give slideshow presentations about his war experiences. Here we reproduce an interview with Don which was published in the Groat in June  to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Don flew to Normandy twice on D-Day, first dropping paratroops and then a glider with more troops and equipment.*WHEN the grey dawn broke over Normandy on June , , Don Mason had already made the first of his two contributions to the momentous events of D-Day. The young airman was part of the six-man crew of a modied Stirling bomber that had dropped  paratroops and their equipment at Ranville under cover of darkness. Heading for home, the Stirling came under fire from anti-aircraft guns on the French coast but ed unscathed to its base at Fairford in Gloucestershire. In the early evening the same crew were back over Normandy, this time towing a glider with more troops destined for the original dropping zone ndash and by this stage, almost  hours after the start of the Allies seaborne invasion, the full enormity of Operation Overlord was clear to see. \"It looked like a scene out of a nightmare,\" Don now recalls.Don had been fascinated with aeroplanes since his childhood in Worcestershire. As a young boy he once walked four miles with his family to see a travelling circus which featured a plane of Great War vintage Don could only gaze in wonderment as the flying machine entertained the crowds, and he resolved that one day he would fly an aircraft of his own. It was an ambition that would be fulfilled with the onset of World War Two.Although just  at the time of D-Day, Don had already clocked up numerous operations as a bomber pilot. He had been severely injured in a fighter attack over Germany in  and was declared medically unfit. After being reinstated on appeal, he was retrained as a radio observer.\"We had been in No.  Group Bomber Command,\" says Don, who moved to Thurso in the s but whose Caithness connection goes back to  when he flew Blenheims out of Wick. \"The whole squadron were suddenly lted out of Bomber Command and put into  Group, airborne support, which was a completely new role because wed never worked with paratroops or the like before.\"He was now in  Squadron, flying a modied version of the Stirling four-engined heavy bomber: the Mk IV troop-carrier and glider tug. \"We had to do a lot of exercises to get used to that aeroplane and to get used to dropping troops and towing gliders, which obviously was a dferent ball game altogether... it required a lot of dferent techniques.\"And it was necessary with any airborne group to drop them accurately in as tight a bunch as possible ndash therefore youd got to operate at a low height and also not get them scattered, so timing was important.\"There developed a formation flying technique which was called starboard echelon, so youve got two lines of aircraft flying parallel to one another. We had to practise these on group exercises, and a number of things happened: tow ropes broke, gliders went down in dferent places.\"On one group exercise we were flying along in this starboard echelon formation and there were literally hundreds of us ndash it wasnt just my squadron, it was a number of dferent squadrons ndash and suddenly an aircraft in the port line veered straight across into an aircraft in the starboard line and they both went down in flames. We lost two aircraft and two crews, just like that, on an exercise. Those are the things that stick in the mind.\"That tragic accident occurred on May , , in one of the last group exercises before D-Day. It was becoming clear that a big operation was imminent, one that would have major repercussions for the course of the war.\"Obviously we knew something was happening,\" Don says, \"because we were practising with troops and gliders and whatever. But we werent aware, of course, until the th of June when we were briefed originally.\"The invasion was scheduled initially for June  but was postponed for  hours because of the weather. \"Before that we had the indications of the airfield being closed off and we werent allowed to leave ndash we were shut in, the mail was censored.\"Paratroops of the th Airborne Division had been arriving at Fairford from the middle of May, and glider pilots were gathering there too as the security arrangements became ever tighter. The troops camped out on the airfield and Don remembers: \"One thing that struck me was that most of them were not very big men but the amount of equipment they carried was phenomenal, with kitbags full of gear strapped to their legs. The other thing that struck me as quite remarkable was they were all carrying water bottles full of white rum!\"Stirling LJ  took off from Fairford at . hours on June  in what was code-named Operation Tonga, with Don as wireless operator air gunner. On board were  fully equipped paratroops and the BBC correspondent Guy Byam.Dons chief recollection of that night flight over the English Channel is the sight of vast numbers of landing craft and other vessels in the assembly area ndash which was known as \"Piccadilly Circus\" ndash as they awaited the signal to head for the beaches.\"We were briefed to drop precisely at a time and place,\" he explains. \"It was important to get the troops on the ground in a bunch, not scattered. We were only over mid-Channel so we did an orbit ndash that was a bit dicey with so many aircraft about, all flying in one direction, and us crossing the stream. It all went to build up the tension.\"Finally, at . hours, the troops were released at Ranville, where they were to set up a homing beacon to aid following aircraft and also to assist in holding bridges over the nearby river Orne after the seaborne invasion had begun. Don remembers the red light in the fuselage turning to green on reaching the dropping zone. \"They all had to go together. Naturally some hesitated on the lip of the door ndash but they had all got to go.\"In the lead-up to the drop, there had been a close encounter between the Stirling and a group of paratroops released by a nearby Dakota. \"He released his troops and they came past us and we flew right through and didnt touch one,\" says Don.\"There was no flak at all over Normandy but then we had to fly in a northerly direction towards the Pas de Calais after dropping our troops, which was a feint because the Germans expected us to attack the Pas de Calais rather than anywhere . So we flew on a northerly track and we experienced flak around Le Havre and Dieppe, and then when we exited France towards Beachy Head we got some light flak on the coast, but there wasnt a great deal of resistance.\"It was a dferent matter altogether when Don and his crew-mates embarked on their second operation of D-Day, code-named Mallard.This time their Stirling had a Horsa glider in tow, containing more troops bound for the Ranville area along with an armoured jeep, four anti-tank guns and ammunition. Take-off time was . hours and the glider was to be released at ..Don remembers the scene vividly: \"The Channel was still littered with shipping but when we approached the Normandy coast it was a chaotic mass of ships and landing craft and smoke and explosions. It looked like a scene out of a nightmare, really. And, of course, as we went over land and approached the landing zone there was a lot more activity and a lot more flak.\"You couldnt tow a glider above  knots so it was fairly slow. You were low because you didnt want the glider to be shot down before it could get down to land. So obviously a big aircraft like the Stirling, with a ft wingspan or thereabouts, and a Horsa glider behind it, was a good target. In fact, all  of our aircraft were hit by anti-aircraft fire.\"Indeed one of those planes was shot down and crash-landed into the beachhead. The airmen were uninjured and got away for a while before being picked up by a German patrol.Subsequently the German position where they were held prisoner was captured and the crew ed to base.Reflecting on the chaos and confusion of D-Day, does Don recall feeling scared by what was happening around him  \"Well, everybodys scared ndash I dont care what anyone says,\" he replies. \"If youre not scared you dont perform, but its discipline and training that takes you through. You do reach a point of no .\"This is rude, I know, but its what I call s**t or bust. You go on and do it. Its a matter of accepting whats going on and just dealing with it, and doing the job youre supposed to do.\"Its not a question of bravery. Im very suspicious when people say, Oh, youre a brave man, or Youve got a lot of courage. You react to circumstances. Its a question of training and discipline and doing your job, without really recognising the probability of being killed.\"And I think to some extent the unorm protects you ndash you feel less vulnerable when youve got a unorm on and youre acting in that capacity. Everything happens very quickly.\"So Im very suspicious about bravery. I think we react more instinctively based on our training and our own iniduality. I dont think I could have coped with being an infantryman, for instance. I dont know how those chaps did it, because it must have been hell on earth for them.\"Don can look back on hundreds of hours of operational flying in a distinguished RAF career that included missions for the Special Operations Executive. And yet, despite the passage of years, he has never forgotten the thrill of his first tantalising taste of aviation.\"I fell in love with aeroplanes when I was a kid when Alan Cobhams Flying Circus came to visit our town with an old World War One aeroplane, and it was fascinating,\" Don says. \"He had a couple of old SEs [fighter aircraft] and you could have a flip round the field for  shillings ndash but of course  shillings was half a mans wage, so we just stood there with our mouths open.\"But the smell of hot engine oil, castor oil and fumes and what-not got into you. I was determined to try to get into it in some way, and of course thats what I did.\"He grew up in Kingswinford, Worcestershire, where his father ran a transport yard. Don trained as a motor mechanic after leaving school at the age of  and went on to qualy as a motor vehicle technician in the summer of . He was called up when war broke out in September of that year, having joined the volunteer reserve two years previously.After pilot training he enjoyed rapid promotion in Bomber Command and was an acting squadron leader when, ing from a mission near Hanover in May , his aircraft was attacked from below by an unseen German fighter plane. The bomb aimer, navigator, flight engineer and wireless operator were all killed but Don survived along with his mid-upper and rear gunner. Somehow he managed tohis crippled Stirling to an emergency landing field on the east coast of England despite suffering severe spinal injuries, damage to his left eye, lacerations around his head and a hole in his knee. He still bears the scars.Don spent eight months in hospital and was discharged as medically unfit. However, he refused to accept that his flying career was over and lodged an objection with the air ministry. Eventually his appeal was successful and he was reinstated, being retrained in the new discipline of radio observer.Operations in the aftermath of D-Day included Market Garden in September  ndash \"I went to Arnhem five times during that debacle,\" says Don ndash and he continued in Stirlings until .He and his first we Lillian were married in  and they had three children: daughter Elaine, now living in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and sons Peter and Robert, who are both ex-Navy. Peter is in Denmark while Robert has a management post at Dounreay.Don ed to the motor trade after the war and became general service manager with a large garage group. He then spent more than  years working in further education, including a spell as head of the engineering department at a college of technology in Salisbury.Lillian died in  after many years of ill-health and in  Don moved to Thurso, coming out of retirement to work for eight years with local firm Ashley Ann. In  he was married for a second time, to Lybster-born Isabel, whose three daughters became part of the family. Isabel died in .Don still keeps in touch with three of his former crew-mates from those D-Day operations: Jim Wayman, the rear gunner, who lives in Dorset Eric Winter, flight engineer, in Coventry and Sid Harrison, the mid-upper gunner, who lives in Crewe. However, there was a particularly close and enduring bond between Don and his pilot, New Zealander Frank Cox.\"Although our families were half a world apart, they sort of grew up together ndash he came over [to this country] and I went to New Zealand,\" says Don. \"In  his daughter rang me from New Zealand and said Frank was dying of bowel cancer ndash he knew he was terminally ill and he hadnt got long to live. They had asked himthere was anything he really wanted, and hed said, Id love to see my old mate again. So I went to New Zealand and I was with him when he died.\"Now you cant explain relationships like that ndash they exist because of the worth of each one of you to the other in action. Its what they call camaraderie. Im still in touch with his family.\"As his thoughtsto the events of  on the Normandy beaches, Don agrees that D-Day was a turning point ndash \"theres no doubt about that\". But he adds: \"I regret to say I dont think weve learned any lessons. I dont think we should be doing what were doing now [in Iraq].\"As I look back I think first of all how lucky I was and I feel very sad about the people who gave their lives in that struggle. Its not really appreciated, the sacrices that were made both on the home front and in action. Its a sad reflection on society, I feel.\"We ought to be very thankful that were free, because thats what it was about. We should remember that this country wouldnt be freeit had been overrun by Nazi Germany.\"It was all for a cause. People may say, Oh, thats patriotic nonsense. But it isnt.\"* This is a slightly edited version of an interview first published in the John OGroat Journal of June , .Thursday  Jan  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"More festive frustration for Wick Academy as Formartine snatch victory in stoppage time","story":"Wick Academy  Formartine United Formartine United took advantage of a late red card to Danny Mackay to hit an injury-time winner and consign Academy to a second defeat over the festive period.The Scorries struggled to create any clear chances but defended resolutely and the game appeared to be drting towards a goalless draw before Graeme Rodgerrsquos late strike.Manager Tom McKenna made two enforced changes to his side, with Ross Allan and Andrew Hardwick replaced by Gordon MacNab and Craig Gunn. Sixteen-year old Mark Macadie, brother of Richard, made his first appearance on the bench.Academy started positively and Marc Macgregor twice tested Formartine keeper Kevin Main within the opening  minutes ndash first when he scuffed a shot straight at Main after being set up by a driving run down the right from Davie Allan, and then seeing an edge-of-the-box effort comfortably held.With Wick sitting deep in clear defensive blocks of four and five, the visitors took control after that and passed up several decent opportunities to take the lead.Archie Macphee found himself with a clear look at goal a quarter of an hour in but he somehow poked wide of Sean McCarthyrsquos left-hand post, and Rodger followed that moments later by guiding a shot wide of the same spot.After coming through that tough -minute spell, it was Academy who threatened next when, after a great spin in midfield by Grant MacNab, the ball came through for Macgregor whose shot was blocked by Main.The biggest cheer of the half came when Formartine assistant manager Russell Anderson, unhappy with what he felt was a series of unfair decisions against his team, was given a strict talking to by lineswoman Molly Alexander.Academy made a tactical switch with Craig Gunn and Davie Allan swapping wings and Gordon MacNab moving upfield to partner Macgregor up top. The move failed to pay idends as Wick couldnrsquot trouble the away defence throughout the half, Davie Allan coming closest to goal when he skewed his shot wide after a one-two with Macgregor.Formartine similarly struggled to break down a well-drilled home defence, but they smelled blood when Mackay was given a second yellow card in the last minute after a collision with substitute Scott Ferries.It was another Formartine sub who played a key role in the winner when Liam Burnett skipped past Craig Gunn to the by-line and cut back for the unmarked Rodger, who had the simple task of tapping it home.Wick Academy: McCarthy, M Steven, Farquhar, D Mackay, Manson, Henry, Gunn, Macgregor , D Allan, Gordon MacNab , Grant MacNab .

Following on from its four other adaptations of children’s classics, as well as pantomimes and avant-garde entries to the SCDA festival, the group has decided to stage a musical version of Arthur Ransome’s well-known book Swallows and Amazons.Developed for the famous Bristol Old Vic theatre, it tells the story of four rather straight-laced children on holiday in the s, given permission, in those pre-risk assessment days, to take a dinghy out onto the lake with their father’s warning not to be “duffers,” in other words, just to be sensible. They soon get their sense of adventure heightened when they meet the fierce Amazon pirates, otherwise the Blackett sisters, Nancy and Peggy. After a brief “battle of the boats” on the lake, they decide to wage another war against the Blacketts’ Uncle Jim, soon to be renamed “Captain Flint,” simply because he has spent the summer writing a boring book and isn’t a fun uncle any more. That, and a mysterious burglary, makes for an exciting, funny and absorbing play, with a surprise at every turn.The story is great fun, all the more so since the production uses a number of clever devices to turn everyday household objects into boats, rocks, weapons and everything  needed to tell the story. The cast, made up of actors ranging in age from  to  plus, have enjoyed creating their characters and learning the very catchy songs with this year#s musical director Glenys Hughes.Soyou want to see how a hall can be turned into a lake without flooding it, Deerness Dram Group encourage you to come along on February ,  or  and join in the fun!

I realise that the build up in favour of Michael Ross, trying to prove his innocence, has given the book another layer — whether it’s correct or not. I was shocked that there had never been a book on it, but I think that’s because it’s over such a long time period.”On the evening of June , , Bangladeshi waiter Shamsuddin Mahmood was shot dead at the Mumutaz restaurant in Bridge Street, sparking a full-scale murder investigation. Though questioned at the time, it was another  years before Michael Ross was apprehended for the crime. On June , , Mr Ross was convicted of murder at the High Court in Glasgow. Last year, he admitted attempts to escape HM Prison Shotts, where he is currently serving a -year sentence. This came shortly after news that high-profile lawyer Aamar Anwar would be representing him in an appeal case.“It’s an incredible story,” added Mr Clarkson.“I think it’s one of the most extraordinary true crime stories in UK criminal history.”Having already secured a book deal, Mr Clarkson has long-term aspirations of bringing the story to Netflix which he says, has shown interest in making a six-part series about the case. For now, he is trying to get folk who were involved in the case, or who knew Shamsuddin Mahmood or Michael Ross, personally, to come forward.“I’m really interested in speaking to witnesses who were in the restaurant, to Michael’s ex-girlfriend, and to anyone who knew Shamsuddin when he was living here in Orkney,” he explained.“To be fair to the people who are fighting for his innocence, they deserve a voice as well, and they will get a voice in my book, because what I’m trying to do is look at it from all angles.

This produces the wonderful patterns of dancing light that we see in the sky.#According to Mr Swale, the colour of the northern lights ies depending on the type of gas particles that are colliding. Most common is a pale yellowish green, produced by oxygen particles about  miles above the earth. Nitrogen gives out blue or purplish-red light, and the rare, all-red auroras are down to high-altitude oxygen, at heights of up to  miles.“The top places to see these magical light shows are areas free from light pollution,# Mr Swale continued.#You need absolutely clear skies with no clouds and your best bet is to stand somewhere where you have a view of the northern horizon. While they have been seen as far south as Kent and Cornwall, you have much greater chance of seeing them here in Scotlandthe conditions are right, as they get stronger the further north you go.““Andyou don’t get lucky and see the northern lights, you will get a fantastic view of the night sky, peppered with stars.”To find out more about the SNH competition, you can follow their social media channels on Twitter, Facebook or Instagram.For aurora alerts and forecasts, try the AuroraWatch UK, Service Aurora Forecast or the Glendale app.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

SSEN say these changes are aimed at improving the security of supply serving one of Orkney#s most remote islands, enhancing network resilience for the local community.The network operator has also installed new automation equipment on the network which allows SSEN’s teams to remotely operate switches, meaning power can be restored much quicker in the event of a power cut by remotely isolating the affected part of the network.Colin Rendall, SSEN’s Orkney Operations Manager, said: “The work on Sanday forms part of an ongoing commitment to target our investment towards improving network reliability in the areas with the greatest potential impact and improvement for our customers. We’re delighted to have completed this project on time and on budget, providing a more resilient, stronger electricity network for our customers on Sanday.“As a responsible network operator, we worked closely with archaeologists and ecologists to ensure all works were completed in a responsible manner, with careful consideration for the local landscape and environment. We’d like to thank the local community for their support and patience during these works.”This work, delivering on one of SSEN’s business commitments, means the main network line serving  properties from Stove to the north end of Sanday has now been upgraded — resulting in a more resilient network for SSEN’s customers living and working on the island.Mobile generation was deployed throughout the duration of the project to minimise disruption to the island community, ensuring schools, shops, hotels and local businesses stayed on supply whilst SSEN’s engineers undertook this essential work.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Therersquos no record showing where this bonnet came from other than what is said on the label and all that says is it was found in a bog at Fort Augustus.ldquoMr Harbord thinks it might be the earliest surviving example and that seems perfectly feasible.

He told the Ross-shire Journal: ldquoThis issue has rumbled on for some time and as the public interest shows, needs resolved quickly. I have written to Highland Councilrsquos director of community services, William Gilfillan, to ask that he attends a meeting with myself and other local community representatives.ldquoI am eager to get the community and the council round the table and thrash out the best way forward for Fighting Macrsquos monument. I have also written to the ward manager to request a site visit so I can see for myself the locally disputed health and safety concerns.More than  people have already signed a petition pressing Highland Council to take action. It states: ldquoThe time for excuses has passed, we have been let down far too often by officials.Its instigator, George Murray, who is leading moves for a business improvement district in the town, said he was delighted but not surprised by the public response.He said: ldquoThe council never understood the monument is more than just a local landmark with a nice view ndash in our area the MacDonald monument is a source of pride. The first man to ever make it from private to general in the history of the British army was a local from the Black Isle and people are proud of that history, why wouldnrsquot they be He said: ldquoWhat that shows is just how big the disconnect between the people and the council really is ndash I suspect its own officials are out of touch with the new chief executive, at least she listens.ldquoPeople are saying how they loved going up there as a child and how good it would be for education ndash the closure has really hurt the town.Dingwall Community Council chairman Jack Shepherd said support for the petition was a good indication of the strength of feeling towards getting the monument reopened.One who signed the petition, Iona McAuley,said: ldquoI used to love visiting the monument every Thursday evening with the Dingwall in Bloom group. I often take my children up to sit at the canons and tell them the story behind it. I have promised one day Irsquoll take them inside ndash hopefully in the near future.Another, Ireneusz Grochowski, said: ldquoIt would be great to see Dingwall from the top of the monument.

I’m a sensitive little soul really, quite a spiritual man as well.”Now, he’s got a new BBC show – Danny Dyer’s Right Royal Family – which is more “me and what I’m about”, he adds with a cheeky grin, in his famed Cockney accent.The two-parter follows on from his revelatory episode of BBC genealogy series Who Do You Think You Are  in which he discovered he descended from King Edward III, and sees him uncover an ever bigger family tree with yet more royal and aristocratic ancestors.Not only that, but talkative Dyer, who was born in Canning Town, east London, fully immerses himself in the lestyles of his relatives, trying out their pursuits and passions.And yes, that does include him dressing up and wearing items such as “a nice pair of tights – I look the b******s in it, I pulled it off,” he says.“It’s me going right back to my first ancestor, a Viking called Rollo, who’s the king of the Vikings – a very powerful man,” he elaborates excitedly.“We make our way back down through eight ancestors’ lives and I live and breathe what their lives were like for a day.“Essentially, it’s a history programme, because that’s what we wanted to do – an educational programme told through my eyes. And me taking the p*** out of myself a little bit – it takes the edge off it slightly.“I’m really proud of it, I’m really happy with it.”You can certainly expect Dyer to bring lots of personality to the programme.“A lot of people might be bored of that boring history formula, and I think it’s a dferent way to learn, so I’m going to try to be as funny as much as I possibly can,” he says.“I like to embrace every historian with a big cuddle at the beginning, to make them settle down, and just have an old chinwag about medieval history.”There are plenty of memorable moments from filming for Dyer, including finding out he was related to a direct descendent of a saint – Saint Louis IX, who was the King of France in the th century.There’s also the time he ate fermented shark, as the locals do, in a Viking village in Sweden.“That was bad, that was bad. And I had to crack a sheep’s skull in half and I had a mouthful of tongue. Listen, it had to be done!”Dyer has three children –Dani, , Sunnie, , and Arty, five – with his we Joanne Mas, and reveals the whole family stars in the show, taking part in an Elizabethan banquet.“I think I’ve driven everyone mad about this and they’re not that interested – they don’t really believe that we’re royal. So I thought I’d roll them in a bit and they’d get it.”Of course, daughter Dani has her own legion of fans now, after winning ITV reality show Love Island last summer.Her dad reckons they’ll love tuning in and seeing her dressed up as an Elizabethan princess.Of filming with his family, he adds: “I enjoyed doing that with them. It was nice and dferent.”But don’t think for one minute that he’s started living like his royal relatives at home now.“Absolutely not. If anything, it makes you more humble about le, and very grateful for who I am. And I suppose, in the past, I haven’t been, so I think we grow as human beings don’t we ”He continues: “I think it’s very important when you’re in the position that I’m in, that you curb that ego and try to nourish your soul as much as you possibly can, and just try to be a decent, kind human being.”No-nonsense Dyer has become something of a national treasure, known for being totally unafraid to say what he thinks, especially, in recent months, when it comes to Brexit, and politics in general.Discussing the topic of being in the limelight further, he notes: “You can lose your head slightly when you’re famous and forget what’s important to you.“So just be a bit more selfless with it, I think that’s what’s important.

Promise.You know the saying: tidy house, tidy mind. The same goes for your desk. A clear and organised workspace equals less visual clutter and distractions, which in turn allows for more brain space to get on with your work. It’s hardly a groundbreaking notion, but it’s one that sometimes gets forgotten as the paperwork mountains begin to rise and form over desks across the globe. Some jobs require a physical paper trail that’s hard to keep on top of, whereas others might be more digital-focused, and it’s less of a paper tower that you’re creating and more of a Pret A Manger porridge pot one. Some of us might have no designated desk space in our roles, others might have their own office . Maybe you’ve got your own cubicle, or you hotdesk, or perhaps you make up the “work from home and only see the postman during your working day” contingent . However your job is set up, the chances are that you’ll have some kind of workspace, and in order to instil some good basic habits into your work routine and Monday-to-Friday grind, it’s a good idea to start with sorting your space so that it’s set up in the most practical way for you and your role, with minimal distractions so you can ward off your midafternoon YouTube rabbit hole. This is the key to having an edited, organised working le.The one-hour desk spring clean routine – Clear your deskYou’ll notice when we get to the “get rid of all your s**t” chapter in my book, that I’m a big fan of making one gigantic pile at the beginning of a clear-out session. Get it out. Toss it into a heap and let the clear-out commence. Your physical reaction to seeing all your desk belongings in one place will most probably be one of dismay, plus the act of clearing your desk to be completely free of stuff means that you can actually give it a spring clean while you’re at it. – Plenty of piles Organise your office clutter by sorting it into piles.PAPERWORK. Place your paperwork into one of three piles: one that’s junk and ready to be recycled, another for paperwork that you have to keep and can’t be digitally stored for some reason , and a pile for paperwork that would be best suited to being scanned into your laptop in PDF format .DECORATIVE STUFF. . Got any knick-knacks that are just making the joint look messy and aren’t bringing you any joy to look at  Bin ’em immediately.THINGS YOU ACTUALLY USE. Reserve this pile for things that you find yourself using often – at least once a week – that it makes sense to have within arm’s reach.THINGS YOU DON’T. Group together items that could be donated or handed off to fellow employees .  – Re-jig your layout Ready for a rule  Here’s a little tiny one that’s easy to abide by, doesn’t make me sound like an absolute tyrant and will help keep your newly clean and organised desk in check. If it’s an item that you use in some capacity every single working day, then it’s allowed to be in close proximity – either tucked away or neatly displayed on your desk. If it’s not something that you use every day, Monday to Friday, then it must be stored in some way. Test it out for a week or so. If there’s anything that you’re having to heave yourself up for and traipse to the other side of the room to retrieve, then re-jig and reorganise until you’re at a place where the only reason you need to get up is to grab your mid-morning croissant, not because you need a pen. – Sort out storageI’m not normally a fan of sourcing storage before you know exactly what’s going in it, as you tend to just fill it with s**t for the sake of it, but you’ve done the groundwork here. From your final pile of things you use often, you might find that you need some storage solutions. Perhaps a set of drawers next to your desk will come in useful to keep those files you need to keep organised and easy to find. Or maybe a little stationery holder for your pens and paperclips  A pencil case! An accordion file! A paper tray! You get the gist here. Office clichés they might be, but they actually do come in handy for keeping a desk orderly and organised, and having these helping hands in place and giving all your items a proper home will lessen the chance of the Leaning Tower of Paper making a reappearance. My desk essentialsBullet journalI go into a lot more detail about this in the book it’s not really a classical Bullet Journal that I use here, but it’s just that I just use some of the techniques to help me plan and schedule. I do have the actual hardcopy of the notebook that they sell . I travel everywhere with it as it holds all my editorial plans and daily to-do lists.StationeryDespite being an actual stationery nerd I only own a few items because I know that cute covered notebooks are my hoarding weak spot, so I try not to even seek them out in the first place. I keep a blue ballpoint pen out, along with a pair of scissors, a ruler , a pack of post-its, a pink and a yellow highlighter to decipher between dferent things in my journal, and that’s it. See  Stationery streamlined  CHECK.Reading materialI don’t keep much physical reading material out on my desk because  per cent of what I read comes from online these days. However, there’s often some kind of self-help “GO GIRL – YOU CAN DO THIS” book that I’m working through that I like to keep out on my desk. As I read through these I like to post-it the pages that I think I’ll find helpful at some point. They probably break the “must use every day” rule, but I do tend to have a flick through at least once a week to reference a point or to get advice on something I’m working on. PaperworkEverything that I do workwise is stored online or “up there”. Rarely there might be a contract I have to sign physically or a form I need to fill out and so I keep those out on display slap-bang centre of my desk so that I’m more likely to complete them ASAP. FurnitureI know we’re talking about desk essentials here, but aside from my desk, my home office spot includes a couple of other basics. I have a printer hidden as best as I can under my desk , a padded office chair that swivelsand a desk light which comes in extremely handy in the winter months when it gets dark at pm, plus it makes nice mood lighting \u2028for when the office doubles up as a second bedroom for guests.Extracted from An Edited Le by Anna Newton , out now©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4845344.1547670810!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit zombie government must spring to life leader comment","story":"The UK is drting dangerously towards a no-deal Brexit so Theresa May must now change course by delaying our departure from the EU and preparing for a second referendum.So, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a country run by zombies. Jeremy Corbyn got at least one thing right about Brexit as he tried, but failed, to remove Theresa May from office.At a time when we need our government to act decisively, official policy seems to be one of inaction with the only response to the biggest government defeat in British political history to press ahead with much the same plan.And, last night, the response of MPs to the rapidly escalating crisis was to express their confidence in this undead administration, a government unable to perform its basic : to govern. These are most surreal times. : Brexit: Mike Russell calls for May to rule out no deal ‘forever’May’s strategy appears to be to hope that alarm over this country’s drt towards the dangerous prospect of a no-deal Brexit builds to the point that enough MPs are panicked into backing her, fearing the resulting economic turmoil.Had Tuesday night’s “meaningful vote” on her Brexit plan been closer, this might have worked. It feels like a strategy drawn up in advance with a closer margin of defeat in mind, but, given the record-breaking majority of  against the government, it seems doomed to fail. The Prime Minister would need to be a political genius to win the extremely risky game of chicken that she seems intent on playing with the health of the UK economy. A majority of MPs may be opposed to a no-deal Brexit, but they could be out-manoeuvred as time runs out by those reckless enough to support it. It is hard to blame May for the death of effective government at Westminster at precisely the wrong time. She has tried to come up with a pragmatic compromise, a deal that would minimise the damage to the UK economy while placating the passions of hard-line Brexiteers.Unfortunately, as French President Emmanuel Macron pointed out yesterday, their vision of Brexit was always a fantasy. “Good luck to the representatives of the nation who have to implement a thing which doesn’t exist,” he said. However, the clock is ticking and this is no time for finger-pointing. Instead, May needs to abandon her trademark stubbornness and ask the EU to delay Brexit from its current date of  March and begin plans for a second referendum. This would prevent an accidentalno-deal Brexit – and might just scare Tory hardliners into backing her plan, thereby securing a most unlikely victory.: Theresa May’s Brexit deal suffers worst defeat in British political history©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4857392.1547647215!/image/image.jpg","title":"brexit nicola sturgeon promises independence timetable in weeks","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has said Theresa May is #deluding herself# by trying to persist with her Brexit red lines, and suggested details of the timetable for a second Scottish independence referendum would be revealed within #weeks#.The First Minister was at Westminster to meet with SNP MPs, and said an extension of Article  and a People’s Vote were the only realistic options to break the Brexit deadlock.However, she added: “I’ll say more about the timing of a referendum in the next matter of weeks.“I want to see the UK stay in the EU, I think that would be best for the whole of the UK... even when Scotland is independent, that serves our interests best as well. That’s why we’re backing the Peoples Vote, the second EU referendum.“Butthat’s not possible, in terms of our wider interests, the chaos and the fiasco of the last couple of years have shown that the worst thing for Scotland is to be thirled to Westminster when it’s making such a mess of things.

He said any previous prime minister would have resigned following the crushing -vote defeat of her Brexit deal.“There has been no communication on all-party talks,” Mr Corbyn said. “All the Prime Minister said was she might talk to some members of the House.“That is not recognising the scale of the defeat they suffered last night.”Responding to Mr Corbyn’s no-confidence motion, Mrs May dismissed his call for a general election saying it would be “the worst thing we could do”.“It would deepen ision when we need unity, it would bring chaos when we need certainty, and it would bring delay when we need to move forward,” she said.John Woodcock, who resigned the Labour whip to sit as an independent in protest at his party’s leadership, said “with a heavy heart” he could not support the no confidence motion, adding Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell “are simply not fit to hold high office”.Rounding off the attack on Mrs May, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson raised the temperature of what had been a sparsely attended, low-key debate, claiming Tory MPs “know in their hearts that this Prime Minister is not capable of getting a deal through”.“No one doubts her determination, which is generally an admirable quality, but misapplied it can be toxic,” he said.“The cruellest truth of all is that she does not possess the necessary skills – the political skills, the empathy, the ability and, most crucially, the policy – to lead this country any longer.”Mr Watson accused Mrs May of “humiliating the United Kingdom”, telling MPs: “The country feels genuinely sorry for the Prime Minister.“I feel sorry for the Prime Minister. But she cannot confuse pity with political legitimacy.”Environment Secretary Michael Gove hit back in kind, saying Mr Watson had failed to mention Mr Corbyn once. To loud cheers from Tory MPs, Mr Gove taunted: “We both recognise that Mr Corbyn is about he worst possible person to lead the Labour Party.”In a fierce attack on Mr Corbyn’s record, the Environment Secretary accused the Labour leader of siding with Hamas terrorists and Vladimir Putin’s Russia.“While we are standing up for national security, what about Mr Corbyn ” Mr Gove asked. “He wants to leave Nato, he wants to get rid of our nuclear deterrent.“And recently he said in a speech, why do countries boast about the size of their armies  That is quite wrong, why don’t we emulate Costa Rica, that has no army at all “No allies, no deterrent, no army, no way can this country ever allow that man to be our Prime Minister.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lerwick speeders under scrutiny at community council ","story":"A plea was made for more speed checks on drivers coming into the town via the old north road.The issue of speeding cars was raised by community councillor Gary Robinson.

The rig was still there on Friday .Alistair Philp, secretary of the North West Responsible Fisherman’s Association, praised KPL for the standard of communication with the affected fishermen.He said: “They have been pretty good with updating us. We have been getting passage plans and times and we have been disseminating that information out to the local fishermen.

So far, the fishermen and KPL are working together to minimise disruption. Hopefully,there are any issues, they can be resolved in good faith afterwards.“Considering this may become a regular occurrence and some fishermen are dedicating considerable time to moving gear clear and then once the rig is in Kishorn will have to dedicate considerable time to reinstating their gear, it would only seem reasonable in future to consider our options for some sort of compensation for the disruption.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"closure of tarbert ferry service to vehicles unavoidable say","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCalMac’s director of service has  described a planned temporary closure of the linkspan at Tarbert ferry terminal as “unavoidable disruption”.The operator has announced the vehicle service will be out of action for five days across February and March.

However, for safety reasons, we have decided not to delay the replacement. We are working with the team at CalMac and our contractor to ensure this work is carried out with as little disturbance to services as possible.”CalMac’s director of service delivery David Gibson said: “We have tried to build services around this unavoidable disruption as best we can to minimise the impact to communities during this period whilst the work is completed as quickly as is possible.”CalMac have advised that services for foot passengers will be provided during the disruption on normal service days on both routes. for details. of January.MEANWHILE, CalMac’s parent company David MacBrayne Limited has this week announced the appointment of Duncan Mackison as the group’s new chief executive officer.Mr Mackison, a former Royal Marine Commando Officer, comes into the role having recently held the post of Managing Director of Serco Defence.Service provider Serco had previously lost out to CalMac in their bid to operate Hebridean and Clyde ferries.In his position at Serco, Mr Mackison had responsibility for managing aviation and maritime contracts for the Ministry of Defence.This included the provision of vessels to provide maritime support to the Royal Navy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8768911.1547477230!/image/image.jpg","title":"antrim emergency department under extreme pressure","story":"The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has issued advice to residents as  people continue to wait for beds at Antrim Area Hospital.

Violence is endemic, paramilitary groups continue their activity, we have had numerous years when no local government was possible, and the Assembly hasn’t sat for the last two years.”Mr O’Loan’s remarks sparked a strong reaction from Ian Paisley, who said nationalist rhetoric “can only surviveit talks down the Union and NI”. The North Antrim DUP MP told the News Letter that the “continuous campaign of terror” waged by the IRA had “stunted the economic growth” of Northern Ireland.“It is convenient for nationalists to ignore this as their ideology benighted from its consequences,” he added. “Despite the  years of terror, NI has survived, now boasts the lowest levels of unemployment in our history, the highest levels of inward investment outside of London and is a hub for many key businesses. Nationalism survives on a dialogue of talking down NI hence I am not surprised by such comments.”Charges withdrawn against man accused of pointing gun at Orange paradeTree-mendous recycling efforts Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8762003.1546953788!/image/image.jpg","title":"tree mendous recycling efforts","story":"The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim has thanked residents who are #treecycling# after Christmas.In the run-up to the festive season, the council encouraged citizens to recycle unwanted items and responsibly dispose of all waste, including Christmas trees.And Mayor Lindsay Millar said she has been impressed by the number of people visiting Household Recycling Centres in order for their trees to be turned into high-quality compost for our parks and gardens in Mid and East Antrim.Cllr.

This is an issue which needs addressing and one which requires a Strategy, to be put in place.Whilst I like the idea of our local Assembly producing a strategy, it is vital that this statistic is reduced, drastically.”Ian’s we Beverley lost a family member over  years ago, through suicide. Beverley commented: “our family knows only too well the pain and heartache which family and friends endure, following such a tragic loss. For many years, you ask the question why.You also wonder,only they had engaged with someone, and that person had been able to offer some glimmer of hope, which resulted in them not pursuing their course of action. “There have been a number of suicides in our town recently and since the Samaritans are a wonderful organisation, who offer a tremendous telephone helpline service, we thought that it would be worthwhile to try and raise some funds, for this great charity.”The Samaritans’s vision is that fewer people die by suicide. They believe that it is time to look beyond the statistics and into the real lives of these people, so that they and others, can find ways, to reduce any unnecessary deaths. The Samaritans know that when people are in crisis, talking can help that person.Beverley added: “ the money raised at this event, can fund just one phone call to the Samaritans and the Samaritan at the other end of the line is able to provide some hope and results in one person not proceeding with their plan to take their own le,then this event will have been very worthwhile. “I would appeal to anyone who is facing dficulties, no matter what they are, to call the Samaritans on  . The Samaritans volunteers provide a listening ear,  days per year and you can call them any hour of the day, or night,”If you are able to help out in any small way, by baking a few scones tray bakes or by just coming along to have a cuppa and a scone and to give a donation, the organisers will certainly appreciate your kindness.IN PICTURES: Dromore High opens its doors to prospective pupils Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_auto,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8770151.1547557159!/image/image.jpg","title":"education  ","story":"Dromore High School recently welcomed prospective pupils to the school.

Schoolchildren, cyclists, runners, older people and people with acute medical conditions immediately spring to mind, but in fact I think everyone should carry an ICE Card. People don’t think twice about wearing a seatbelt or cycling helmet, butyou had a serious accident you’d like your next of kin to know as soon as possible and you’d want the best care possible in a medical emergency. Almost everyone carries a wallet or purse with them so this is the ideal place to keep an ICE Card”.Chief Inspector Barney O’Connor commented: “PSNI is fully supportive of this initiative which is straightforward, practical and user-friendly and provides families reassurance that a loved one has personal information accessible in all emergency situations. Ideal for use whether you are a student studying away from home, an older person or someone with a medical condition.”The ICE Card ensures all the essential information is accessible in one place meaning it could help save lives, provide the best help and care, as well as make sure your next of kin can be contacted promptly.Information about medications and allergies helps ambulance personnel make better decisions about treatments they can give you and crucially in the case of heavy blood loss, it is important for emergency staff to know your blood type. In the case of people with conditions such asAlzheimer’s it can help a person who may be confused contact their family and avoid any unnecessary distress.The cards are initially being rolled out at PCSP and PSNI engagement events and through groups.

Why  Because De Gaulle called it right. England doesn’t belong in Europe, remains Atlanticist, attached to imperial preference, consumed by the ‘great-game’ of ide-and-rule, of balancing powers in Europe, never committed to “ever closer union”, focused on financial chicanery over agriculture and manufacturing. Was De Gaulle wrong  After the illusion of the Edward Heath era, Britain was only ever in Europe to disrupt it. That game is now up.Whether through opt-outs or rebates, through Maastrict and Lisbon, England’s subsequent conduct in Europe has been as drag-weight and chief saboteur. On reunication, Francois Mitterrand sought to bind Helmut Kohl’s Germany to deepen the European core. British diplomacy embraced Eastern Europe to widen, make shallow and reduce it to free-trading nations. England weighed in under Ireland’s Pat Cox’s cloak to undermine the Commission, the EU’s centre of gravity. And the Jacques Delors social-Europe of the s gave way, under English influence, to free-market liberalism.Things turned with the creation of the Euro. Decisions, increasingly, were taken by the Eurozone. The capacity to disrupt waned, the mileage for further meddling ran out. Whether Little-England or Global Britain, Brexit was the means to get out, to save its soul, or lose the sense of itself. Will England’s dficulty be Northern Ireland’s opportunity I hope so. Northern Ireland is a profoundly dysal polity. Alone in Europe we cannot elect thegovernment. We can’t vote Labour. Conservatives don’t seek a mandate here. We can’t elect the government and more importantly, we can’t chuck a bad government out.Voting in the Northern Ireland entity is like going into the bookies and being told you can back any horse you want – except the horses that might win. We can vote for losers all day long, but not winners. After  years of Northern Ireland, we remain a quarantined zone, the UK’s political slum. Local government is through a Stormont-based native-council, or what apartheid-era South Africans called a Bantustan. Well subsidised, maybe, but a Bantustan nonetheless.As a long-time campaigner to normalise politics within the UK, that avenue is long closed, over, dead. The Brexit vote has allowed us to throw the balls in the air. ‘Creative-chaos’, the policy wonks call it. Or Tony Blair’s prophetic words, to shake the kaleidoscope, and re-order our world. After a change of government, a hard Brexit will allow us to re-join Europe through a border-poll. A hard Brexit will allow us to join an independent Irish state, whose government we can, at least, elect. A border poll, for people like me, is a vote to get the vote # for the first time ever. I’d do that in a heartbeat.The Deltapoll online poll published in September  asked the question: “Imagine now that the UK decided to leave the EU. Under these circumstances how would you vote in a referendum on the constitutional arrangements of the island of Ireland ”More than half, %, said they would vote for a united Ireland, while % said they would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK. In the event of a ‘hard’ Border, % said they would vote for unity, with only % voting to remain in the UK.The most recent Lucidpoll, published in December found, in the event of a ‘No-Deal’ Brexit, % would vote for unity, with only % to remain in the UK.These polling figures are unparalleled since partition.A hard Brexit will hasten the break up of the UK in other ways. Scotland will have a second independence vote, a second penalty kick to drt off, politically, towards Scandinavia. Whether they have the cojones to do so remains to be seen, but my vote for creative chaos gives them the chance.Hard Brexit will see the City of London diminish. The apex of an imbalanced economy, the ‘City’ is, effectively, a criminal paradise facilitating money-laundering, tax-evasion and the myriad dodgy financial products of predatory casino capitalism. Economists like the ’s Larry Elliot believe the shock-treatment of EU withdrawal could force Britain to focus on developing the real, productive, manufacturing base required to re-balance the economy. What’s not to like Whether Little England or Global Britain, the UK is splintering.And we, locked in the Northern Ireland entity, may soon be admitted to the franchise.

Mrs May has called for politicians to back her deal or risk letting the British people down. But with many of her own MPs expected to join opposition parties to vote against the deal, it is widely expected to be defeated.MPs will also be able to suggest amendments that could reshape the deal before voting commences this evening.Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald TD has said the EU backstop cannot be set aside or diluted.Speaking from Stormont after she and Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O’Neill met leaders of the north’s main political parties, Mary Lou McDonald said: #Whatever transpires at Westminster it is essential that Irish interests are protected that the economy is protected and that the Good Friday Agreement is protected in all its parts.#We have commitments from our partners at an EU level that the needs of this island north and south have been recognised and will be protected. Sinn Féin expects those commitments to be honoured and that is what we have been making clear to the Irish government and the EU.#There is no such thing as a good Brexit but the backstop is the bottom line. Anyone who imagines that can be unpicked or diluted or set aside isn#t dealing with the political realities. The DUP position on Brexit is reckless and irresponsible. It certainly is not in the interests of the people of the north of Ireland. I would urge all political leaders to act in the interests of workers, of communities, of society and political stability.”DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds said that Mrs May should ask for and deliver changes to a Withdrawal Agreement. Despite a letter of supposed reassurance from the EU, he saidthere are “no legally binding assurances” as the Prime Minister talked about in December.“In fact, there is nothing new, nothing has changed,” he said. “Rather than reassure us, the Tusk and Juncker letter bolsters our concerns by confirming that everything the Attorney General said in his legal advice regarding the backstop, still stands, there has been no change to the Withdrawal Agreement and Northern Ireland would be subject to EU laws with no representation in Brussels. We would rely on the Dublin government to speak up for us. I stead of meaningless letters, the Prime Minister should now ask for and deliver changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"patricias latest work set to banish january blues with latest work","story":"MONDAY morning and a trip across the city to the old Belfast politan College on Tower Street ,whose beauty and hair salon is proving the perfect rehearsal space for Patricia Gormley’s latest work ‘Is That Too Hot ’Set in the world of hairdryers, rollers, straighteners and all things beauty, the hilarious sequel to ‘I’ll Tell My Ma’ is heading to The MAC stage this month to lt our spirits during the post-holiday slump.West Belfast scribe Patricia, who has performed her work across the city on many stages from the Cultúrlann to the Lyric, in her new play traces the antics of Granny Eileen, Davina Carina and Cha Marie as they stumble their way through another year in their ever turbulent lives as they pop in and out of their local hairdressers for a cuppa, a ‘curly blowdry’ and a catch-up.Starring Christina Nelson, who brought Patricia’s work and characters to le on the Lyric stage last year, and Roisin Gallagher, both actors told Daily Belfast how audiences are in for a treat when curtain comes up.“I play the character of Olive, in whose salon the stories of each character unfold in,” explained Roisin. “Olive has her own drama going on which the audience find out about throughout the piece. It is based on a real le person and hairdressers in the heart of West Belfast. It’s a brilliant observational piece and it’s a story about what happens at the heart of any community that has people who are lonely, struggling, having relationship problems and maybe don’t have anyone to speak to and are coming to this place for their own needs once a week. As Olive says in the play, “This place is like a psychiatrist’s couch, only they get to sit in a swivel chair. The character of Olive hears more about what is going on than the priest,” she laughed.Fresh from her stint as the white rabbit in the Lyric’s Alice the Musical, Christina Nelson is preparing to transform once again into a iety of roles for this sequel. “Granny Eileen, feisty as ever, is back, bless her, back from Turkey where she had a great old time. Cha Marie is back and Patricia has written a new character, Mrs Hughes, who is a bit of a prickly one and worth a watching.”Christina continued: “The energy with Roisin is brilliant, we are working brilliantly together and we are working our socks off to make sure those coming to see us will be laughing in their seats.“So much of everyday le is heard and discussed in the hairdressers, some people even just go to sit under the dryer to get a bit of heat, get a cup of tea brought to them. It’s very much a social thing and they are very much embedded throughout communities.”When asked about plans for a trilogy, Christina revealed that Patricia is “writing as we speak.” “Granny Eileen will definitely be back and there is more to come for these characters.”The new production will reunite Roisin with her recent Bah, Humbug! co-star Alan McKee, who this time will be sitting in the director’s chair. The former St Genevieve’s High School pupil will also be bringing her own work to The MAC stage in March with the self-penned Natural Disaster. “I wrote this piece, it’s what I would call a creative documentation, after my daddy passed away last Christmas. It’s like a journey through grief and I had documented things during that time that were said whether they were funny and sad. It’s not all doom and gloom, though, it’s how we look at grief, how we carry it with us and it will be great to perform it at The MAC following our run with this show.”“You can’t help but fall in love with these characters,” said Roisin. “It’s the perfect tonic for people needing a lt in January to put their worries away for an hour or two and come and see the show.”Is That Too Hot runs at The MAC from January  until February .

Annual social security expenditure in Northern Ireland totals £.bn, of which £bn is administered by the Department for Communities .The report says the DfC has estimated that implementing reforms will cost more than £.bn, and £.bn has been set aside to mitigate their impact. The Government has not allocated any additional money to cover a further £bn in costs.Commenting on the effect of welfare reform after March , Comptroller and Auditor General Mr Donnelly said: \"Northern Ireland has been insulated from the full impact of welfare reforms by the availability of mitigation schemes and local flexibilities. \"When the mitigation schemes end, there is a risk that we will see the same hardship and increase in the demand for foodbanks, reported where in the UK.\"The departments current review of mitigations should focus on what actions need to be taken to address this very real risk.\"The Government began to roll out welfare reforms in the rest of the UK in . After the Fresh start Agreement in , Northern Ireland followed suit. Universal Credit replaces a range of benefits, including Income Support, income-based Jobseekers Allowance and Housing Benefit. By June of last year, , Universal Credit claimants here had been processed. Between July  and March , there will be a \"managed migration\" of around , claimants.Personal Independence Paymenthas replaced Disability Living Allowancefor working-age claimants.In total, , DLA recipients have been reassessed under PIP rules, with % qualying for payments. Some , new claims for PIP have been received, with % qualying for the new benefit.The DfC estimates that these reforms in Northern Ireland will save the Government approximately £bn by  .Mr Donnelly said welfare reforms provide \"signicant challenges\" to the DfC due to the large number of claimants, complex benefit regulations and ensuring claimants receive their benefits on time. He said it is \"too early to comment\" on whether the DfC is \"likely to achieve the savings it has estimated or overall value for money\". \"Savings from welfare reforms go to HM Treasury directly not Northern Ireland,\" Mr Donnelly said. \"To balance this, it is imperative that robust cross-departmental strategies are in place to boost the local labour market and strengthen the economy to make work pay.\"The NIAO report says that many of those consulted found the benefits system \"even more complex than it was before welfare reforms were introduced\". It added that to date the largest financial losses to claimants have arisen from changes to Tax Credits, Child Benefit and reductions in annual benefit rate uplts.It adds that the \"dficulties and problems encountered by disabled and low-paid households across Northern Ireland are likely to increase in April  after the current mitigation measures end\".It states: \"Current social housing stock remains unsuitable, with many thousands of social tenants under-occupying, and will therefore be subject to reductions in benefits post . \"While the absence of a Northern Ireland Executive exacerbates the position, it is imperative that options are available for ministers to consider when the Assembly s.\"It recommends that the DfC \"takes the lead on a programme of research to assess the wider impacts of welfare reforms\" in Northern Ireland, as well as a review into the \"reasons behind the lower than expected uptake of mitigation payments\".The report also says welfare reforms could pose a \"signicant financial risk\" to the Housing Executive , which \"has estimated that its arrears will increase by £.m in - due to the move to Universal Credit\".It added that the NIHE receives over £.m in mitigation payments every year, and from March  \"will have to collect a minimum of £.m of additional rent from its tenants\".A DfC spokesman said: \"Decisions on the provision of future mitigation measures from April  will be a matter for an incoming ministers and the Executive. In the meantime, the department will continue to operate and plan on the basis of the existing agreement and legislation. \"In addition, the department is piloting a social supermarket scheme in five areas of Northern Ireland which aims to provide people with a pathway out of poverty by providing access to food and other services like advice, help with budgeting and managing debt, skills and employability training.\"When asked the reason for the £m underspend, the DfC spokesman said reasons included that the \"start date for a number of the reforms was later than expected, uptake on the mitigations has been lower than expected, the department has seen a higher number of awards for PIP, which in turn has negated the need for mitigation to be paid for many, and the Cost of Work Allowance has not been introduced\".\"None of this underspend has been lost and was ed to the Northern Ireland block grant to be reallocated,\" they added.The NIHE said it would continue to collect rents \"through our normal processes\", adding: \"We work with all tenants affected to assist them with any changes in their circumstances\".It that \"any reduction in our rental income is likely to mean less investment in our homes\", and that it will \"work with the DfC to explore the potential impacts on our tenants and on our own rental income\"."},{"url":null,"title":"the orange state is gone and its not coming back says mcdonald on 100th anniversary of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The most obvious way would be for the Government to table a simple stand-alone Bill, as was the case for the  referendum. However, Prime Minister Theresa May has made clear she is firmly opposed to the idea.An alternative route could be for MPs to try to amend another piece of relevant legislation.– How long would it take In the case of the  referendum, it took seven months to get the Bill through Parliament – although in practice it could be done much more quickly.The Electoral Commission then has a statutory duty to assess the referendum question to ensure it is intelligible and free from bias – a process which would normally take up to  weeks, although again it could be shortened.The legislation would specy theof the referendum campaign. All recent campaigns have lasted at least  weeks.Overall, the Institute for Government estimates the whole process could take up to five months.– What would that mean for the Brexit timetable On current plans, Britain is due to leave the EU on March , so it could not be completed by then.Therefore, for a referendum to be held, the Government would have to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to the Article  withdrawal process – something the EU may or may not grant.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  For a second referendum to be held, the Government would have to go to Brussels to ask for an extension to the Article  withdrawal process – What would be the question on the ballot paper This is where it gets complicated.Generally referendums offer a simple choice between two options – as in  when it was Leave or Remain. However, most MPs accept that there would have to be at least three options – leave with a deal, leave without a deal, or remain in the EU.– How would that work Various ideas have been floated.One would be for voters to rank the options in order of preference. If none of the options gained an overall majority of first preference votes, the one with the fewest votes would be eliminated and its second preference votes would be distributed among the other two.Alternatively, voters could just be given one choice. If none received an overall majority, the one with the fewest votes would again be eliminated, but under this scheme the other two options would then go forward to a final ballot a week later.A third way could be to have a two-question ballot. The first would askvoters wanted to Leave or Remain. The second would ask them to choose between a deal and a no-deal Brexit in the event that there is still a majority for Leave.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A counter tallies ballot papers after the referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU in  – Where do the political parties stand The Conservatives officially oppose a second referendum, arguing that voters made their views clear in  and that another ballot would simply exacerbate the bitter isions opened up by the Brexit debate.However, a growing number of mainly Remain-supporting backbench Tory MPs are warming to the idea, believing it offers a way out of the current impasse.Labour says it wants a general election, butthat is not possible all options are on the table – including a second referendum.Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, a longstanding Eurosceptic, has, however, shown little enthusiasm for the idea, while some of his supporters fear it could alienate traditional Labour voters in Leave-supporting areas.However, he is facing a groundswell of support from within the party for another vote, including from many of the young Momentum activists who propelled him to the leadership and who are passionately opposed to Brexit.Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP – which opposes Brexit – will back a second referendum in the Commons.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the SNP will back a second referendum – Are there any precedents for a second referendum In the UK, not really. However in other countries, where referendums are more common, there is a history of giving voters a chance to think again.In Ireland, for example, in  voters supported ratication of the EU Lisbon Treaty, having rejected it at the first time of asking.Similarly, in , the Irish voted for the Nice Treaty on the second occasion."},{"url":null,"title":"the clock could be reset on article 50 if","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

EU officials are understood to be examining plans to reset the clock - but cannot do so without a request from the Government. Crucially, Germany and France have indicated their willingness to extend Article . Plus, sources have indicated that Dublin \"will not have any issue with an extension provided the backstop remains in place at the end\". As the uncertainty grows, plans for a no-deal Brexit in the Republic have been upgraded from contingency status to the implementation stage. Last night Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told a private Fine Gael meeting that the Irish Government \"continue to hold their position and nerve in relation to Brexit\".Dublin was shaken by comments by Transport Minister Shane Ross in which he appeared to confirm that border checks would be required in the event of a the UK leaving without a deal. Mr Varadkar again insisted yesterday that there is no \"secret plan\" to impose a hard border. \"This is a problem that began in Westminster with the referendum on Brexit,\" he said. \"We found a solution: the withdrawal agreement negotiated over several months and agreed by  governments. \"Now Westminster has rejected that solution. Therefore the problem lies in Westminster.\" He welcomed Mrs Mays move to try to break the deadlock in the House of Commons by meeting with other party leaders. But her olive branch was last night rejected by Labours Jeremy Corbyn, who refused to have substantive talks the Prime Minister unless she took no-deal off the table. A Downing Street spokesman said Mrs May was not going to bow to the demand. \"The Prime Minister has been very clear that the British public voted to leave the European Union. We want to leave with a deal, but she is determined to deliver on the verdict of the British public, and that is to leave the EU on March  this year,\" he said. However, when asked about the idea of delaying Brexit one of Mrs Mays closest allies, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, said nothing should be taken off the table. There have been discussions at EU level about a possible three-month delay - but it is understood the legal implications of stalling the process until  are now being investigated. The DUP opposes the idea of an extension, with MP Nigel Dodds saying \"its not in my view necessary because the EU can act when it wants to\". However, the EUs chief negotiator Michel Barnier firmly rejected the idea of backtracking on the current border plan. \"The backstop which we agreed to with the UK must remain a backstop. It must remain a credible backstop,\" he said.

That is incompatible with either ‘a’ or ‘the’ customs union.”Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mrs May “seems to be negating the discussions before they have even started.”However, under questioning from Conservative grandee Kenneth Clarke in the Commons, the PM appeared to leave open the door to a possible extension of the Article  withdrawal process, which will see Britain leave the EU on March , to allow more time for a deal.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The PM is now due to set out her alternative plan for EU withdrawal to MPs on Monday.But she risks losing control of the Brexit process, as she must table a motion which can be amended by MPs.They are expected to use the opportunity to seek Commons support for a range of possible outcomes, from ruling out no-deal or opting for Norway-style membership of the single market to a second referendum.Sir Vince signalled that the Lib Dems will table a People’s Vote amendment.And Mr Blackford said: “The SNP is committed to working constructively with the Prime Minister, however the option of ruling out a no-deal, extending Article  and holding a People’s Vote must now be on the table.”Useful discussion with the Prime Minister.Lessons will need to be learned from the vote in Parliament. The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end. pic cbVGNQobta— Nigel DoddsJanuary , Following talks with the PM in Downing Street , DUP leader Arlene Foster said: “Lessons will need to be learned from the vote in Parliament.“The issue of the backstop needs to be dealt and we will continue to work to that end.”Meanwhile, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said he “profoundly” regretted the Commons vote and added it was now up to the British Government to say how it intended to proceed.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Michel Barnier said he ‘profoundly’ regrets the vote to reject the Brexit deal “An orderly withdrawal will remain our absolute priority in the coming weeks,” he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg.He said there would be a “favourable response” from the EU sideMrs May was prepared to re-think her negotiating “red lines” and seek a more “ambitious” deal with Brussels.But he firmly rejected calls from some Conservative MPs and the DUP to drop the Northern Ireland “backstop”, intended to ensure there is no hard border with the Republic.“The backstop which we agreed to with the UK must remain a backstop. It must remain a credible backstop,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"artist creates installation to play totos africa for eternity in namib desert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The artwork consists of an MP player containing only Africa, which was first released as a single in , linked to six speakers.“The song is put on loop and the installation runs on solar batteries to keep Toto going for all eternity,” Siedentopf wrote on his website.Siedentopf said the artwork was inspired by the ever growing popularity of the song, which was recently covered by both Weezer and Pitbull and has become a staple of bizarre internet cover versions and memes.He told NPR: “I was very intrigued by this and wanted to pay the song the ultimate homage and physically exhibit ‘Africa’ in Africa.“The Namibian desert — which is, with  million years, the oldest desert in the world — seemed to be the perfect spot for this.”Should fans wish to track the artwork down, Siedentopf has included a map to its approximate location on his website.That approximate location seems to take in the entire Namib desert, but the fact that Siedentopf grew up in Windhoek and installed the work while visiting family in Namibia might give a clue to a starting point for any search.This isn’t the first time that hard rotation of the Toto single has hit the headlines.Just a few weeks ago, DJ Michael Savage organised a charity club night in Bristol in which he played Africa on a loop for  hours."},{"url":null,"title":"baby wallaby seen out of mums pouch for first time at yorkshires flamingo land","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationLove to learnGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amazing.— Kristan HeneageJanuary , Bielsa went on to introduce a presentation and some speculated it might contain reference to Derby manager Frank Lampard, who criticised Bielsa for the debacle which has become known as Spygate.Ahhh, panic over. 😅 #LUFC pic cWWxIOzKn— AlexJanuary , Instead though Bielsa’s Powerpoint contained extensive details of Derby’s tactics and style of play, as examples of the research done by the club on their opponents. The coach said he has information on every Championship player, including exactly how many minutes each player has played in ying positions, which drew admiration from many sports journalists.All the data on Harry Wilson is laid before us. He knew everything about the player who didn’t play Bielsa as planned this superbly. Masterclass in teaching a lot of lessons to a lot of people at the same time. #lufc pic rNJsQMgWsr— Adam PopeJanuary , Bielsa even said he once sent Pep Guardiola his dossier on Barcelona as a gt, to which the now Manchester City manager said he knew more about all his players than he did.Unsurprisingly then, people also believed Bielsa might know more about Derby than Lampard.Marcelo Bielsa knows more about Derby County than Frank Lampard. Pass it on.— We Are LeedsJanuary , Frank Lampard must be delighted: he made a big fuss about a guy in the bushes, and now Bielsa is revealing every single minute detail of Derbys tactics over the last two years via Powerpoint to the entire football world.— Daniel Edwards 💚January , Bielsa gave the presentation in Spanish with a translator, adding: “I can’t speak English but I can speak about the  teams in the Championship.”Marcelo Bielsa: \"I cant speak English but I can speak about the  teams in the Championship.\"Inject this into my veins. 😍 #LUFC— LUFCDATAJanuary , Despite Prime Minister Theresa May facing a vote of no confidence in the House of Commons, the Argentinian and his Powerpoint presentation was the top trending topic on Twitter on Wednesday afternoon.Many shrewdly suggested productivity in the city of Leeds may have stagnated during the presentation.Heres a nice graph outlining the work being done in Leeds over the last  minutes. #lufc pic sqOaCbrxYy— Mr GeldardJanuary , Indeed some thought Bielsa’s presentation was merely a distraction whilst his staff scouted Leeds’ next opponents, Stoke City.Genius from Bielsa - while everyone is at his press conference, his coaching staff are in Stoke getting ready for the weekend— Ben GoodwinJanuary , Bielsa completed his speech with something of a mic drop.Once Bielsa finished his presentation he turned to the room and said: “Thank you for listening. Goodbye.” Proceeded to open the door and walk out. About as close to a mic drop as it gets. #lufc— Joe UrquhartJanuary , After the press conference, BBC journalist Adam Pope shared a video of stacks of files Bielsa had laid out, filled with data on Leeds’ opponents.Bielsa’s light reading #lufc pic oRspXBB— Adam PopeJanuary , All in all, Bielsa made quite the impression on football fans.This is Marcelo Bielsa’s world, we’re all just living in it.— MattyJanuary , Strong words."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit economic consequences no deal brexit cannot ignored elisha mccallion","story":"With around two hours to go before the crucial debate on Theresa May’s Brexit deal, the Sinn Fein MP for Foyle has said that the latest warning from the business community about the devastating economic consequences of a no-deal Brexit cannot be ignored.Mrs McCallion was commenting after the Ibec CBI Joint Business Council warned that a no deal would jeopardise jobs and the all-island economy.She said: “In the latest stark warning from the business community, Ibec and CBI have predicted that a no deal would do signicant harm to jobs, investment, living standards and the all-Ireland economy,” Elisha McCallion said.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“In particular Angela McGowan CBI CEO said that ‘the assurances that business have been crying out for are broadly provided for in the Withdrawal Agreement – ignoring that in pursuit of no-deal isnt just economic recklessness, its an affront to rational thinking.’Elisha McCallion added: “However, the DUP continues to do precisely that by pursuing a reckless agenda leading towards a no-deal Brexit which will have devastating consequences for the entire island of Ireland.“They cannot be allowed to succeed.

Nobody would mind paying to use an open, clean facility instead of going behind a tree..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"‘Utter confusion’ at bin collections and overfull skips  ","story":"RATEPAYERS across the district were left confused about alternative bin collection arrangements over the Christmas holiday period, according to a local politician.Mournes councillor Laura Devlin said there was also frustration that household recycling centres struggled to cope with the huge volume of waste and that many were forced to close early.Cllr Devlin has met with Newry, Mourne and Down Council officials to discuss the issue which resulted in what she described as ldquototal confusion over Christmas bin collections.She said she was inundated with queries about alternative household bin collections due to the bank holidays and claimed that residents did not receive direct communication from the local authority, with the onus on householders to check social media or press advertisements.ldquoThis simply wasnrsquot good enough and didnrsquot work, declared Cllr Devlin. ldquoIf the council is serious about recycling and ensuring that its targets are met, as well as delivering a fit-for-purpose service to ratepayers, we need to improve lines of communication with the public.ldquoThis utter confusion in respect of when bins were to be lted had a knock-on effect on the demand at the household recycling centres with skips filling up much quicker than usual and centres being forced to close.Cllr Devlin said staff at the centres in Castlewellan, Downpatrick and Ballynahinch worked very hard.ldquoFor these staff to be placed in the position of having to deal with many irate members of the public who had duly loaded their cars and travelled to the ious sites which were closed as the skips were full is far from acceptable, she continued.Cllr Devlin explained council officials had taken her concerns on board and had invoked what is being described as a ldquolessons learned exercise.A report on how the service can be improved due to be tabled at the next meeting of the councilrsquos Regulatory and Technical Services Committee.ldquoThe council previously issued collection schedules but these ran out last October. Advising people to check online is all well and good, but we still have many households who donrsquot have access to broadband and people who are not computer literate.ldquoThe council needs to reflect on this and act accordingly and I look forward to seeing these much-needed changes in advance of the next bank holiday, she added.A local authority spokeswoman said Newry, Mourne and Down District Council was aware of a number of issues affecting both the collection of bins, as well as the operation of its household recycling centres over the holiday period.She said the organisation was ldquoactively working to resolve these issues as a matter of urgency..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Aidan’s work to go on display at Down Arts Centre  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND artist famed for his colourful and lelike portrayal of animals is holding his first exhibition at Down Arts Centre.Thirty year-old Aidan Sloan, whose work also includes some locally renowned politicians, will have  pieces on display in the exhibition entitled, lsquoThis Wee Place Herersquo.The talented artist can certainly stretch his imagination to determine what kind of surface to paint on. He has used everything from boards, wooden planks, old suitcases, football tops and even an old Belfast sink for his masterpieces.Aidan, who is often seen at home in his studio with a paintbrush in hand and his six week-old baby daughter Siacutene lying across his shoulder, says he has loved drawing all his le.ldquoIt wasnrsquot until  that I took a career break from my job as a civil servant to look after my young family and try to turn my passion for art into a career, he remarked.ldquoSo far it is going from strength to strength. I fit painting and researching my work in between school runs and the daily routine of having four children.ldquoMy we, Deacutearbhla, and our four children are my inspiration, although I can draw creativity from the subject I am painting too. Sometimes other artists and genres inspire me and perhaps inspiration comes from the meaning behind the painting.ldquoTo be totally honest I just go with what feels right to me at the time. I have no training in art or qualications in art history, but rather I have developed my talent from experimenting with paints, canvases and subjects over the years.ldquoI really admire the work of Christian Hook and Angela Bell. They both have created their own wonderful styles that are unique to them and I would say I have created something of my own style too.The painter, who already has one piece of work hanging in the Ulster Museum as part of the annual Royal Ulster Academy of Arts exhibition, described his delight in seeing his familyrsquos artistic gene falling onto the next generation.ldquoMy three eldest children love art too and they have grown up watching me paint and produce art.ldquoMy youngest child, Siacutene, is only six weeks old but I am sure it wonrsquot be long until she has a paintbrush in her hand. My eldest son, Ethan, won the Art Shield when he left primary school, and my daughter, Riacuteoghnach, who has epilepsy and autism, uses art as a therapeutic way to relax.ldquoHaving them watch me paint is also an inspiration and I feel it demonstrates to them that you should follow your passion and dreams, no matter what.Aidan has some of his own favourites in display at the exhibition, including lsquoBlending In, which is an acrylic painting of a hare on an old loft door, and a portrait of the late David Ervine, former PUP leader, which is acrylic paint and pencil on the inside of an old fishing wader.Heavily influenced by farming and all things agricultural, it comes as a surprise to learn the Co Down artist didnrsquot grow up on a farm.ldquoI often help my brother-in-law out on his farm and quite a few of his cows have become the subject of many of my paintings, he said.ldquoThere was something about the characters of animals that I really felt I could utilise in my paintings. Then I began to produce portraits of people with pencil, and my we encouraged me to try painting them a few years ago.ldquoI am Loughinisland, through and through. This has actually inspired one of the pieces of artwork that will be on display. The exhibition gives an insight into my depiction of growing up in Northern Ireland post-troubles.ldquoIt contains many animals from Northern Ireland, but I have also reflected on some things such as landscapes, political figures and events that had some sort of impact on me when I was growing up.ldquoWhen I was in primary school I loved art and I kept a booklet from P where I said that I wanted to grow up to be an artist. It wasnrsquot until I was in my late s, and with a lot of encouragement from my we, that I realised I could make a career out of something I had always done as a hobby.bull Aidanrsquos work can be admired throughout the month of January up to February  at Down Arts Centre and admission is free..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Devlin and Quinn selected by SDLP for upcoming elections  ","story":"THE SDLP has chosen sitting councillors Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn to defend their seats in the Mournes district electoral area at the forthcoming local government elections.Their nomination was confirmed at a recent selection meeting when the party also confirmed its candidates in the Downpatrick, Rowallane and Slieve Croob areas.Candidates for the Newry, Crotlieve and Slieve Gullion area will be selected shortly as the SDLP aims to increase its membership on Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Devlin said it had been her ldquotremendous honour to serve the people of the Mournes DEA over the past five years.ldquoAs someone who grew up with a strong sense of community and reconciliation, I believe the policies I have pursued during my years on council have adequately reflected that, as have the results, she explained.ldquoThis year will be busy as I am expecting another baby as well as contesting an election.

An engineer explained that a conductor on a transformer, which had probably been smouldering due to a layer of snow or ice, caught fire.Carryduff, the highest point between Belfast and the Mourne mountains, had falls of up to six inches and drts were reported as deep as one and two feet in some areas.Ballynahinch had several inches fall inside an hour and this worsened as snow continued to fall. Dromara got it bad yet again and Comber reported several inches.The Department of the Environmentrsquos snow ploughs were in use at Carryduff, Ballynahinch and Dromara, and gritting machines were needed on many local roads.In Downpatrick and coastal districts there was sleet and heavy rain mdash and roads were made treacherous when this turned to ice yesterday morning. There was a spate of minor accidents as cars slithered through the snow and ice.Roads are being gritted by the DOE, but owing to decreasing fuel and salt they have only been treating priority roads.CROSSGAR mdash Crossgar is taking part in an appeal organised by the BBC programme Blue Peter, which will help provide bicycles for villages in Africa.The campaign, which involves the collection of stamps on Christmas card envelopes, is already well underway and these will be sold to buy bicycles which will help with transporting medical aid in remote African villages.Anyone in the Crossgar area who wants to help with appeal can leave their contributions at the Post Office.DOWNPATRICK mdash Representatives of Downpatrick organisations are asked to turn their backs on the wintry weather and go to the townrsquos library for a public meeting to consider plans for a major Maytime festival.A steering committee, which was born out of ideas kicked around by Down Councilrsquos arts committee more than a year ago, will present good thinking on how a wholehearted three-day festival of family fun will put the town in holiday form as never before.The centrepiece of the holiday weekend will be a pageant with a Patrician theme and possibly a medieval type flavour. Jousting is a distinct possibility and so are a number of other unusual dimensions.Although it will be called St Patrickrsquos Festival, the steering committee believe that a Maytime date would be better favoured by the weather than one on March  and would allow them to provide a much wider range of outdoor and indoor attractions.KILLYLEAGH mdash A Stormont Minister is to be asked to prevent the extension of a caravan park near Killyleagh.The unprecedented step is being taken by Down Council in protest against a recommendation made by planners to allow the development at East Down Yacht Club.

She always kept a respectful distance unless you had some Nutella.Describing the vixen as very friendly, Aileen continued: ldquoOne of the ladies I play with always kept food in her bag. She would lt out a banana and tried to feed Donny but she only turned her nose up at that.ldquoI happened to have a Nutella wafer bar so I gave it to her and she ate it right out of my hand.Donny was discovered nursing a badly infected wound. Animal rescuer Debbie Nelson from Debbie Dolittle Wildle was called in and quickly realised the fox had a raging infection.Debbie said: ldquoI managed to get her to the vet before it closed.

One of the biggest problems the local authority has to tackle is the hardcore of dog owners who point blankly refuse to clean up after their pets.Details of the new initiative were unveiled a few weeks ago. This week council officials confirmed that the campaign will be officially launched at the end of June.With the rates process well underway to determine the local authorityrsquos budget for the new financial year, councillors have agreed to make provision for new advertising and publicity campaigns as they bid to get on top of the dog fouling problem. Advertising the campaign on radio is also planned.Councillors and local authority officials are becoming increasingly concerned that a number of dog owners are prepared to turn a blind eye to potentially harming children who come into contact with the mess their animals leave behind.With the new campaign aimed at changing minds, dog owners will be reminded that it is their responsibility to clean up after their dogs and that not doing so leaves them open to an pound fine.Councillors say they are frustrated at the ldquoblatant disregard some dog owners and ratepayers are displaying and are keen to finally address the dog fouling issue.With a number of notable dog fouling hot spots across the district, the local authority is determined to do all it can to tackle the problem, given that it does nothing to enhance the districtrsquos image.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who is severely critical of dog owners who do not clean up after their pets, hopes the new initiative will be a success.ldquoThis campaign is long overdue and I hope that the small number of dog owners who break the law by not cleaning up after their pets will get the message that their behaviour is inexcusable, he said.ldquoDog fouling is a problem in many areas, even in my home town of Killyleagh. We are talking about a district-wide problem which we have not yet been able to get to grips with.

Part of Irish Street was sealed off, spaces in the nearby car park were temporarily unavailable, contractors were working in Market Street and much of the Lower Market Street car park was under several feet of water.ldquoThere were ious causes for these issues from early delivery of stone pavements for Irish Street works, flood water in the town and emergency work to kerbs, but we must have better coordination between authorities and there must simply be better communication with businesses in the town.Mr McGrath said he has written to businesses and forwarded his contact details should there be further issues as a temporary one-way traffic system comes into operation in Irish Street during work on the environmental improvement scheme.ldquoI have also written to the districtrsquos isional roads manager outlining my concerns. Newtownards, Bangor or Newry would not face public authority road blockages in the lead up to Christmas. Why should Downpatrick Mr McGrath said he wanted assurances that communication with the business community will improve and that work which has the potential to disrupt businesses will be kept to the absolute bare minimum over the coming weeks in Irish Street.The Department for Communities and Newry, Mourne and Down Council are jointly funding the environmental improvement scheme which will result in one traffic lane being closed during the work to facilitate the contractor.The work mdash which includes new granite footpaths, lighting and street furniture mdash is due to be completed before the end of the financial year and is designed to help regenerate Irish Street, providing a boost for traders and residents.Politicians are also confident the scheme can help arrest decline in an area where the presence of the townrsquos former police base was a major impediment to investment over many years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Jane Coyne’s The Suitcase comes to Down Arts Centre  ","story":"DOWN Arts Centre is hosting The Suitcase next month.The highly acclaimed production by Jane Coyle takes to the stage on Sunday, February , at pm and tickets are now available.The play was premiered at the Belfast synagogue for the  Belfast International Arts Festival and won the Audience Award.Now, in response to popular demand, it is being revived and toured around Northern Ireland during this yearrsquos Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations.The storyline moves between s Vienna and modern day Belfast.

The congestion also blocks access at the crossroads to Kilclief and Ballyhornan.Cllr Enright said the problem had been ldquogrinding on for a number of years and could no longer be ignored.He said it was no longer acceptable to say that roads congestion in Strangford and the problems on the Portaferry side were not the Department for Infrastructurersquos responsibility.He added: ldquoFerry service managers insist that the congestion in Strangford is not a matter for them, but for their roads counterparts.ldquoBoth departments are under the Department of Infrastructure which is why it is vital we meet with the Permanent Secretary to seeheads can be banged together and any budgetary issues resolved.Cllr Gareth Sharvin said there had been many occasions where vehicles queuing to use the ferry service in Strangford had a dramatic impact on the village.He added: ldquoThere is a perfectly good traffic flow system already in place which is not being utilised by drivers. We need to ensure there is enough resource to accommodate ferry traffic flow and demand to minimise the impact on Strangford residents.Cllr Billy Walker suggested the provision of a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry should perhaps be considered.Cllr Enrightrsquos motion was also supported by Cllrs Willie Clarke, Jill Macauley and John Trainor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Mahon Cup success for disciplined St Michael’s  ","story":"THE final of the long-standing Mahon Cup was played out before an appreciative crowd in the Drumaness clubrooms just before Christmas.In the final were holders St Michaelrsquos from Downpatrick and Queenrsquos Hall from Newtownards.League sponsor Gary Rodgers conducted the draw for the match pairings, which saw Gareth McKeever up first against Alastair McDonald and Bobby Douglas taking on Keith Lemon.McDonald got into his stride the quicker and soon built up a good lead over Gareth at  points to .

There was no school reputation, no building, no funding, no resources. They were unbelievable and were really pioneering.Naturally delighted with the honour mdash the first in her family mdash Mrs Roulston says that she shares it with a lot of people.ldquoThroughout my career, I have worked alongside so many wonderful and dedicated people, committed to making a dference to the lives of the children and to ensuring that they received the very best possible education in the widest sense of the word mdash teachers, assistants, dinner ladies, caretakers, volunteer parents and members of the board of governors, etc, she said.ldquoSo, on the day that I receive my MBE, I will be paying honour to all the people I have known and worked with and all those from other schools and sectors who show dedication and commitment to the children in our schools.The little people who she had the pleasure of teaching until she retired in  will always have a special place in  year-old Mrs Roulstonrsquos heart.ldquoI would like to thank all the children, those I have taught and also those whom I had the pleasure of knowing for all that they have taught me, for the pleasure they have given me throughout my career, for all the funny things they said or did which brightened up my day, for their kindness to me in all the drawings and little hand-made crafts they made for me.Originally from outside Manchester, Mrs Roulston has lived and worked in the south Down area from the late s after marrying her husband, Mervyn.After teaching practice in England and teaching in two very dferent schools in France, Mrs Roulston taught for some years in Greyabbey and Portavogie Primary Schools, as well as the Rupert Steiner School in Belfast, before taking a career break while raising her three sons mdash John, Peter and Timothy mdash in Kircubbin.ldquoI did a lot of cross-community work at that time as chair of the parent and toddler group, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoI also formed and chaired a community association and did a lot of work together cross community to get facilities for Kircubbin. It wasnrsquot a paid job but it was an important part of everything and I believe itrsquos where I first understood that cross-community work was so important.While working in Portaferry Primary School in the late s, she was fascinated on learning about a group of parents in Carryduff campaigning for an integrated primary school.ldquoI was reading all about it in the local newspaper and it was very interesting to me, but it was hot and heavy as well as there was lot of objection to the school, she said.ldquoI never dreamt that I would apply for it or have anything to do with it. But I did apply as it was a teaching principalship and it was working with both sides of the community as all the work I had done with cross-community work just kept saying to me, lsquoThis is really important work, this needs to be done to break down barriersrsquo.The road to establishing Millennium was far from smooth, however, as the grandmother of three can testy.ldquoYou just wouldnrsquot believe the terrible trouble we had and itrsquos hard to believe now what happened, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoDays before we were due to open, I had  primary ones and no funding and no site as there was a lot of opposition to establishing the school where we had originally planned to in the Carryduff area.ldquoWe ended up down at Breda Park, close to Forestside in Belfast in an old heath trust building. We initially rented it for six months but ended up staying for two yearsldquoWe were in a very derelict, vandalised, dirty building which we all very quickly had to work very hard get it up to scratch for the children.ldquoWe all had to break down barriers in many areas.Together with P classroom assistant, Mrs Marie Coiley, who still works at Millennium, they began to establish a school with an emphasis on total inclusiveness from the start.ldquoIt was very important to me that the school would be child-centred and the children would have a voice, explained Mrs Roulston.ldquoIt would not only be integrated in the whole Catholic-Protestant area but integrated at every level and it would be highly inclusive and children of all abilities and backgrounds would be welcome.After dficult early years in the Breda Park site, she believed that the school finally turned a corner when it secured a site in Carryduff to build around mobile classrooms in its third year.ldquoI always knew it was going to work, I knew it was needed and I knew that I was determined and the others around me were also very determined, said Mrs Roulston.ldquoIrsquove always been a very determined person and Irsquove alway never liked inequality or injustice of any kind.ldquoIt was very important to me that it happened and I was surrounded by some amazing parents who eventually became the board of governors.Shersquos rightly proud of her achievements and adds: ldquoI know I did good work.ldquoI must say there were days when myself and Mrs Coiley would often look around during assembly at all the children and all of the staff and wonder how did we get here.Now a director of the Integrated Education Fund, Mrs Roulstonrsquos hope for the future is to see a planned integrated school.ldquoIntegrated education is a growth area and I would like to see a situation the Department of Education and the Education Authority actually decide to plan an integrated school and not to be relying on parents having to fight for them.ldquoAll our grant maintained integrated schools have had horrendous journeys to succeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Tally’s Down torment continues  ","story":"DOWN fell to their second successive McKenna Cup defeat when Donegal proved too strong for Paddy Tallyrsquos side in front of just over , spectators at Pairc Esler on Sunday.The Down manager made several changes from the side that started against Cavan as he continues in his bid to unearth some fresh talent, but it was Donegal and their new faces that impressed.The visitors registered the first score when Niall OrsquoDonnell converted in the first minute.

The only part which has been agreed by both the UK and the EU is the withdrawal agreement itself, and so that is the part that would be legally binding.”Mr Wilson also previously told this newspaper that the government could write its pledge to end the backstop within a year “in blood” and it would still not be enough for his party.However, Mr Shannon’s comments appear to indicate that,a time-limit to the backstop was written into the Withdrawal Agreement – a legally-binding international treaty – it could be enough to bring the DUP on board.Mr Shannon added that, by backing Mrs May in yesterday’s confidence vote in the House of Common’s, the DUP aimed to “strengthen her hand in negotiations with the EU to find a better deal”.“She claims to be a proud unionist. This is her chance to prove it by standing up for unionism and ensure there is no constitutional change for NI within the UK,” he said.Mr Shannon said he was surprised by the scale of Mrs May’s defeat in the Commons on Tuesday, and felt that by delaying the vote on her deal from its original date in December, the PM actually increased the margin of her defeat. He added: “The longer she delayed, the more time MPs had to think about her deal and became more and more unhappy with Mrs May’s strategy.“It was a calculated risk that she got spectacularly wrong.”try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsPrisoner on the loose in N.I.          ..

Pic by Arthur Allison, PacemakerAn independent member of the Irish Parliament, Mr Ross had been asked by the Irish Independent, on Tuesday, about a situation where a lorry carrying food produce from Scotland arrived at the Irish border.He replied: “I would anticipate that there would be checks.”Dublin has so far insisted the border will not be hardened in any circumstances.Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney intervened to correct Mr Ross: “Well no,” he said, adding that the border would be dealt with through the political orce deal....all of a sudden wersquoll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.Simon Coveney,Irish Deputy Prime MinisterMr Coveney said that the Government had “deliberately not” gone into contingency plans because the UK had not voted on the Brexit deal at that point.“If Britain leaves without a deal well, then we obviously have to dficult discussions with the European Commission and with the UK in terms of how we protect the EU single market,” he said.However, talking privately at the end of the press briefing, but without realising the microphone was still on, Mr Ross queried why Mr Coveney had corrected him:Shane Ross: “Yeah. The border one, should I not have said that ” Irish Transport Minister Shane Ross said border checks would be expectedSimon Coveney: “Yes, but we can’t get into where they’ll be at this stage. They could be in the sea, they could be... But once you start talking about checks anywhere near the border, people will start delving into that and all of a sudden we’ll be the government that reintroduced a physical border on the island of Ireland.”Shane Ross: “Yeah, but I didn’t know what to say.”Asked by the BBCMr Ross had “let the cat out of the bag”, Fianna Fail Brexit spokesperson Lisa Chambers said Mr Ross was an independent TD who was outside the main parties and was “prone to gaffes”.

Ms Chambers sidestepped the question and replied thatthe UK reverts to World Trade Organisation Rules “they will equally be under pressure to apply border checks” but added that aside from the Irish backstop “I don’t have an answer for you”.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson responded that it is “little wonder Simon Coveney might fear a no-deal backlash, because they will have been a primary architect of such an outcome arising,” he said. This could be avoidedDublin accepts minimum friction technological border checks and political agreement, the DUP MP added.TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Coveney’s comments “reveal the truth that the threat of border posts comes not from the UK but from the EU forcing Dublin to do so”.He added: “If Dublin wants to avoid that then it is incumbent on them to press Brussels for Special Status for the Republic, which will allow it to keep the border open and protect its trading relationship with its most important partner - the UK”.The Irish government has been invited to comment.try catch  TrendingN.I. snow could arrive sooner than originally thought - Arctic blast could strike this weekendThis photograph from an N.I. railway station has sent Twitter into meltdownEmotional tributes to two men killed in Mournes fallsN.I. issued with severe weather warning - ice and wintry showers due in next  hoursPrisoner on the loose in N.I.          ..

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The site will potentially generate up to  new work positions across management, supervisory, warehousing staff and apprenticeship roles.Speaking of the new facility and what it will bring, Mr Rattenbury said: ldquoWe are delighted that our vision of a lsquoone stop shoprsquo for our customers is being realised and having a  hour, seven day a week co-packing facility in the heart of Wales, is a game changer for our industry. We can now offer our customers a streamlined product supply chain package by integrating their co-packing requirements with the grouprsquos warehouse and transport subsidiary companies.ldquoLogistically, this works out to be more cost effective overall, but also lowers the carbon footprint on the transportation of food products, which is something we are passionate about.Wild Water Group has a current annual turnover of poundm and Mr Rattenbury believes the company can increase that figure by a further poundm within  months and then reach poundm within two to three years.The project is backed by a pound. million investment from Lloyds Bank Commercial Banking and the Development Bank of Wales and has secured Welsh Government funding under the new economic contract.Using a similar business model to the grouprsquos other three sites in Merthyr Tydfil, Llanishen and Cardf Bay, the first phase of development will be the conversion of available space into a large ambient open plan co-packing facility, which will be operational early November  to meet festive season demand.During the first quarter of , Wild Water Group will move the entire Cardf Bay co-packing facility to Aberbargoed, once freezer facilities, production lines and machinery are in place.The company will then continue services such as frozen to frozen storage, bagging, over wrapping, sleeving and tray sealing, as well as the full spectrum of print labelling applications required under the Food Safety Technicalspecications.Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ldquoThis project will not only see a successful, growing Welsh business create an additional  jobs, it will also create a new strategic hub and facility for both large and small food and drink businesses across the region to pack or store products themselves. This could, in turn, open up new markets for those businesses ndash so Irsquom excited about what this means not only for Wild Water Group and Aberbargoed, but for the region more widely.ldquoIt shows that both our Economic and Food and Drink Action plans are delivering what we had hoped ndash jobs, prosperity and sustainable growth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business takes a further look A few years back, the options were fairly limited for NI firms when it came to venture capital funding.Now, between private funds, investors and those backed by Invest NI, the options have widened signicantly for companies – especially those which are high-growth – to seek a cash injection, and get to the next level.Jayne Brady is partner at the Bank of Ireland Kernel Capital Growth Fund NI.“We have been operating in Northern Ireland for five years, and in that period we have seen a growing momentum in the Northern Ireland ecosystem,” she told Ulster Business.“We have  companies in our portfolio, and have invested in eight companies in Northern Ireland as part of that.”And a lot has changed in the last few years, particularly with the sheer number of avenues in which businesses can find access to funding.“There wasn’t an availability of local funds, and it was dficult to get that level from GB, because you needed to reach a certain level.”And where is the investment now going in Northern Ireland  “It’s very strong sectors of expertise, and there is a big FDI element – medical technology, cyber-security. It’s not created in isolation, andan availability of skills.”“More recently, there has been more external investors. We would co-invest, and there is a level of investment from outside players – there are good opportunities.”Jayne says that Kernel Capital tracks investments, and the level and size of deals here has grown. A lot of that has been down to the growth of the Knowledge Economy – which has expanded seven or eight-fold in the last few years.For businesses looking towards funds like Kernel, a typical deal size is from around £m up to £m.One of the largest investments was secured by B-Secur, which has created a biometric technology which uses the human heartbeat to unlock everything from finance and healthcare through to cars and buildings.The company, based at Catalyst Inc, secured £.m from investors including Kernel Capital and ADV.For Jayne, Kernel is looking at companies with turnover of more than £m, which have the ability and scope to be scaled.“We see investment where there is a scaling potential. We look at companies where we are generating £m plus –– which you can scale rapidly, or those with a deep IPfocus. Some companies in services won’t have that level of scale.”Then, there’s the Growth Finance Fund, and Growth Loan Fund II, which provide a total of £m of funding for Northern Ireland’s SMEs.The two new funds are being managed by WhiteRock Capital Partners, a homegrown fund manager set up in  to manage the first Growth Loan Fund, which has committed £m of loans to more than  businesses over the last six years.There’s also the Growth Finance Fund. That will see loans from £, up to £m going to growing businesses. It’s also the first time the British Business Bank has invested in a fund aimed solely at supporting Northern Ireland businesses. The latest figures from the Irish Venture Capital Association, which covers businesses across the island, show venture capital funding has slumped, with a fall-off in major deals and seed funding.Investment was down by almost a third to €min the first nine months of the , confirming a signicant slowdown on .The drop-off in cash accelerated during the year, with the amount raised by tech firms and startups in the last three months just half what it was a year earlier.The figures suggested that the largest segment of funding to see a decline is in deals was above €m .But a Northern Ireland report by Catalyst Inc, published last year, showed companies raised over £m in equity capital in .Elsewhere, flying the flag for venture capital in Northern Ireland for more than  years is Crescent Capital.Run by Colin Walsh, former CBI chairman in Northern Ireland, it’s invested in a raft of the most successful and leading companies here.That includes Andor Technology and Belfast-based biotech firm Fusion Antibodies, which is based at Springbank Industrial Estate in the west of the city.According to Jayne, it’s not just about backing Belfast firms, or FDIs setting up shop in the heart of the city.“We look towards the strong sectoral focuses, and outside Belfast as well. We are very conscious to go to our customers.” That includes holding regular open events across areas such as Newry, Co Tyrone and Londonderry. “We are very open to meeting any companies, and our door is open,” she says.But will Brexit play a part in the future of venture capital funding in Northern Ireland  “We need to be cognisant of any particular indication of any change in regulation,” Jayne says.“From our perspective, because we invest in deep tech, they are somewhat removed from that direct impact.” Elsewhere, there are other revenue streams which firms can look towards, especially when it comes to working capital.That includes Upstream – an alternative finance company run by Judith Totten, which specialises in funding for SMEs.“As Northern Ireland’s largest independently owned and managed provider of working capital, Upstream works collaboratively with organisations’ existing lenders to provide additional capital in a more flexible way to help businesses thrive,” sales director Alan Wardlow says.“Businesses come to us for our responsiveness – our formal credit approvals are achieved in days rather than weeks or months. Upstream has long standing relationships with many local venture capitaland private equity providers as well as the ious Invest NI-backed loan funds and we work closely together to provide solutions for business owners across Northern Ireland“We recently incorporated a trade finance solution into our product range to bridge the gap for organisations who require additional growth funding, quickly, to deliver orders beyond their current capability. This funding is proving incredibly popular alongside our long-standing invoice finance option which gives organisations the ability to release funds against their debtor book thereby freeing up cash flow for businesses to seize growth opportunities as they become available.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ob_1.jpg","title":"leaders in business owen brennan","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Owen Brennan, Devenish Nutrition In , Devenish Nutrition was an agri-feed business, established in Fermanagh, with around two dozen staff.In the  years since its takeover, Owen Brennan, executive chairman with the now global company – which has its headquarters in Belfast – has grown the business from a firm with annual revenues of £m, to an international business now doing that in a week.“By the time we got there it was well-established for over  years. The shareholders were looking for somebody to take the business to the next stage.“While the company was smaller at the time, they were really keen to see it grow from the Northern Ireland base.“The business has grown substantially. At that time, the Northern Ireland revenues were over % of the entire sales. Today they are less than %.”However, Northern Ireland revenues are around five times larger than when Owen took over the business.Devenish has round  staff – across  nationalities, which is roughly the size of the entire workforce  years ago. But it counts Northern Ireland as its main base, and remains a key element of the business. The company sells into more than  countries.“The most important metric is that we spend around £m a year on innovation projects,” he said.“The big focus in  was seeing a niche opportunity for a specialised, innovative nutrition product, full-service business.”It deals in animal feed supplements – specialised high-value nutrients in a small pack. It also makes diets for small animals at the early stage of their lives, along with specialised nutritional products.And Owen says while the public hears about the negative impact of livestock, the positive impact isn’t heard.In his time at Devenish, Owen has been handed several accolades, including winning the BelfastCup  at the Ulster Farmers’ Union annual dinner.  “I’ve always taken those awards very seriously, and it’s the reflection of the work of a lot of people. I might happen to be the person that ends up being the recipient, but that’s only possible because of the success of the overall business.”He says, while sounding like a cliche it’s “genuinely a team effort”. “Part of my interestis that I see the parallels between sport and business.“Who is the most important person on the rugby field … actually, it’s everybody. If you have one weakness in that  or match-day .“If you take that analogy into the business area. I was once asked by a mentor, who did I think were the most important people in the business at that time. I said I didn’t know.“But he said ‘the telephone receptionist and the lorry driver’. He said those two people, between them, have by far and away the most customer contact in our business. I’ve never forgotten that. And  years later, I find that to be true.”On Brexit, Owen says the position among businesses has remained consistent, with a majority opposed to the UK leaving the EU.“The three things which have emerged to date include the diminution in the value of sterling – that has been a very bad thing for business, generally.“… the second effect has been uncertainty… le is uncertain, as is business. But anything that adds a large uncertainty in a business environment is not good.“The third is maybe a little harder to define. I think the debate around this leaves a lot to be desired. “People have said to me that the focus on immigration has made a lot of people, that would be described in those debates as immigrants, feeling very uncomfortable.“We are an international business, and had got to used to thinking of that international dimension as a good and wholly positive thing, so to hear a debate with that emphasis, with that sort of connotation for people of an international background.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gibsn_1.jpg","title":"outlook  the year ahead has forecasting ever been harder","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by Ulster Business Professor Neil Gibson, chief economist at EY Ireland says in two decades in the field, predicting the future has never been harder Forecasting is always a challenge but, in  years as a professional economist, I have never had less confidence in predicting the year ahead than I do now.  At the time of writing, the nature of the UK’s departure from the EU remains unclear. Estimates of the economic impact of ious exit scenarios ranged from -% in a catastrophic exit .Notably, all of the iants suggested a loss of GDP in the UK, though it also worth noting that GDP means virtually nothing to most of the voting public.  The prediction of % loss in house prices in the disorderly scenario is much more likely to focus minds. Moreover, Brexit is far from the only uncertainty ahead.  Trade wars are continuing, oil prices are slumping and stock markets are incredibly volatile. Many of the global warning lights have flicked from green to amber and it is entirely possible that  will be a very challenging year indeed. Despite the gloomy introduction, the base case forecasts continue to suggest a year of modest growth ahead. EY predicts a small contraction in the local labour market but most other forecasters disagree. This base case projection assumes a transition period is in place and that a global slow-down does not materialise:  two rather large assumptions to make. The optimism is partly borne out of what has been a remarkable period of job growth in Northern Ireland. The workforce jobs measure reports , net additional jobs have been created in the year to Q . This continues a trend that started in  and has seen the overall employment level rise by , since Q . This is despite very modest levels of recorded GDP growth and, finally, it has taken the region back above the total employment levels reached in . This performance is a credit to businesses throughout the region as, remarkably, all council areas have enjoyed job growth and all sectors outside of public administration have increased their headcounts since Q . The consumer is, perhaps, the most intriguing aspect of the economy heading into . Inflation is running very close to UK average salary increases, which means that, on average, people are not getting richer. However, overall consumer spending has been rising – partly because there are more people in work and partly because people have been willing to run down savings or take on debt.The data shows NI to be particularly vulnerable in this regard, with higher proportions of people without savings . The fragile state of the economy means,  probably, that interest rate increases are unlikely, especially with falling oil prices easing inflation, but the impact of a change in consumer sentiment and spending behaviour would trigger a marked slow-down. Consumer confidence measures are inherently volatile but there are reasons to be concerned. Confidence surveys have been edging downwards – the UK credit conditions surveys suggest a tightening amongst lenders in  and savings ratiosare at historic lows. Consumer trends should be watched closely in early  as they will prove critical to overall economic performance. TRENDS TO WATCH IN There are a number of economic trends I would expect to see in :Continued retail transformation: it has been a dficult time on the high street as consumers move increasingly to on-line shopping. A number of high profile closures have taken a toll and we expect this pattern to continue.  This will, as all periods of change do, create winners and losers and will  place pressure further on an outdated rates system that relies heavily on retailing. Embracing digital: the potential that new forms of technology presents has been clear for some time. Articial intelligence, blockchain, software as a service , data analyticshave long been touted as potential game changers. There has been a marked pick-up over the last  months in firms making investments in these areas. Maturing of the technologies and a tighter labour market are factors in these trends and we expect that to continue in . Pockets of growth: regardless of the wider economic conditions, there will continue to be pockets of very fast growth throughout Northern Ireland. The pipeline of professional services inward investment remains strong, in particular with US firms seeking talent a noticeable trend. Media and film continues to boom and, even on the high street, there is no sign of a slowdown in the proleration of coffee shops, personal wellbeing businesses and take away outlets. Volatility: share prices and exchange rates are likely to be incredibly ‘spikey’ given the turbulence in the world economy. Summary – beating the forecasters The Northern Ireland economy’s labour market has surprised me over the past  months. I hope that it continues to outperform expectations in .  Hopefully, there will be a transition period in place with a clear roadmap to a future free trade agreement between the EU and UK which may prevent the scale of slow-down I worry may be coming. While on the subject of wish-casting, let us hope that the Executive is back and operating too in . If all these pieces fall into place then next year’s outlook for  will be much easier to write.

Steve says as a result, “accidental encounters” lead to relationships and outcomes which otherwise, would not have happened.It also plays host to Queen’s University’s leading research body, ECITwhich itself is home to CSIT .Some of the leading thinkers based at the site include ECIT’s Professor Maire O’Neill – one of the youngest ever engineering professors at Queen’s, one-time UK Female Inventor of the Year and a leading researcher. “You have US companies looking at why would they want to move to Northern Ireland – they want to meet Professor O’Neill. She’s amazing,” Steve says.“Then there are cyber companies, like B-Secur. The firm specialises in technology which can read your ECG heartbeat as a unique biometric identy verication.“There are other indigenous companies, like Titan IC in cyber-security, Displaynote and ProAxsis. We have great companies that are now making a dent in the world.”And pushing forward with what his predecessor Norman Apsley built, plans are under way to expand and redevelop Catalyst further still.That includes another new building, Pierpont  – which will provide another , sq ft of space – and a revamp and refurbishment of Catalyst’s Innovation Centre, as part of an addition £m investment.“We want to make this the best place to work – improving the environment, the flow around the campus, the accessibility, and the experience, so that you love being here.“We want to refresh some of the buildings on the site. The Innovation Centre will be modernised by March and we will freshen-up our identity.”His big goal is to lead the way in two areas of technology and business at Catalyst – putting Northern Ireland front and centre.“We want to help to incubate two clusters where Northern Ireland leads the world.“How do we build on what ECIT is doing  We take the start-up capability, and ecosystem we have in Northern Ireland and leverage that further.“We want to make it easier for corporations to set up in Belfast and Northern Ireland in order to access amazing research talent. They want to define what the next big breakthrough is.“We can develop something for global companies that they can’t find where in the world. We want to create clusters, that will act as a magnet to attract hundreds of companies.”One of the unique elements of Catalyst is Connect – a network of experienced entrepreneurs, business professionals, top research talent and potential investors who provide their time and experience pro bono to help foster and develop the next generation of entrepreneurs.“It’s helping entrepreneurs to figure out how to build a company around their product idea and providing the support to validate and access the marketplace, capital, investment and or talent,” Steve says.“With the Connect network, we had  early stage companies or entrepreneurs engaged in our programmes last year. There is a lot of exciting and vibrant activity going on at the moment.”And it was Connect, which Steve founded and developed at Catalyst, which first drew him back home to his native Northern Ireland, following years of running and founding tech firms in the West Coast of the US.“I was an entrepreneur in Calornia for a number of years, in San Francisco and San Diego. I was there for the peak of the dot coms,” he said.That included his own start-up business, Kineticom, as well as other tech companies. It was his time in San Diego which resonated strongly with Steve.“Personally, I became obsessed with the San Diego story and the parallels to Northern Ireland. When they started on their journey in , San Diego had a population of . million people, % of their economy was dependent on the public sector. They have an ocean to one side, a mountain range around them and another country to the bottom of them.”San Diego went from the bottom of every league table to the top – with the collaboration of top universities, research and development and entrepreneurship, building the city into the tech stalwart it is now.The Connect  emanated from San Diego – a concept which help shaped the programme in Northern Ireland.“Meeting Norman Apsley at the Science Park was just the most beautul thing ever,” Steve says.The financial and economic impact and contribution that Catalyst has is hard to ignore. It’s estimated the businesses which operate there contribute around £m in GVA each year.“Everything we do is based on the simple belief that innovation has the power to transform our economy. People around the world are all innovating quickly, adapting new technologies, articial intelligence, for example. In Northern Ireland,people are producing goods and services, but are behind in adopting those new technologies, our economy is going to be in trouble as we will not be competitive.“The question is, how does innovation become the foundation on which everything is based ”And as a result of Catalyst’s research into the NI Knowledge Economy, an annual report published later this month, which acknowledges the huge changes to the workplace in the coming year, Catalyst is hosting their second Future of Work summit in May  – aimed at demystying how roles and traditional jobs are changing, right across the Knowledge Economy sectors.Of course, Brexit is still on the horizon. For Steve, the main concern is around the availability of talent. “The tech sector is hungry for talent, but with the uncertainty in the last couple of years, fewer people have been willing to consider moving to Northern Ireland. That places a lot of pressure on the existing employees in the sector.”“Long-term, we have to be optimistic and look at the opportunities which can come out of Brexit. The businesses within the Knowledge Economy are export driven, representing over % of all NI exports. With % of these exports outside the EU, the Knowledge Economy is the sector least dependent on Europe and should be the key for driving growth at this time of uncertainty.”So, for Steve, his level of optimism and dynamism is clear in his new role, one which he says he is “very fortunate” to have.“It’s a position which comes around so rarely, and whoever gets the opportunity is so blessed and fortunate to have the opportunity to lead. We have a talented team of people who are all passionate about what is possible. It’s so exciting. The opportunities and possibilities are endless.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/323433.jpg","title":"theresa mays brexit deal voted down business reaction","story":"Posted on Wednesday  January  by John Mulgrew Business groups have overwhelmingly raised concerns over crashing out of the EU without a deal after Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan with Brussels was overwhelmingly rejected by MPs. Ann McGregor, chief executive of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry “The business communities that we represent have always had a erse range of views on what form the UK’s future relationship with the EU should take, however they do agree on the need to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit. “To achieve this we therefore need an agreement that will secure the transition period and protect jobs. As businesses wait to see what happens next in Parliament, it is crucial that those at Westminster move beyond tactical manoeuvring and look at all the options in order to avoid a ‘no deal’s scenario. “Firms are in the dark on too many aspects of le after March . This has already led to many businesses taking action – pausing on recruitment and investment, stockpiling goods, and relocating factories in other parts of the EU. In fact, a third of NI Chamber members are currently putting growth and investment plans on hold in the absence of clarity from Westminster. There is however nothing to stop government acting decisively on areas within their control, such as migration and customs procedures.”  Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium “The result this evening will be a cause for concern across the Northern Ireland business community. Northern Ireland businesses desperately need certainty about the UK’s future trading relationship with the EU and will be severely disadvantaged by a no deal. A no deal Brexit means that Northern Ireland households will face higher prices and less choice on the shelves something they can ill afford. “Se need politicians  to coalesce around a workable solution that protects consumers from the costs and disruptions due to the loss of tarf-free and frictionless trade we currently enjoy with partners in the EU. We are now closer than ever to the possibility of a no-deal that will be a disaster for Northern Ireland.” “  Angela McGowan, CBI Northern Ireland director “Every business will feel no deal is hurtling closer. A new plan is needed immediately. This is now a time for our politicians to make history as leaders. All MPs need to reflect on the need for compromise and to act at speed to protect the UKs economy. “No deal would immediately put Northern Irish jobs and businesses at risk and jeopardise years of positive economic development and integration across the island.  It must be avoided to protect our all-island economy.”  Glyn Roberts, Retail NI chief executive “This is a disappointing but not unexpected result. While the Prime Minister’s draft Withdrawal Bill was in no way perfect, it was definitely preferable to crashing out of the EU with no deal. “The Government now needs to work on a cross-party basis with Labour and other opposition parties to reach a broader agreement for a withdrawal deal and secure the transition period, protect jobs and a positive future relationship with the EU  Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster “Leaving the EU without a deal would damage the sustainability of the Hospitality industry and impact on the potential growth of Tourism in Northern Ireland. We appeal to our elected representatives to work together in a spirit of consensus government to ensure that a no deal scenario does not happen.”  Tina McKenzie, FSB NI policy chair “With the clock ticking down to Brexit Day in just  weeks, we are running out of time to avoid a clf-edge, no-deal outcome. “A disorderly exit from the EU would be deeply damaging for small businesses, causing disruption to supply chains, increasing costs and stling investment. “A no-deal is something which we simply cannot countenance, so it is imperative that political leaders sharpen their focus and do all they can to reach agreement in the short time available.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
